 Novel thin sheets based on poly poly thermoplastic starch ternary blends were fabricated by incorporating thymol zinc oxide nanoparticles and thymol ZnO NPs at different concentrations . The gas water vapor barrier properties of the nanocomposites comprising the effects of polar and non polar molecules and their leading mechanisms were thoroughly discussed . Moreover the localization preference of ZnO NPs morphology along with mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposites were investigated . A significant improvement of 58 in the water vapor impermeability by 5wt ZnO and 12wt thymol loading was achieved . Finally the fitting of the Maxwell model on the experimental data revealed that this model can not correctly predict the permeation behavior of ZnO filled nanocomposites . Results suggested that these nanocomposites could be capable of being used as the packaging materials with high barrier performance .

@highlight The important role of O
@highlight  WV Permeability on the biodegradable films is discussed.
@highlight A mechanism for WVP through ZnO thymol filled compounds is proposed.
@highlight The distinct role of sorption and diffusion on the WVP is studied.
@highlight The effect of crystallinity on the barrier performance is investigated.
@highlight The Maxwell empirical model is questioned.
