 The investigation on the curing kinetics of phthalonitrile is of significance for understanding the curing mechanism and optimizing the curing process . Here the curing kinetics of 1 3 bis benzene promoted by tyrosine cyclic peptide was studied by non isothermal differential scanning calorimetry with the aid of two dimensional correlation spectroscopy . 2DCS revealed a multi path curing reaction of 3BOCN TCP system so the peak fitting was used to calculate the kinetic parameters of the two curing pathways . The results showed that both curing pathways of 3BOCN TCP system could be described by autocatalytic model and the calculated values could fit well with the experimental data .

@highlight Curing kinetic of phthalonitrile promoted by tyrosine cyclic peptide was firstly investigated.
@highlight Two dimensional correlation spectroscopy suggested a multi path reaction of this curing system.
@highlight Two curing pathways exist in the curing process and were individually calculated by Gaussian fitting.
@highlight The curing process may involve a switch from chemical control to diffusion control in the late stage.
@highlight The curing reaction of this system could be described by autocatalytic model with good accuracy.
