 Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight causes DNA damage in skin cells by formation of photoproducts mainly cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers which are reverted by exogenous CPD photolyase preventing photoaging and skin cancer . High performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for quantification of CPD photolyase activity was developed to search new enzymes sources for dermatology or clinical studies . The method was based in the enzymatic conversion of a 15mer oligonucleotide containing a center cyclobutane thymidine dimer to the restored 15mer oligonucleotide . Three ion pair reagent were evaluated by response surface methodology to increase mass intensities . Additionally chromatographic separation of oligonucleotides was performed . The selected mobile phase was 15mM diisopropylethylamine 20mM hexafluoroisopropanol in methanol . The method allowed total separation between the oligonucleotides studied by using the core shell technology which reduce the diffusion time of the analyte into the column increasing the efficiency and minimizing the analysis time at 7min . The mass spectrometry detection allowed a high selectivity and sensitivity . This is the first time where MRM modality has been employed with this specific purpose . Oligonucleotides recovery from reaction mixture was 94 and the limit of quantification was 13.4nM for 15mer . The method was evaluated with a recombinant CPD photolyase from
