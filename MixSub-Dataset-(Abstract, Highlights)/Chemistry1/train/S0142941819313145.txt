 The effect of hot air exposure at 150C for up to 12 weeks on the properties of hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber compounds with varying degrees of carbon black content was investigated and reported in this paper . The composition of the HNBR was varied with 0 10 30 or 50 PHR carbon black . The tensile properties hardness density solvent saturation swelling and carbon dioxide permeability of these specimens was investigated before and after exposure in a hot air oven . Correlations between these results are reported for the compounds considered in this work . These correlations illustrate how the changes in performance which would require test samples of specific geometries might in some cases be predicted by tests which do not require exact geometries for the materials investigated in this paper .
