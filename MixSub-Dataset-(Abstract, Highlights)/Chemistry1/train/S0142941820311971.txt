 Instrumental techniques such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy constitute well studied methodologies for polymer characterization including polymeric fibers . However a relatively short number of scientific publications involve the characterization of commercial Poly ran fiber and its surface species . The majority of the published infrared studies uses the medium infrared region associated to the Attenuated total reflection method . In this scenario this short review addresses the characteristics of Vectran fiber sample depth data of each FT IR spectrum mode reflection and photo acoustic spectroscopy including near infrared analysis . This paper addresses also researches on the characterization of Vectran by several FT IR analysis conditions aiming to contribute to future studies . This brief review deals with methodologies developed in the last decade and published by several scientific research groups emphasizing studies conducted in the last five years . A critical assessment and trends are also included .

@highlight The characterization of Vectran fiber has been little explored which offer opportunities for further research.
@highlight ATR Ge UATR FT IR microscopy and PAS are best suited for fibers and its surface species analysis.
@highlight Few studies have been found that use them to analyze Vectran behavior and its characteristics.
@highlight The existing gap in this scientific field related to FT IR techniques applied to the analysis of the Vectran fiber surface.
