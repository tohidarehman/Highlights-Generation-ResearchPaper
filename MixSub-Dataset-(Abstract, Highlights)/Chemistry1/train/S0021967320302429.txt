 Sensitive and specific analysis of zearalenone mycotoxin in cereals for ensuring food safety is critical and remains challenging . Herein a new gold nanoparticles @ aptamer functionalized hybrid affinity monolithic column was proposed and employed for online specific recognition of ZEN by HPLC . Characterization on the morphology BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area mechanical stability and specific performance of the obtained affinity monolith were investigated . A super high aptamer coverage density could reach 3636pmol L which is preferable to gain an effective analysis of ZEN with high specificity and a low interference of co existed substances including typical Zearalenol and Aflatoxin B

@highlight affinity monolith was firstly used for discriminating ZEN.
@highlight Ultra high aptamer coverage density of monolith column was up to 3636pmol L.
@highlight Online specificity to ZEN carried out by coupling with HPLC was fulfilled.
@highlight Sensitive detection was exhibited with the LOD as low as 0.05ng mL.
@highlight Practical analysis of ZEN in cereals was accomplished with good results.
