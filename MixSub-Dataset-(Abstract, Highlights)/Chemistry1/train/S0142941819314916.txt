 This study proposes composite stents with coreshell structure . Biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol yarns are twisted and then coated with polycaprolactone polyethylene glycol blends . The coated yarns are weft knitted into braids and then thermally treated to form composite stents with coreshell structure . The morphological mechanical and biological characteristics of the formed composite stents are evaluated to determine the effects of PEG concentration . Results show that composite stents acquire the flexibility of PVA yarns and elasticity of weft knits . The presence of PEG positively influences composite stent performance . When the PEG concentration is 30wt composite stents exhibit a compressive strength of 6.15N and cell viability of 97.32 after a 24h of culture . The selected materials are biodegradable and the novel structure meets the requirements of bioresorbable vascular stent which suggests that the proposed composite stents have good potential for advancement .

@highlight The stent is composed of coreshell structure includes fiber and polymers.
@highlight The stent uses the twisted PVA fiber as the core layer.
@highlight The stents acquire the flexibility of PVA yarns and elasticity of weft knits.
@highlight The biological activity test results showed no toxicity.
@highlight The components of the stent are all degradable materials.
