 Gas permeation of polymers is one of the important factors to be considered in the selection of materials for many packaging applications such as modified atmosphere packaging for foods . Poly is known to exhibit very low gas permeation compared with most polymers such as polystyrene polyethylene and polypropylene . However MAP applications require better barrier performance than that of PET . In the present work PET trays reinforced with organically modified sepiolite fibrillar nanoclay have been produced at industrial processes . Permeability to water vapour oxygen and carbon dioxide has been studied in PET nanocomposites as well as their microstructure through transmission electron and scanning electronic microscopy and their mechanical properties . Results show a better performance in barrier properties as well as an increase in tensile strength and impact resistance when the sepiolite content is lower than 2.5 .

@highlight It is possible to obtained PET nanocomposite trays with improved barrier properties in an industrial process.
@highlight Nanocomposite with sepiolite content of around 2 has a permeability to O
@highlight equivalent to that of PET EVOH PE.
@highlight Nanocomposite no matter the sepiolite content are stiffer than pure PET.
