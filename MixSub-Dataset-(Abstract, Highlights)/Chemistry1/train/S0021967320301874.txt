 A GCMS based analytical method was developed for the profiling of oil based AAS products using 15 organic constituents as target compounds . A total of 219 compounds were identified in 109 seized AAS products among them 15 target compounds were selected . The selection was based on each compound s occurrence reproducibility and variance between products . The 15 target compounds did not include the active steroid itself but only compounds found in the carrier oil . The subsequent method validation included assessment of specificity linearity precision robustness and sample stability . The method was finally applied for the classification of a set of 27 seizures of AAS products supplied by the police . The classification was based on the Pearson correlation coefficient using pre treated peak area data from the 15 target compounds . A successful classification was obtained with only a small overlap between linked and unlinked samples . A 1 false positive rate could be obtained at a threshold of 0.625 in terms of the Pearson distance . The present study thus demonstrates that it is possible to profile and classify AAS products with regard to a common origin . As the profiling method is not specific with regards to the steroid content it may potentially be used to profile and compare other kinds of oil based liquids .
