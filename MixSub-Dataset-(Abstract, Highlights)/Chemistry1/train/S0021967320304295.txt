 Continuous stationary phase gradients for liquid chromatography have been recently shown to be a promising method of altering selectivity . In this work we present the first multicomponent continuous stationary phase gradient for separations involving both reversed phase and strong cation exchange mechanisms . These columns are fabricated using a two step methodology based on controlled rate infusion . First destructive CRI creates a gradient of excess silanol groups along a uniform C
