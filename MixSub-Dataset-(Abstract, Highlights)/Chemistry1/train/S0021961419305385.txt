 Experimental heat capacities of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons benzofluoranthene benzofluoranthene and indenopyrene in the temperature range K are reported . Commercially available relaxation calorimeter was used for measurement . Performance of the apparatus was tested by measuring the heat capacity of copper and sapphire . However PAHs are available in a form of powder and therefore can not be directly placed on measuring platform as e.g . copper specimen moreover sample sublimation can not be ruled out . Modified three step method using powder sample or powder sample pressed into a pellet and inserted into aluminium DSC pans of different weights was tested by measurement of anthracene heat capacity for which high quality data are available in the literature . Pellets of higher weight in a pan of higher mass yielded results in the best accordance with the literature data this method was applied also for measurement of benzoic acid heat capacity . Finally datasets on heat capacity of benzo

@highlight Modified method for heat capacity determination of powdered samples was tested.
@highlight Low temperature heat capacities for three PAHs were measured.
@highlight It was found that obsolete data for Al
@highlight and Cu are frequently used.
