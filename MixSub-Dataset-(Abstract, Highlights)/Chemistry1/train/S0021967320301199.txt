 Although various cyclodextrins have been utilized to prepare organic polymer based monolithic columns there were few reports on fabrication of cyclodextrin functionalized hybrid monolithic columns . Herein a sulfobutylether cyclodextrin silica hybrid monolithic column was prepared by one step method via the co polymerization of hydrolyzed organosiloxane precursors and glycidyl methacrylate sulfobutylether cyclodextrin . The morphologies of prepared monolithic columns were observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy . The sulfobutylether cyclodextrin was incorporated into the polymeric structure which was demonstrated by energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy . The resulting columns were used for chiral separations of twenty six racemic compounds and satisfactory separation selectivity was obtained . Compared with other two kinds of neutral cyclodextrin based hybrid monoliths sulfobutylether cyclodextrin silica hybrid monolith showed superior chiral resolution . These results demonstrated the sulfobutylether cyclodextrin silica hybrid monolithic column was promising in chiral compounds analysis .

@highlight A novel sulfobutylether cyclodextin SBE CD silica hybrid monolithic column was prepared.
@highlight The SBE CD silica hybrid monolithic column has superiority over neutral cyclodextin based hybrid monolithic columns in CEC enantioseparation.
@highlight The SBE CD hybrid monolith was suitable for enantioseparation of basic analytes.
