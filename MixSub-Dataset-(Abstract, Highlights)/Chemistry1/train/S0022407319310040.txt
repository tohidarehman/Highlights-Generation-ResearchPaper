 The present work is the third part of a systematic investigation of the hyperfine structure of atomic Niobium using laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy . As in the previous two parts spectral lines in the wavelength region between 5540 and 6570 were investigated . In the present part we report on 31 transitions between lower odd parity levels and high lying even parity levels between 37 410 and 43 420 cm

@highlight Systematic investigation of the hyperfine structure constants of nb i levels.

@highlight  5 2.
@highlight All hf constants for even parity levels between 37 410 and 43 420cm
@highlight are given 16 of them new determined with lower uncertainty.
@highlight A misinterpretation of an hf pattern published earlier was corrected.
@highlight Saturation effects are taken into account when hf constants are determined from experimental recordings.
