 In this work a covalent organic framework Schiff base network 1 was synthesized based on the Schiff base reaction between terephthalaldehyde and melamine and characterized by scanning electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy X ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm analyses . The prepared SNW 1 was employed as pipette tip solid phase extraction adsorbent for the extraction of sulfonamides prior to high performance liquid chromatography analysis . The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency including the salt concentration sample pH amount of adsorbent and types and volume of eluent were investigated in detail . Good linearities were obtained between the peak area and SAs concentration ranging from 5 to 500 ng mL

@highlight SNW 1 based PT SPE strategy for extraction of SAs was developed.
@highlight Limits of detection were lower than 0.25 ng mL
@highlight The developed PT SPE HPLC method was successfully applied for milk and honey samples.
