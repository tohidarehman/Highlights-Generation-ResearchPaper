 As the 2020 winner of the van de Hulst Award I have been committed to the writing of a van de Hulst Essay which is presented here . The Award has been essentially motivated by my work on laser light scattering by particles which spreads over 40 years . During this time I may have obtained several results of interest but some of them made me feeling this kind of extraordinary shocks both emotional and psychological to which it is only possible to react by a booming Wow . Therefore beside a review on my work on light scattering the heart of the present paper is devoted to 4 wow stories related to the development of generalized Lorenz Mie theories . They concern the optical theorem the speed of laser light slower than

@highlight Review on the development of generalized Lorenz Mie theories.
@highlight Optical theorem and structured shaped beams.
@highlight Speed of light and nature of photons regarding particular effects.
@highlight Epistemological discussion on the underdetermination thesis of theories by experiments.
