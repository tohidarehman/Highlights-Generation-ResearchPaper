 The developments of analytical contactless conductivity measurements based on capacitive coupling over the two years from mid 2018 to mid 2020 are covered . This mostly concerns applications of the technique in zone electrophoresis employing conventional capillaries and to a lesser extent lab on chip devices . However its use for the detection in several other flow based analytical methods has also been reported . Detection of bubbles and measurements of flow rates in two phase flows are also recurring themes . A few new applications in stagnant aqueous samples e.g . endpoint detection in titrations and measurement on paper based devices have been reported . Some variations of the design of the measuring cells and their read out electronics have also been described .
