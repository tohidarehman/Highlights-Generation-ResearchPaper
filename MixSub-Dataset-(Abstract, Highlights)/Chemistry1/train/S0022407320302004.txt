 This paper describes the third part of a series of investigations to develop algorithms for simultaneous retrieval of aerosol parameters and surface spectral reflectance from GEOstationary Trace gas and Aerosol Sensor Optimization instrument . Since the algorithm is designed for future hyperspectral and geostationary satellite sensors such as Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution it is applied to GEO TASO data measured over the same area by different flights as part of the Korea United Stated Air Quality Study field campaign in 2016 . While GEO TASO has a spectral sampling interval of 0.28nm in the visible its data is thinned through a band selection approach with consideration of atmospheric transmittance and different surface types which yields 20 common spectral bands to be used by the algorithm . The algorithm starts with 4 common principal components for surface spectral reflectance extracted from various spectral libraries constraints of surface reflectance and aerosol model parameters are obtained respectively from k means clustering analysis of the Rayleigh corrected GEO TASO spectra and AERONET data . The algorithm then proceeds iteratively with an optimal estimation approach to update PCs and retrieve aerosol optical depth from GEO TASO measured spectra until state vector converges . The comparison of AODs between GEO TASO retrievals

@highlight An algorithm is prototyped for TEMPO to retrieve aerosols surfaces simultaneously.
@highlight The prototyping is implemented by applying GEO TASO data in KORUS AQ to mimic TEMPO.
@highlight Spectral AOD retrievals from GEO TASO are validated with AERONET data.
@highlight Principal components of surface reflectance are retrieved iteratively together with AOD.
@highlight Next step applications of this algorithm for TEMPO instruments are discussed.
