 Strong interaction between metal atoms and adsorbates sometimes leads to the formation of surface compounds . In such cases the registry with a metal substrate plays a key role in determining the overlayer stability . In this paper we present a structural model for a hexagonal Fe N monolayer grown on a square Cu substrate . The system exhibits a stripe pattern composed of dark stripes and bright

@highlight Monolayer stripe pattern composed of a single surface compound FeN on Cu 001 .
@highlight Separation to relaxed and compressive phases to be commensurate unidirectionally with the substrate.
@highlight Each single zigzag Fe atom row is accommodated in a 110 trough on Cu 001 .
@highlight Compressive stress is relieved by squeezing out of a third of N atoms and shrinkage of Fe triangles.
@highlight Mechanism to circumvent symmetry and lattice differences between an overlayer and the substrate.
