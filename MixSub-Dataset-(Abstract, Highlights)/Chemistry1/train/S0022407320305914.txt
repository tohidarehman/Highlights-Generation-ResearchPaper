 Turbulence induced wavefront deformations cause the irradiance of an optical signal to fluctuate resulting a in serious degradation in the bit error rate performance of optical wireless communication system . Adaptive optics is an effective technique to compensate for the wavefront aberrations to reduce the fluctuations in the received intensity . In this paper we investigate how the adaptive optics technique affects the BER performance of an oceanic OWC system employing binary phase shift keying subcarrier intensity modulation and aperture averaging . To evaluate BER performance in weak oceanic turbulence the required entities such as the received optical power captured by a circular aperture and the aperture averaged scintillation index measuring the fluctuations in the received irradiance are derived . The effect of adaptive optics correction of various wavefront aberrations on the BER performance is illustrated and the performance of the adaptive optics OOWC system is compared to that of a non adaptive optics OOWC system by the metric defined .
