 A cryogelbased semiinterpenetrating polymer network was prepared in which conductive polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole were formed within the super porous network of acrylic acid cryogel . For completion of cryo polymerization all the constituent solutions were severely mixed and placed into the plastic straws and kept at 20C and then the synthesized cyrogels were cut into the 1 cm length and freeze dried after washing with water . The CryoSIPN polymeric composite was applied in micro solid phase extraction of some selected antibiotic residues from various samples . The SPE method combined with a high performance liquid chromatographyultraviolet system allowed trace quantification of antibiotic residues in the honey and water samples while the significant variables were optimized using a central composite design to find optimum conditions . The method performance was satisfactory with recovery ranges from 70.0 to 109 . The limits of detection
