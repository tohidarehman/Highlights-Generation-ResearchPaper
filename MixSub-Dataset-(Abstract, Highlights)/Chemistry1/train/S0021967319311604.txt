 Triazine rings containing porous aromatic framework was synthesized through a Friedel Crafts reaction and investigated as a coating for the stir bar sorptive extraction of interest triazines . The triazine rings and conjugated groups in PAF 56p could interact with triazine rings containing herbicides by hydrophobic and interactions . The PAF 56p coated stir bar showed superior extraction performance over commercial PDMS and EG coated stir bar in terms of extraction efficiency and dynamics towards six triazine herbicides with different polarity . Based on it a method by combining PAF 56p SBSE with high performance liquid chromatography diode array detector was established for the analysis of six target triazine herbicides including simazine atrazine ametryn prometon prometryne and prebane . The affecting factors of SBSE were investigated by single factor test . Under the optimized conditions the limits of detection of the proposed method were ranged from 0.037 to 0.089g L with the linear range within 0.1200g L for six triazine herbicides . High enrichment factors of 61.889.5 fold were achieved . The developed PAF 56p SBSE HPLC DAD method was successfully applied for trace triazine herbicides analysis in maize and maize leaf samples with recoveries in the range of 86.5115 and 85.1114 for spiked maize and maize leaf samples respectively .
