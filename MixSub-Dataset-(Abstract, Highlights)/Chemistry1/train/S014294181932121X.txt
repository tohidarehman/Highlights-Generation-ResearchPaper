 This study establishes FEM modeling for compressive deformation behavior of polymeric foams with different loading rates . The polymeric foam used in this study was made from polypropylene with porosity of about 95 . The pore size and shape were randomly distributed in the foam . The X ray CT method was first conducted to observe the microstructure the geometric feature of which was reproduced in the FEM model . Uniaxial compression tests with different loading speeds were carried out to investigate an effect of loading rate dependency on the deformation behavior . By using the X ray CT method in situ observation of microscopic deformation was carried out . Furthermore FEM computations were carried out to simulate macroscopic and microscopic deformation behaviors . The random porous structure was modeled using Surface Evolver . The elastoplastic property with strain rate dependency was used in this model . The established FEM framework may be useful for a porous polymer with a random pore structure and for deformation modeling with strain rate effect .

@highlight This study establishes FEM modeling for the compressive deformation of polymeric foams.
@highlight X ray CT reveals that the foam had a random pore structure with anisotropic shape.
@highlight Our FEM modeling creates a random pore structure and simulated elastoplastic deformation.
@highlight The model can also include strain rate dependency in the constitutive law and simulate deformation behavior.
@highlight Microscopic deformation of pore structure buckling is successfully simulated by using our model.
