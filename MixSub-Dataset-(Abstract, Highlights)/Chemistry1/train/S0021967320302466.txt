 In the present study a new generation of water immiscible natural deep eutectic solvents was synthesized using borneol as a hydrogen bonding acceptor and decanoic acid oleic acid and thymol as a hydrogen bonding donor in different molar ratios . These green hydrophobic solvents which are chemically stable in aqueous solutions were used as extraction solvents for isolation and pre concentration of warfarin in biological samples . In this method fine droplets of DESs were dispersed into the sample solution by using the air assisted liquid liquid micro extraction method to accelerate the cloudy emulsion system formation and increase the mass transfer of the analyte to the DES rich phase . The borneol based deep eutectic solvent is a worthy generation of the extraction solvents in the ALLME method due to low cost and less toxicity . A Plackett Burman design was utilized for screening the experimental parameters . The effective parameters were then optimized by Box Behnken design . Optimized extraction conditions were pH of sample solution of 3.9 number of aspiration dispersion cycles of 15 the volume of DES of 60 L and rate and time of centrifuge of 6000rpm and 10min respectively . Under the optimized conditions the developed NADES ALLME method exhibited a wide linear range of 5500g
