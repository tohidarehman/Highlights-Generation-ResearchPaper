 Absorption extinction and scattering cross section spectra of optically uniaxial materials are commonly described by the weighted sum approximation also known as

@highlight The effects of material anisotropy on cross section spectra of astronomically relevant materials are investigated.
@highlight FDTD spectra are compared to spectra of commonly used 1 3 2 3 approximation.
@highlight Effects of anisotropy lead to shifted bands and or extra bands.
@highlight Effects of anisotropy remain also in orientation averaged spectra.
