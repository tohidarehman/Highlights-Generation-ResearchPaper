 An imidazolium ionic liquid modified phenolic resin was synthesized using 3 aminophenol as a functional monomer glyoxylic acid as a green cross linker and polyethylene glycol 6000 as a porogen . The obtained ILPR showed better extraction of benzoylurea plant hormones thidiazuron and forchlorfenuron than the unmodified phenolic resin because the imidazolium IL provides more interaction modes with the analytes . ILPR as a tailored adsorbent for solid phase extraction was coupled with high performance liquid chromatography for the simultaneous determination of thidiazuron and forchlorfenuron in cucumbers . Good linearity of the ILPRSPEHPLC method was obtained ranging from 0.0100 to 5.00gg

@highlight A new imidazolium ionic liquid modified resin was prepared via green protocol.
@highlight The ILPR sorbent exhibited excellent extraction to plant hormones.
@highlight The ILPR show superior adsorption property than phenolic resin.
@highlight A new method for detecting of plant hormones in cucumbers was developed.
