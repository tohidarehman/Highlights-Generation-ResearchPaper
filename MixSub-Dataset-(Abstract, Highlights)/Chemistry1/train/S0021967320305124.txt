 Atmospheric amines contribute to the nucleation and initial growth of new particles as well as secondary organic aerosol formation influencing the radiative balance of the Earth s atmosphere . In this study we develop an ion chromatography method for separating and quantifying the nine most abundant amines methylaminium MMAH

@highlight Nine amines are separated and quantified from common inorganic species in atmospheric aerosols.
@highlight Dimethylamine and trimethylamine are successfully separated using acetonitrile as eluent additive.
@highlight The IC method is robust for quantifying amines and inorganic cations in both urban and marine aerosols.
