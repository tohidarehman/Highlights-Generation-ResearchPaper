 This paper aims to effectively improve acoustic property of polyimide foam by regulating cellular structure of PIF on a large scale and introducing sharp hole structure simultaneously adopting a special mold with split structure in a closed mold foaming route . In this work PIF with same split structure but different pore cell sizes density and windows opening rate were produced in the first time . Due to the stepwise transition principle the impedance of the air acoustic medium and the acoustic material was well matched . In addition the characterization results showed the effectively effects of microporous structure and split structure characteristics of PIF on the acoustical absorption coefficient . For PIF 4 sound absorption coefficient kept around 0.9 from 900 to 6300Hz . Especially the resonance sound absorption characteristics was basically eliminated which ensured the high efficiency sound absorption behavior of PIF in the broadband range from 600 to 6300Hz region .

@highlight PIF with excellent acoustic behavior were successfully prepared by regulating cellular structure on a large scale and introducing sharp hole structure simultaneously.
@highlight From PIF 1 to PIF 4 average cellular windows size decreased by 48 pore distance increased by 76 .
@highlight Sound absorption coefficient of PIF 1 from 100 to 300Hz showed a value that higher than 0.4.
@highlight For PIF 2 and PIF 3 a sound absorption peak occurred at about 600Hz the slope from 100 to 600Hz arrived at about 1.4 kHz and 1.2 kHz respectively.
@highlight For PIF 4 From 900Hz until to 6300Hz the value of sound absorption coefficient was basically stable around 0.9 and the resonance sound absorption characteristics hardly exist.
