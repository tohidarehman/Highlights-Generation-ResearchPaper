 HDPE is a semi crystalline thermoplastic polymer with remarkable physical properties such as high chemical resistivity high impact strength and high modulus . Compared to the other semi crystalline polymers HDPE mostly possesses a high crystallinity due to which it exhibits a unique combination of mechanical and chemical resistance properties . In the present work we have characterized the crystalline spherulites of neat and formulated HDPE compositions thoroughly characterized by different electron microscopy techniques such as scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy . One of the critical steps to obtaining well resolved SEM images is the sample preparation that typically involves the etching process to elucidate the crystalline spherulites . Though such traditional methodology can effectively be used for neat HDPE it leads to the creation of undesirable experimental artifacts when used to investigate formulated HDPE compositions . An alternate TEM based method provides clear images without any artifacts apart from being a direct and green method and taking relatively a lesser measurement time .

@highlight The paper summarizes a novel simple and green method for imaging the spherulitic structures in HDPE.
@highlight While the lamellae are ubiquitous in the HDPE they cannot differentiate between monomodal bi modal or multimodal HDPE.
@highlight In the TEM method we are able to clearly elucidate the crystalline spherulites of neat and blended HPDE.
@highlight The TEM method avoids the use of acids for etching heavy metal stains and takes less time.
@highlight This method can be used to study the effect on crystalline morphology of incorporating new additives monomers or comonomers to HDPE.
