 The interactions and dynamic behavior of a select set of polar probe solutes have been investigated on three hydrophilic and polar commercial stationary phases using saturation transfer difference

@highlight Stationary phase ligands have a strong contribution to the selectivity in HILIC.
@highlight The retention mechanism has a significant contribution from oriented interactions.
@highlight STD NMR can be a powerful tool to investigate interactions in chromatography.
