 Hypercrosslinked polymers have demonstrated effective adsorption capabilities because of their richporosityandhighspecific surface area . However the HCPs prepared with phenylboronic acid based compounds as monomers via Friedel Crafts alkylation reaction have not been reported yet . Herein four new HCPs with phenylboronic acid 1 4 benzenediboronic acid 4 hydroxyphenylboronic acid and 4 carboxyphenylboronic acid as the respective monomers were prepared for the first time . Their Brunner Emmet Teller surface areas were 909.1 m

@highlight Four novel boronic acid based hypercrosslinked polymers were newly synthesized.
@highlight The porous polymers were investigated as the SPE adsorbents for the first time.
@highlight The PBA based HCP exhibited high adsorption ability for some chlorophenols.
@highlight An effective SPE method was established to enrich chlorophenols from real samples.
