 In generalized LorenzMie theory applied to structured beams the evaluation of beam shape coefficients constitutes a challenge . In this paper we propose to calculate BSCs of fundamental nondiffracting beams cosine beams Bessel beams Mathieu beams and parabolic beams . The aim of our method is the use of the Whittaker integral related to a scalar nondiffracting beam and well known angular spectrum decomposition . Also we exploit the relationship between solutions of scalar Helmholtz equation to expand the BSCs of nondiffracting beams in terms of higher order Bessel Beams BSCs . Some numerical simulations and discussions are given to validate our results .
