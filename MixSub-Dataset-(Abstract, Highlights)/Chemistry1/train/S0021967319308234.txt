 Plants are an important source of natural iridoids . This study demonstrates for the first time the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of iridoids belonging to the class of antirrhinosides . As iridoids distinguish the chemical composition of most species of the Plantaginaceae family the active AChE inhibitors were investigated in the hydro alcoholic extract of

@highlight HPTLC EDA hyphenation leads to isolation of new iridoids.
@highlight Antirrhinoside iridoids possess promising AChE inhibition activity.
@highlight A proof of concept for AChE inhibitory potential of iridoids was shown.
@highlight Structure elucidation of the active metabolites based on HRMS MS and NMR was elaborated.
@highlight Influence of the structural components on AChE inhibition was discussed.
