 In this work isothermal vapour liquid equilibrium data for the binary mixtures of pentafluoroethane 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoroprop 1 ene and trans 1 3 3 3 tetrafluoropene have been investigated . The experimental measurements were carried out by using the

@highlight The
@highlight analytical apparatus was applied to carry out the measurements.
@highlight The VLE data for the two binary systems R125 R1234yf and R125 R1234ze E were measured at five temperatures.
@highlight The experimental VLE data were correlated by the PR type WS NTRL models.
@highlight The systems exhibited zeotropic behavior at the studied temperatures.
