 In this study for the first time stainless steel meshes coated with poly and carbon nanotubes by solgel technique were used as the adsorbent for solid phase extraction . The coated stainless steel is loaded onto a cartridge and used to isolate and extract organophosphorus pesticides from water and fruit juice samples . Effective extraction parameters such as sample volume desorption solvent and desorption solvent volume were studied and investigated . Under optimal conditions the linearity of the method was obtained in the range of 0.03 to 80ngmL

@highlight Stainless steel meshes were coated with PEG CNT by solgel technique.
@highlight The coated meshes were used as adsorbent onto a cartridge for the extraction of OPPs.
@highlight The new self assembly SPE cartridge improved extraction efficiency.
