 Untargeted metabolomics can be a great tool for exploring new scientific areas however wrong metabolite annotation questions the credibility and puts the success of the entire research at risk . Therefore an effort should be made to improve the quality and robustness of the annotation despite of the challenges especially when final identification with standards is not possible .

@highlight Oxidized lipids in the untargeted metabolic profiling of neuroendocrine tumors NETs 
@highlight RP LC ESI QTOF MS MS analysis in positive and negative ESI ion mode
@highlight An increase of the concentration of the HETEs and oxLPCs in NET s plasma
@highlight HETEs annotation through spectral matching
@highlight oxLPCs annotation via reference native forms and mechanistic fragmentation pathways
