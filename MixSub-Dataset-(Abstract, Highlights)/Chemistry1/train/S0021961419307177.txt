 Often common organic solvents have been used in extraction and purification of ceftriaxone disodium from aqueous solution . Therefore in this study the conductometric properties of ceftriaxone disodium were investigated in aqueous solutions of 1 propanol and 2 propanol at

@highlight Conductometric properties of CFNa in aqueous solutions of propanol were investigated.
@highlight The molar conductivity increases with temperature.
@highlight The activation enthalpy of charge transfer in water is lower than that of water propanol .
@highlight The ion solvent interactions in water propanol are weaker than that of water.
