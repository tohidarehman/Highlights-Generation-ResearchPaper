 Oxy fuel combustion is a modern carbon capture and storage technique that improves the combustion process and reduces the environmental penalty of many combustion systems . Evidently the accurate radiative calculation of oxy fuel combustion is very important to obtain more improved combustion system designs with less environmental drawbacks . In the present study a small scale unconfined turbulent bluff body flame is numerically simulated to calculate the gas radiative properties using three different approaches of ignoring radiation applying a modified version of the weighted sum of gray gases model and employing the spectral line based weighted sum of gray gases model . First the selected bluff body flame is validated against experimental data . The early outcome is that the simulation results of three chosen approaches are very close if there is no oxygen enrichment . Next the effect of oxygen enrichment is carefully investigated imposing the aforementioned spectral radiation approaches . The achieved results indicate that the predicted gas temperature becomes more sensitive to the implemented radiative approach as the oxygen concentration in the oxidizer increases . In very high oxygen enrichment condition the gas temperature predicted by SLW model shows up to 155K differences with that of ignoring radiation approach . The simulation results also show that the oxygen enrichment would raise the CO
