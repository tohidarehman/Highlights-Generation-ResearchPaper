 A dispersive solid phase extraction method was combined with deep eutectic solventbased solidification of floating organic dropdispersive liquidliquid microextraction and used for the extraction preconcentration of some organophosphorus pesticides residues from edible oil samples . The extracted analytes were quantified with gas chromatographynitrogen phosphorous detector . In this procedure the sample lipids are saponified with a sodium hydroxide solution and then the analytes are adsorbed onto a primary secondary amine sorbent . After that the analytes are desorbed with acetone as an elution dispersive solvent and mixed with choline chloride 3 3dimethyl butyric acid deep eutectic solvent and the mixture is rapidly dispersed into deionized water . Then the obtained cloudy solution is centrifuged and placed into an ice bath . The extraction solvent is solidified on the top of the solution . Finally it is removed and dissolved in acetonitrile and 1 L of the solution is injected into the separation system . Validation of the method showed that limits of detection and quantification were in the ranges of 0.060.24 and 0.200.56 ng mL

@highlight DSPE combined with deep eutectic solventbased SFO DLLME has been developed.
@highlight GC NPD system was used for quantification of the analytes.
@highlight The method was applied to determine OPPs in edible oils.
@highlight Simplicity low cost less toxicity and effective sample preparation are advantages of the method.
