 In this study a three phase laminar flow microfluidic chip combined with HPLC was developed for monitoring free and total concentrations of paclitaxel in blood simultaneously . A diluted whole blood sample was introduced into the chip ethyl acetate was introduced into the chip for extraction and an interphase was used to prevent the blood sample from coming into direct contact with the organic phase . Because only free drug can quantitatively diffuse into the organic extraction phase and the free drug fraction has a linear relationship with the dilution factor of blood both the free and total drug concentrations can be obtained by detecting the concentration of paclitaxel in the organic extraction phase . The governing factor such as flow rate for extraction was optimized . Docetaxel was used as an internal standard . The reliability of the quantitative diffusion of molecules in the TPL chip was proved by the methodological investigation of PTX in PBS sample which showed a good linearity in the concentration range of 0.5 100g mL and a detection limit of 7ng mL . Good repeatibilities for retention time RSD of PTX is 1.23 docetaxel is 1.14

@highlight A rapid simple and low cost simultaneous determination of free and total PTX blood drug concentration.
@highlight An integration of free drug extraction from whole blood using a three phase microfluidic chip without centrifugation.
@highlight A linear relationship between the dilution factor and the free drug fraction in blood was found and established.
