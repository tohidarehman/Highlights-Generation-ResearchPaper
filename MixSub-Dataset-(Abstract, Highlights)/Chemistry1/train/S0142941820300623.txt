 Designing advanced biomaterials with regenerative and drug delivering functionalities remains a challenge in the field of tissue engineering . In this paper we present the design development and a use case of an electrospun nano biocomposite scaffold composed of silk fibroin hardystonite and gentamicin . The fabricated SF nanofiber scaffolds provide mechanical support while HT acts as a bioactive and drug carrier on which GEN is loaded as an antibacterial agent . Antibacterial zone of inhibition results indicate that the inclusion of 36wt GEN significantly improves the antibacterial performance of the scaffolds against Gram negative

@highlight Silk fibroin SF hardystonite HT gentamicin GEN nanofibrous is fabricated via the electrospinning method.
@highlight SF HT Nanofibers loaded with GEN exhibited great antibacterial performance.
@highlight The SF HT 3GEN scaffold showed higher biocompatibility than mats with higher dosage of GEN.
@highlight Increasing the amount of loaded GEN to 6 wt reduced cell attachment and metabolic activity.
@highlight The SF HT 3GEN scaffold formulation was used in the subsequent
@highlight studies.
