 In this study experimental tests and a statistical analysis are conducted to verify the size effects associated with length on the tensile behavior of dry unidirectional carbon fiber sheets . As a statistical method the two parameters Weibull theory is considered . To verify the validity of the Weibull theory four sets of direct tensile test were made on DUCFS specimens having different lengths . The direct tensile tests consist to evaluate the size effects associated with length on the mechanical properties of DUCFS such as tensile strength and the Young s modulus . The experimental results show a size effect of length on the tensile strength of DUCFS . Indeed the tensile strength decreases when increasing the specimen length . In addition the experimental results demonstrate that there is no size effect on the failure mode and on the Young s modulus of DUCFS . Finally Weibull weakest link theory is used to predict the tensile strength size effect on DUCFS specimens . A good agreement was shown between the test data and predicted results obtained using the Weibull weakest link theory .
