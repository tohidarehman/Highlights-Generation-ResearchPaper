 In this work two polyesters and four copolyesters were studied . All materials were synthesized to obtain the monomers dedicated for thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers . For this type of PUR the monomers should characterize by appropriate selected physicochemical properties and macromolecular structure distribution which depends on synthesis conditions . The study of chemical structure with extensive and knowledgeable analysis of formed macromolecules of synthesized bio based copolyesters was conducted with the use of FTIR and
