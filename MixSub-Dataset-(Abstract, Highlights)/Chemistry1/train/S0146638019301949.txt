 Black carbon constitutes a refractory carbon pool in soil and other environments . Estimating the amount and dynamics of BC in soil is important in terms of the global C cycle . The goal of this study was to characterize the contribution of BC to total and aromatic C in a variety of soils using the benzene polycarboxylic acid method and solid state

@highlight Black carbon BC content in varied surface soils correlates with aromatic C content.
@highlight Proportion of soil C present as BC varies depending on soil order or land use.
@highlight Relationship between BC and humic acids is analyzed.
@highlight BC shows a higher stability than the other types of carbon in Andosol profiles.
@highlight Contribution of BC to aromatic C is estimated for lower layers of Andosol profiles.
