 The distributions and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and plant derived aromatic biomarkers were analysed in Middle Jurassic strata from central Poland . These compounds were abundant in all samples indicating the occurrence of specific palaeoflora families and the intensity of palaeo wildfires . Moreover calculated fusinite reflectance values revealed that the temperature of Middle Jurassic wildfires may have exceeded 950C consistent with high oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere during this period . The high content of charred organic matter has an influence on certain biomarker maturity indicators based on terrestrial organic matter such as C
