 This work presents a new triptycene based dicationic guanidinium ionic liquid as the stationary phase for gas chromatography . To our knowledge this is the first example of employing a dicationic guanidinium ionic liquid for chromatographic analyses . As a result the TPG column exhibited moderate polarity and column efficiency of 3840 plates m and 3120 plates m measured by naphthalene and 1 octanol at 120C respectively . Particularly the TPG column exhibited distinctly advantageous performance for the challenging Grob test mixture and the isomer mixture of phenols and anilines over the monocationic GIL and its counterpart with dicationic immidazolium units . Also it showed higher selectivity towards the isomers of alkanes alcohols diethylbenzenes bromotoluenes bromonitrobenzenes than the commercial DB 35MS column . Moreover the TPG column achieved improved thermal stability over the GIL column and excellent repeatability with the RSD values of 0.010.05 for run to run 0.110.24 for day to day and 2.44.1 for column to column . Its application to GCMS analysis of the essential oil of
