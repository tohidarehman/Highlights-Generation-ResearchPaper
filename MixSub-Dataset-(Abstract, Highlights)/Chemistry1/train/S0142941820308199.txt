 The Technical Committee 4 Polymers Polymer Composites and Adhesives of the European Structural Integrity Society developed a draft protocol based on the load separation criterion to determine two fracture parameters an initiation parameter J

@highlight parameter m
@highlight  produced in the plastic region showed a size dependent behaviour.
@highlight displayed high amounts of scattering and an increase with increasing specimen size.
@highlight Calculated values of J
@highlight were confirmed via optical measurements of the plastic zone radius.
@highlight J R curves were constructed following the ESIS TC4 multi specimen approach.
