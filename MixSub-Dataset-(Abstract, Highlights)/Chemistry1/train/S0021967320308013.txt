 A self separating analyte compatible and efficient clean up method for QuEChERS extracts was designed and developed based on dispersive solid phase extraction using a branched polyethylenimine and nanoscale CaSO

@highlight A functionalized carbon nanotubes nanohybrids was first synthesized and used as r DSPE sorbent.
@highlight A self separating strategy was reported for the first time.
@highlight The use of nanohybrids overcomes the limitations in low recoveries for planar pesticides using MWCNTs.
@highlight The nanohybrids exhibits high clean up efficiency to remove matrix interferences.
@highlight The method is time and labor saving cheap sensitive accurate and precise for multi residue analysis in vegetables and fruits.
