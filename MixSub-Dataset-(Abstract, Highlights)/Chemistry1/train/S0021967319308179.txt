 Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptide toxins produced by various cyanobacterial genera that are toxic to both animals and humans . In this study a novel strategy was proposed for the quantitation of nine MCs and Nodularin R in lake water using UHPLC MS MS under negative ionization mode in which only centrifugation was employed during sample preparation . As a result limits of quantification ranging from 0.05 to 0.1g L for all studied compounds were obtained in water samples which were lower than the results obtained using positive ionization mode . Additionally validation was performed by spiking three different levels of MCs at 0.05 or 0.1 0.5 1.0g L . Recoveries ranged from 88.6 to 101.8 and intraday and interday variability were lower than 12 and 14 respectively for all targeted compounds . Furthermore the proposed method was applied to investigate microcystins contamination in fifty lake water samples collected in different regions in China . As a result MC LR MC RR MC YR MC WR MC LW MC LA MC LY and MC HilR were detected in lake water samples at trace level ranging from 0.06 to 0.37g L. The obtained results indicated that it was necessary to monitor the presence of MCs in lake water especially during regular cyanobacterial blooms during warmer months .

@highlight A validated UHPLC ESI MS MS method for the quantitation of nine microcystins and Nodularin R in lake water was developed.
@highlight Only centrifugation was adopted during sample preparation which significantly increase sample throughput.
@highlight The developed method was applied to investigate microcystins contamination in five lakes from China.
