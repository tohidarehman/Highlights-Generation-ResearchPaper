 A hybrid of flax and carbon fibers was considered as an effective way to enhance the mechanical and hydrothermal resistance of flax reinforced polymer composites . In this study hybrid composites based on three layers of cross ply flax fabrics two layers of unidirectional carbon fabrics and an epoxy resin were investigated in terms of the tensile three point bending impact and water absorption properties . The flax fabric reinforcement of the hybrid composites contributed to an improvement in the toughness whereas the carbon fabric contributed to an improvement in their hydrothermal resistance and overall strength and stiffness . The hybrid composites with carbon fibers on the surface exhibited brittle failure in the tensile test whereas those with alternating layers exhibited greater plastic deformation . In addition the failure strain of the CFFFC samples showed a negative hybrid effect whereas that of the FCFCF samples improved 63.5 compared with that of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites . A positive hybrid effect on the impact performance of hybrid reinforced epoxy composites containing the unidirectional carbon fabric and cross ply flax fabric was observed . At 40C and 80 relative humidity the diffusion rate of water molecules in the FCFCF samples was 16 times that in the CFFFC samples .
