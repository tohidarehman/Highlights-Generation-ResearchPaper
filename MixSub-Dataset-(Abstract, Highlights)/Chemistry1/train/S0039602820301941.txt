 Band gap opening in graphene on metals has been ascribed to hybridization sublattice symmetry breaking or conbinations of both . However how and to what extent band gap opens under the influence of these effects is not well understood and is still a question in controversy . In this paper we use first principle calculations to elucidate this controversy by focusing on Gr Ni which provides an ideal platform for the present study owing to a commensurate structure resulting from negligible lattice mismatch . Electronic structures of artificially expanded or compressed systems with larger and smaller Gr Ni separations

@highlight Band gap opens via hybridization and is enhanced by sublattice asymmetry if any.
