 Butanols can be incorporated as biofuels in gasoline . As a consequence the thermodynamic behaviour in the blend of the different type of accompanying hydrocarbons should be explored . Being a multicomponent mixture the best testing ground for checking prediction is the generation of the ternary systems made up of combinations of representatives of the indicated hydrocarbons two by two with alcohols . This paper reports the isothermal vapourliquid equilibrium at 313.15K of the two remaining ternaries of an overall comprehensive study involving 1 or 2 butanol . A recognized accurate static technique consisting of an isothermal total pressure cell has been used for the measurements . Data were reduced using Barkers method together with Wilson equation as excess Gibbs energy model enabling the determination of all phase equilibrium properties . Starting from our new data we complete the study by discussing the ternary prediction from four model equations by Wohl Wilson NRTL and UNIQUAC commonly used . Parameters fed by their constituent binaries reported in previous papers conclude that Wilson model provides the best result in both of our ternary systems .

@highlight VLE measurements are reported for the ternary 1 butanol or 2 butanol 2 2 4 trimethylpentane 1 hexene mixtures.
@highlight The investigated temperature is 313K.
@highlight The experimental data were correlated using Wohl Wilson NRTL UNIQUAC and Wohl equations.
@highlight A positive shape for
@highlight is observed for both systems.
