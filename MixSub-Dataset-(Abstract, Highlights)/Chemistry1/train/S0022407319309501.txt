 Lunar sun reflected light can be effectively measured through a low light band or a day night band implemented on space based optical sensors . Based on moonlight nocturnal observations for artificial light sources at night can be achieved . However to date an open sourced and mature Low Light Radiative Transfer Model for the further understanding of the radiative transfer problem at night is still unavailable . Therefore this study develops a new LLRTM at night with the correction of the lunar and active surface light sources . First the radiative transfer equations with an active surface light source are derived for the calculation based on the lunar spectral irradiance model . The simulation from this new LLRTM shows a minimal bias when compared with the discrete ordinates radiative transfer model . The simulated results of radiance and reflectance at the top of the atmosphere also show that the surface light source has a remarkable impact on the radiative transfer process . In contrast the change in the lunar phase angle has minimal influence . Also comparing with space based DNB radiance observations LLRTM shows the potential to simulate space based low light imager observations under an effective surface light source condition during the night .
