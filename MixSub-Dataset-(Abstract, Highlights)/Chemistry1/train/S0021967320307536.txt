 This research developed a new methodology using a gas chromatograph a pulsed discharge helium ionization detector and two mass spectrometric detectors . The detectors worked simultaneously using 8 columns and 7 valves . This new proposal for simultaneous analysis with a single injection and analysis time of 36 min allowed the quantification of 10 oxygenated compounds 3 permanent gases 3 sulphides and 4 thiols which are aggressive inhibitors of the Ziegler Natta catalytic systems . The RSD for repeatability of the peak area of the 20 compounds analyzed and the retention time were less than 0.59 and 0.23 respectively . The RSD for intermediate precision for the peak area was less than 0.85 and for the retention time less than 0.35 . 95 of the inhibitors analyzed showed relative errors inter and intra day less than 3 . The inhibitors detected and quantified were formic acid acetic acid acetone methanol isopropyl alcohol ethanol 1 propanol 1 butanol 2 butanol tert butanol CO
