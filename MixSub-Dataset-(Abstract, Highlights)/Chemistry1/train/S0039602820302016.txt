 First principles calculations were performed to study the electronic structure sodium adsorption behavior and storage performance of graphyne and beryllium and boron dual doped graphyne and their potential applications as an anode for sodium ion batteries . Results show that the maximum sodium storage capacity of GY in the ground state is 372 mA h g

@highlight The Be B dual doped graphyne shows a metallic characteristic.
@highlight The sodium ions own small diffusion barrier in two dimensional Be B DDG.
@highlight The OCV of Be B DDG is 0.108 V when 15 sodium atoms are adsorbed.
@highlight The maximum theoretical sodium storage capacity of Be B DDG is about 702 mA h g
