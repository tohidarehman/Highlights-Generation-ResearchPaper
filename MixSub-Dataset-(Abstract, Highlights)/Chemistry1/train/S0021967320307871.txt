 This study reports a simple and convenient analytical method for the simultaneous determination of biodiesel and vegetable oils or used cooking oils in petrodiesel and green diesel . The approach is based on normal phase high performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detection . It employed silica stationary phase n hexane mobile phase with isopropanol modifier to achieve optimum separation between hydrocarbons fatty acid methyl esters and triglycerides . In addition to determining vegetable oils or used cooking oils as adulterants in diesel this method is also proposed as a better alternative to the standard method ASTM

@highlight Simultaneous determination of biodiesel and vegetable oils used cooking oils in petrodiesel and green diesel.
@highlight Simple efficient cost effective and robust normal phase HPLC method with only 7min runtime.
@highlight The proposed method overcomes the limitations of standard methods ASTM
@highlight  IP 39107 and BS EN 12 916 2019 in biodiesel determination.
@highlight The method aims to verify diesel adulterants and support monitoring of diesel quality as per the indian regulatory specifications IS 1460 2017 .
