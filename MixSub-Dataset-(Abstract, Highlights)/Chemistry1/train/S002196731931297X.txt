 Drug containing nanoparticles are ideal targeted drug delivery systems . However methods for the simultaneous analysis of the drug within the nanoparticle and free drug in a short time are rather limited . In this study we developed a polymer modified monolithic column with cationic groups for the simultaneous analysis of the drug within the nanoparticle and the free drug . The use of the acrylamide group was determined as the optimum connecting group and the optimum concentration of the modifier was 6 . The prepared column retained the drug within the nanoparticle by anion exchange and its elution time was controlled by the ionic concentration aminomethane Tris of the mobile phase . The separation of two typical nanomedicines was studied on the prepared column . For DOXIL and Abraxane the drugs within the nanoparticle were well separated from the free drugs on the developed column . The developed polymer coated monolithic column with trimethylammonium modification is expected to enable the rapid analysis of various nanomedicines .
