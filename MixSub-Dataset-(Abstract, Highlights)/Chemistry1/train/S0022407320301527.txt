 We present a detailed investigation about the vibronic transition parameters as Franck Condon factors r centroids Einstein coefficients and radiative lifetimes for some bands of the second positive

@highlight Spectroscopic properties for five low lying electronic states of N
@highlight are obtained using ab initio based analitical potential energy curves.
@highlight Franck Condon factors r centroids Einstein coefficients and radiative lifetimes for the second positive 
@highlight  and Herman infrared 
@highlight  bands are reported.
@highlight Perturbations in the spectrum of the second positive system can be attributed to N
@highlight  C
@highlight None
