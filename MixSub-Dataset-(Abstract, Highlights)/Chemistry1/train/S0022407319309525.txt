 In this work laser spectroscopic investigations of selected electronic levels in the holmium atom are performed in the context of possible second stage laser cooling transitions which can be considered in a magneto optical trap . Five transitions were directly recorded by the method of laser induced fluorescence in a hollow cathode discharge . The hyperfine structure constants

@highlight Hyperfine structure hfs of 5 possible second stage narrow band laser cooling transitions in atomic holmium was recorded by laser induced fluorescence in a hollow cathode discharge lamp this allowed direct determination of the intervals between the relevant hfs components.
@highlight Hyperfine structure Zeeman patterns of the same transitions was investigated and the Land
@highlight factors for the upper even parity levels were determined for the first time.
@highlight A good consistency was found between the
@highlight values experimentally obtained in this work and predicted by the earlier semi empirical fits.
@highlight Preliminary semi empirical analysis of the oscillatorsstrengths was performed allowing estimation of the lifetimes of the upper even parity levels involved in the cooling transitions considered.
