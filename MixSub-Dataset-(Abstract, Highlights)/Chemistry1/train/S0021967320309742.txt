 A hexafluroisopropanol alkanol supramolecular solvent based magnetic solvent bar liquid phase microextraction method was proposed for extraction of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs in human serum . The restricted access HFIP alkanol SUPRAS was prepared by injecting a mixture of HFIP and alkanol into water . A stainless steel needle was inserted into a piece of hollow fiber to prepare a magnetic bar . Then the magnetic bar was dipped in SUPRAS to impregnate the wall pores of the hollow fiber followed by placing it into the serum sample for extraction . Only 4 L of SUPRAS was consumed per bar . The MSB not only functioned for stirring but also played the role of extraction and magnetic separation . Under the optimal extraction conditions which was obtained by one variable at a time and response surface methodology the novel MSB LPME was coupled with high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine NSAIDs in human serum . The method showed a good linear relationship . Method limits of detection and method limits of quantitation were in the range of 0.25 0.95 g L

@highlight A supramolecular solvent based magnetic solvent bar LPME method was proposed.
@highlight The magnetic solvent bar functioned as the stirrer for extraction and separation.
@highlight High density supramolecular solvent and magnetic needle avoid solvent bar floating.
@highlight The method was used for NSAIDs analysis in human serum with no need for protein deposition.
@highlight Restricted access supramolecular solvent and hollow fiber reduced matrix effect.
