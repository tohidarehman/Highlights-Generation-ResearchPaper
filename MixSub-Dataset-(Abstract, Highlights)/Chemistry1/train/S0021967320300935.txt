 Disinfection by products in drinking water can pose a health risk to humans . In this work a new nitrogen rich covalent organic frameworks was synthesized and applied firstly as a novel solid phase extraction trapping media for four ultra trace levels of DBPs in drinking water samples . Under the optimal conditions these DBPs were absorbed on a SPE cartridge then the DBPs were eluted with the optimized volume of eluent . The concentrated elution was detected and quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry . Low limits of detection 0.00040.0063ng mL

@highlight Novel TpTt COFs with high chemical stability were synthesized and used as SPE materials.
@highlight TpTt COFs achieved superior enrichment performance towards DBPs.
@highlight TpTt COFs was used for the enrichment and analysis of DBPs in drinking water.
