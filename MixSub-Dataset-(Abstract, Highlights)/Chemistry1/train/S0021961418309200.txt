 The paper presents the results of the Pb Sb Bi ternary system thermodynamic study . Experimental data were obtained using the EMF method in the temperature range from 873 to 973K . The alloys compositions related to the concentration triangle projections with ratios of antimony and bismuth mole fractions

@highlight The equilibrium potentials of Pb Sb Bi alloys in the KCl PbCl2 50 50mol melt were measured.
@highlight The integral properties of the Pb Sb Bi system were calculated.
@highlight The excess integral functions and integral enthalpy are illustrated in the concentration triangle.
@highlight The values of excess integral Gibbs energy and entropy are found.
