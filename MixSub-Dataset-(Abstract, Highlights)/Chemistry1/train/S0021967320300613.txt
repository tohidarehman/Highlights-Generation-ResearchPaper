 A new strategy for the preparation of mixed mode chromatographic stationary phases based on modified dialdehyde cellulose was proposed . Two novel mixed mode chromatographic stationary phases dicarboxyl cellulose modified silica DCC SiO

@highlight The preparation strategy of DAC based mixed mode stationary phases was proposed.
@highlight The both columns were prepared by utilizing the easy functionalization of DAC.
@highlight The HILIC IEC column and HILIC IEC chiral separation column were developed.
@highlight The both columns had good chromatographic performance in each separation mode.
