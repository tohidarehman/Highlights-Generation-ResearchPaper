 The partial replacement of silica by high specific surface area and high structure Carbon Black N134 as secondary filler keeping the same total filler content at 55 phr shows a clear synergistic effect on overall performance . At low content of CB i.e . in the range of 036wt of CB relative to total filler amount the Payne effect and tan delta at both 0C and 60C change marginally but thereafter gradually increase . Cure times are shortened in the presence of CB facilitating an increase of productivity . Bound rubber content and mechanical properties show an optimum at 18wt of CB relative to total filler amount or at a ratio of silica CB 45 10 phr . With regard to tire performance as indicated by the laboratory test results the abrasion resistance wet grip and ice traction can therefore be enhanced while maintaining the tire rolling resistance at the optimum level for this silica CB ratio .

@highlight High specific surface area and high structure CB has a synergistic effect on overall performance of silica filled compounds.
@highlight An addition of small amount of CB in silica filled compound facilitates an increase of productivity.
@highlight With optimum silica CB ratio wear resistance and ice traction of tires can be enhanced while maintaining rolling resistance.
