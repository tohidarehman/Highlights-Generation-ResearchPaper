 In recent years coreshell silica particles have been increasingly used for highly efficient separation at fast flow rates and relatively low back pressures in high performance liquid chromatography . However material synthesis techniques for producing CSSPs economically in batch processes remain elusive . In this report a practical and straightforward method for the preparation of CSSPs is presented . By refluxing freshly prepared nonporous silica particles in ammoniawater solution in the presence of poly at 70100C CSSPs with shell thicknesses of up to 300 nm and pore sizes from 8 to 25 nm were easily prepared . The effects of the synthetic conditions on the shell thickness surface area and pore size were investigated in detail and the method reproducibility was evaluated in scale up experiments . A mechanism of CSSP formation is also proposed . The CSSPs were characterized via scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy laser particle size analysis and nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments . The synthesized 3.4 m CSSPs were functionalized with dimethyloctadecylchlorosilane and used as an HPLC packing material exhibiting excellent separation performance for both small molecules and large biomolecules . In summary we report the simplest method developed thus far for the preparation of monodisperse coreshell silica particles suitable for HPLC column packing .
