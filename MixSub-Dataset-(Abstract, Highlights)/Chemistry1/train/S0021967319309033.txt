 In this work tetraalkylammonium amino acid ionic liquids were first applied to non aqueous capillary electrophoresis to establish synergistic systems with a conventional chiral selector native cyclodextrin . Excellent enantioseparations of some dansyl amino acid samples were achieved . A series of comparison experiments and a molecular docking study were performed to validate the synergistic effect of TAA AAILs and CD in NACE . Several interesting results were observed compared with previously reported chiral ILs related aqueous CE studies . In particular the direct enantioselectivity of TAA AAILs was observed for the first time by using it as sole chiral selector in NACE . This was an encouraging finding because it was the first direct and convincing evidence that AAILs were able to participate in the enantiorecognition process in the conventional chiral selectors based synergistic systems . The new TAA AAILs synergistic NACE system was further optimized in terms of alkyl chain length TAA AAILs concentration CD concentration electrolyte composition and applied voltage etc . Best enantioseparations of Dns AAs were obtained when 100mM CD and 10mM tetramethylammonium
