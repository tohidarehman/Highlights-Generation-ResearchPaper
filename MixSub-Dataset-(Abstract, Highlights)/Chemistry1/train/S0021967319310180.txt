 In this work the use of design of experiments and posterior data modelling by artificial neural network and least squares is presented as a suitable analytical tool for the performance optimization of a tandem mass spectrometric detector coupled to ultra high performance liquid chromatography for the analysis of seventeen veterinary drugs . Firstly a central composite design was built considering as factors the cone capillary extractor and radio frequency voltages of the mass spectrometer in order to obtain a proper combination to improve the sensitivity of the method . Secondly a one factor design considering the collision voltage was built to define the adequate voltage for each daughter ion . The response surface methodology was then applied and the prediction capability of ANN and LS were compared . As conclusion the ANN modelling provided better results than LS both in terms of the ANOVA and predicted areas results . The accuracy of the model prediction was between 85 and 125 confirming that the estimates of the model were correct and endorsing the optimization procedure as a suitable way to gather excellent results . The suitability of the new approach and its implications on the simultaneous analysis of seventeen veterinary drugs by ultra high liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection are discussed .
