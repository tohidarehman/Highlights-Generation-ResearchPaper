 The thermodynamic effect and kinetic process of maltose on methane hydrate formation were studied in this work . The gas liquid hydrate equilibrium conditions were measured using the isothermal pressure search method in deionized water and maltose aqueous solutions respectively . The experimental results show that maltose has obvious thermodynamic inhibition effect on methane hydrate formation . The dissociation enthalpies
