 The current study presents for the first time a combination of the gel electromembrane extraction and switchable hydrophilicity solvent based homogeneous liquid liquid microextraction methods which can be used as an efficient hyphenated extraction procedure . This coupled method which was followed by GC FID was applied for quantification of antidepressants in biological and wastewater samples . The effective parameters of both GEL EME and SHS HLLME procedures were optimized . Using an agarose gel membrane analytes were extracted from 7.0mL of the sample solution to 500 L of the aqueous acceptor solution . The maximum extraction of analytes of interest was obtained under the optimized conditions . Then the acceptor solution was transferred to the extraction cell and the SHS HLLME procedure was conducted again under the optimized conditions . Dipropylamine was selected as an extraction solvent . The introduced technique exhibited good linearities with coefficients of determinatin
