 The purpose of this research was to develop a novel multifunctional apparatus that makes possible to carry out two common tests of woven fabrics and flexible sheet like materials namely the shear and the yarn pull out test . We designed an apparatus that can be mounted on a universal load machine and makes possible to test the materials rapidly and precisely .

@highlight New testing device for shear hysteresis and yarn pull out tests of fabrics.
@highlight A mechanic pretension system generates and maintains a quasi constant preload.
@highlight The grip can be mounted to any tensile machine no need for auxiliary electronics.
@highlight The transversal preload and the clamping distance can be adjusted in a wide range.
@highlight Various textiles and flexible sheets can be tested rapidly and precisely.
