 This study examines the reactive surface dynamics of GaAs oxidation with molecular oxygen at room temperature over a range of impinging kinetic energies . Visualization of the surface by scanning tunneling microscopy after exposures to O

@highlight O2 with kinetic energy 1.0eV enhances the oxidation rate of the GaAs 110 surface.
@highlight Oxide development was visualized over time using scanning tunneling microscopy.
@highlight Morphologically and kinetically distinct oxidation mechanisms occur simultaneously.
@highlight The enhancement of GaAs oxidation at room temperature may aid in device fabrication and potentially the creation of abrupt interfaces.
