 This paper presents a novel mathematical framework to interpret the polarized lidar backscattering pattern for 1D water clouds . The framework is based on the multiple scattering of the lidar signals within small angle range . An approximation is made that both the outgoing and returning trajectories are assumed to be along nearly planar forward scattering sequences . For lidar axial symmetrical system a quasi linear mathematical relationship is built between the observed reduced Mueller matrix and the backscattering phase matrix and can be generalized to arbitrary scattering orders . For validation we extend the radiative transfer model MSCART to simulate linearly and circularly polarized lidar signals . Meanwhile we propose the azimuthal Fourier expansion to extract the reduced Mueller matrix results from the MSCART simulation . The numerical evaluation experiments demonstrate that our derived mathematical expressions could extend the polar angle dependence of the reduced Mueller matrix from second order to higher order multiple scatterings . The relation can serve as a useful tool in understanding lidar polarization observations and designing a CCD polarized lidar instrument .
