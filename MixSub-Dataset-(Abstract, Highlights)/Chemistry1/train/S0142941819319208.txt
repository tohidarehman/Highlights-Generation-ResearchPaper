 The present work aims to prepare thermal and oxidation resistant Natural Rubber composites using antioxidant modified nanosilica . The thermo oxidative aging performance of the composites was evaluated by the variations in mechanical properties after aging at 100C for 24h . The performance was further monitored through Scanning Electron Microscopy Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy Thermogravimetric Analysis and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis . NR nanocomposite with 17.5 phr nanosilica and 3 phr MNS were prepared and its rheological properties were studied . A comparative study of the theoretical models yielded that modified Guth Gold equation predicted Young s modulus better than other models . Thermal stability of natural rubber MNS composite was improved by 10C with pre eminent mechanical properties like tensile strength and heat build up . A linear relationship of compression set with modulus of all composites were also established . Equilibrium swelling test revealed improved crosslink density in NR MNS composite . The strong interaction between antioxidant and nanosilica enabled low migration of antioxidant in NR MNS composite . Hence its protective function after aging showed more effective than NR NS composites . These versatile functional properties of NR MNS composite suggest its potential application in electrical electronic and high performance rubber products .
