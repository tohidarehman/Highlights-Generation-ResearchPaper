 Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry has been a widely used technique for quantifying oligonucleotides in biological samples . However lack of simple and efficient sample cleanup approach remains a challenge . Our study aimed to evaluate the major factors during the sample pretreatment process for developing optimal sample preparation workflow for oligonucleotides . In this study we have employed a model formed with rat plasma containing a 16 mer oligonucleotide standard in order to comprehensively optimize the sample preparation procedures . These included liquid liquid extraction solid phase extraction protein precipitation and LLE combined with SPE . LLE with phenol dichloromethane was found to be the most efficient sample cleanup procedure with low cost and less toxicity . Followed by the extraction ethanol precipitation was determined to be the optimal drying conditions . Also mass spectrometric parameters were tuned to optimal conditions . It was found that the central composite design suite was proved to be highly practical for optimizing MS parameters . Finally the thoroughly optimized sample preparation workflow was fully validated . The developed assay provided a quantitative range of 0.251000nM with accuracy and precision were 7.45 and 12.20 respectively . Matrix effect and carryover were also evaluated and no significant effect was observed .

@highlight Phenol dichloromethane 2 1 v v surpassed other conventional extraction methods.
@highlight Ethanol precipitation 80C 5min was the optimal drying conditions.
@highlight The developed workflow provided a quantitative range of 0.251000nM.
@highlight MS parameters were optimized through the central composite design.
