 Qualitative and quantitative determination of volatile markers in aqueous based fragrances assumes ever increasing importance because of both the need for quality control and the safety regulatory limitations introduced for several compounds . This study reports and critically discusses the results of applying new water compatible ionic liquid GC stationary phases based on phosphonium and imidazolium derivative cations combined with trifluoromethanesulphonate to the direct quantitative analysis of aqueous samples in the perfume field with GCMS . Narrow bore columns of different lengths especially prepared for this study were adopted to minimize the amount of water reaching the MS detector after GC separation . All GCMS analysis steps were investigated to achieve results compatible with quality control requirements for the volatiles of interest in this field in terms of LODs LOQs and repeatability . Reliability of the GCMS results was demonstrated by determining volatile allergens in two commercial perfumes as per EU regulations concerning no declaration limits for leave on and rinse off cosmetic products .
