 Coronavirus virions have spherical shape surrounded by spike proteins . The coronavirus spike proteins are very effective molecular mechanisms which provide the coronavirus entrance to the host cell . The number of these spikes is different it dramatically depends on external conditions and determines the degree of danger of the virus . A larger number of spike proteins makes the virus infectivity stronger .

@highlight Coronavirus virions are spherical 120160nm in diameter with an outer envelope bearing 20 nm long club shaped spike proteins.
@highlight An increasing of spike proteins number makes virus infectivity stronger.
@highlight The mathematical model that describes the shape of the coronavirus virion having different spikes proteins number is suggested.
@highlight Based on this model the characteristics of light scattered by the coronavirus model particles are calculated.
@highlight Two main features of coronavirus model particles are found in the spectral region near 200nm a minimum of intensity and sharp leap of the linear polarization degree.
@highlight The effect of the spike proteins number on the intensity and polarization properties of scattered light was studied.
@highlight It was determined that when the spike proteins number decreasing both intensity minimum and linear polarization leap position shift to shorter wavelengths.
@highlight Far ultraviolet photopolarimeters are required for a more reliable distinction between viruses and non viruses.
