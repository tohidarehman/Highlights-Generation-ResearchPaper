 An ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry method was employed for chemical identification in a commercial polyvinyl chloride polyethylene multilayer film . Over 30 chemicals from different layers of the film were identified and were classified into 6 groups including antioxidants plasticizers slip agents antistatic agents adhesive components etc . Special attention was placed on the analysis of some non intentionally added substances and oligomers in adhesive . Based on the identification results six additives were selected and their migration behaviors were investigated via one sided contact migration test . The migration test was performed by exposing the PE side of the film to different simulating solutions at 40C as well as recording the migration level as a function of time . No obvious migration was found into water for all additives while the migration into 40 and 95 ethanol followed Fickian diffusion behavior and could be described by Fick s diffusion equation . Diffusion coefficients derived from the equation were in a range of 10
