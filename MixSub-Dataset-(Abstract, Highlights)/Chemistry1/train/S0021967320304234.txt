 A novel disposable styrene based solid phase microextraction fiber was synthesized for the detection of lipid lowering and antihypertensive drugs in real aquatic environment . Styrene and poly diacrylate were co polymerized on quartz fibers by thermal polymerization in capillary molds . The polymeric fiber possessed a homogeneous dense as well as porous surface showing excellent chemical and mechanical stability . The performance of the fiber was evaluated through the extraction of seven pharmaceuticals by coupling SPME with high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry under the optimized extraction conditions . The extraction efficiency of the fiber was up to 278 times of PDMS fiber and the enrichment factors ranged from 55 to 1183 . The limits of detection were in the range from 1.7ngL

@highlight A low cost polymeric solid phase microextraction fiber was prepared.
@highlight An SPME HPLC MS MS method was developed to detect drugs based on the fiber.
@highlight Low detection limits high precision and wide linear ranges were obtained.
@highlight This method was used to detect the target drugs in water samples.
