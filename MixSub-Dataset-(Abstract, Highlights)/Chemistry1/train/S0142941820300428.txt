 Balancing antibacterial properties with biocompatibility is of paramount importance for wound dressings loaded with antibacterial agents . In this work a water soluble antibacterial agent quaternized chitosan with an appropriate degree of substitution was introduced into the bacterial cellulose network by adding it into the BC culture medium . Results indicated that the addition of HACC could affect the yield of BC porous structure thermal stability water absorption and antibacterial properties . HBC 1 with a low content of HACC can not inhibit the biofilm formation of bacteria while HBC 3 with a high content of HACC has a low yield of BC and confused structure . HBC 2 with an optimum concentration of HACC possessed a typical porous structure acceptable thermal stability good water absorption and favorable antibacterial properties against

@highlight Adding HACC in the culture medium of BC could affect the growth kinetics yield and crystallinity of BC.
@highlight The obtained HACC BC films with 37.33 0.80 of HACC possessed acceptable yield of BC and typical porous structure.
@highlight HACC BC films showed favorable antibacterial properties against
@highlight and MRSA.
@highlight HACC BC films exhibited acceptable biocompatibility with NIH3T3.
