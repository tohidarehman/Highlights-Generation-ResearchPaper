 Previously reported works on the spectrum of Cs VII are critically studied using supplementary spectrograms recorded on a 3 m normal incidence vacuum spectrograph in the wavelength region 3001240 at the Antigonish laboratory . We confirmed the results of the earlier work of Gayasov and Joshi on this spectrum . Our analysis is supported by extended calculations with the pseudo relativistic Hartree Fock method with superposition of configuration interactions implemented in Cowan s suite of codes . In this critical evaluation in addition to the accurate energy levels of Cs VII with their uncertainties observed and Ritz wavelengths with uncertainties and transition probabilities the uniformly scaled intensities of Cs VII lines are also presented . A total of 196 lines attributed to 197 transitions enabled us to optimize the energy values of 72 levels in Cs VII spectrum . Furthermore Ritz wavelengths of 141 possibly observable lines are provided along with their transition probabilities .

@highlight Critically evaluated atomic data for six times ionized cesium Cs VII.
@highlight Accurate energy levels of Cs VII with their uncertainties observed and Ritz wavelengths with uncertainties transition probabilities and uniformly scaled intensities of Cs VII lines were obtained.
@highlight Theoretical interpretation of the spectrum was made using the Hartree Fock method with relativistic corrections HFR as implemented in Cowan s code.
