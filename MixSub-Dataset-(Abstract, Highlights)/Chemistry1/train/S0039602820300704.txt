 Via computation of a continuum dynamical model of the diffusion and electromigration this paper demonstrates the feasibility of guiding the formation of the stripe composition patterns in the thin surface layers of the crystal alloy films . By employing the systematic parametric computational analysis it is revealed how such properties of the pattern as the aerial number density of the stripes and the stripe in plane orientation are influenced by the major physical factors that are not limited to the electric field strength and its direction angle in the plane but also include a number of parameters that originate in the anisotropy of diffusion in the particular crystallographically oriented surface layer . By following the insights from this analysis the real patterns hopefully can be created in a dedicated experiment .

@highlight The model shows the feasibility of guiding the formation of the stripe composition patterns in the thin surface layers of the crystal alloy films.
@highlight Features of the stripe pattern are affected by the electric field strength its in plane direction angle and by the surface diffusion anisotropy.
@highlight Through the choice of the alloy low index surface direction of the applied electric field etc. the stripe pattern may be guided in experiment.
