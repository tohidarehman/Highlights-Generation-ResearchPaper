 A new miniaturised capillary flow through deep UV absorbance detector has been developed using a microscale surface mounted device type light emitting diode emitting at 235 nm and with a half height band width of 12 nm and a high sensitivity Z shaped flow cell . Compared with a previously reported TO 39 ball lens LEDs emitting at 235 nm the new generation LED produced a 20 fold higher optical output and delivered up to 35 times increase in external quantum efficiency . The Z cell was based on a reflective rectangular optical path with cross sectional dimensions of 100100 m and a physical optical pathlength of 1.2 mm . Inclusion of UV transparent fused silica ball lenses between the SMD and the Z cell improved light transmission by a factor of 9 and improved the detector signal to noise ratio by a factor of 2.2 at the same input current . The detector was housed within an Al housing fitted with a cooling fan and demonstrated excellent linearity with stray light down to 0.06 and an effective pathlength of 1.1 mm . The resultant detector was fitted successfully into a briefcase sized portable capillary HPLC system and practically demonstrated with the detection of a mixture of 13 test compounds at the sub mg L

@highlight High output power deep UV 235 nm wide angle SMD type LED was characterised.
@highlight A simple method for improving optical design of detector was presented.
@highlight Limit of detection was boosted by 2.2 fold with 9 fold enhanced light throughput.
@highlight The 235 nm UV detector was used in a portable capillary scale LC.
