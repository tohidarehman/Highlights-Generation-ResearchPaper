 High density polyethylene is widely used in biomedical field except when strong cell material interactions and high mechanical properties are required . To address this pitfall two kinds of chitosan in different amounts were used as filler in the present research . Composites were prepared by melt extrusion process and their microstructural thermal and mechanical properties were widely investigated . Also roughness and wettability were studied as features of paramount importance in dictating cell response .

@highlight HDPE chitosan composites were prepared for subdermal cranio facial scaffolds.
@highlight Chitosan improves both Young modulus and tensile strength of HDPE.
@highlight Storage modulus of HDPE chitosan 98 2 increases more than 100 respect to HDPE.
@highlight Chitosan hinders cell proliferation at concentration higher than 2wt .
