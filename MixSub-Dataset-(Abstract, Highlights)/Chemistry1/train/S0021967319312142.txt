 Potassium bromate is a food additive used as flour improver in the baking industry . Bromate is considered a carcinogenic and nephrotoxic substance . Thus the bromate concentration must be carefully monitored in flour products . We developed a method for a selective and sensitive determination of bromate in flour that uses ion chromatography coupled with single quadrupole mass spectrometry . A recently introduced high capacity anion exchange column was used to separate bromate from matrix anions . Six commercial flour and flour products including homemade bread baked using flour containing potassium bromate were analyzed . The method showed good precision with RSDs 0.2 and 5

@highlight A high capacity ion exchange column was used to separate bromate from matrix anions.
@highlight The MS provided high specificity for samples with an unresolved bromate peak.
@highlight Bread baked using 65mg Kg KBrO
@highlight showed 60g kg residual bromate after baking.
@highlight Method showed good accuracy with recovery of 86110 for bromate in the samples.
