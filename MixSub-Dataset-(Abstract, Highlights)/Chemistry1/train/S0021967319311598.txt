 The research of natural active substances is facing the problems of low separation efficiency and active component loss due to the complex composition of natural extracts . In this study a strategy based on liquid liquid refining extraction and high speed counter current chromatography was established to solve this problem . Separation of an active compound with the amylase inhibitory activity from

@highlight Liquid liquid refining extraction assisted the bioassay guided separation.
@highlight Consecutive HSCCC was used to prepare the active compound.
@highlight Separation efficiency was improved.
@highlight Luteolin with amylase inhibitory activity was obtained from
@highlight Theoretical explanation of luteolin against amylase was studied by docking.
