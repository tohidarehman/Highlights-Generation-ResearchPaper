 Guided bone regeneration have been proved great success for the treatment of bone defects in oral implantology . Bone defects are reconstructed by the use of a barrier membrane which prevents the invasion of soft tissue and create a space for guiding new bone growth into the bone defect . To develop GBR membranes with higher bioactivity poly fibrous membranes containing tricalcium phosphate were fabricated

@highlight Electrospun fibrous membranes with optimal pore size avoid fibroblasts infiltration.
@highlight Porosity allows osteoblast migration and attachment providing a good interlayer adhesion.
@highlight  TCP increases mechanical properties and bioactivity of PLGA TCP membranes.
@highlight Adequate quantity of TCP improves osteoblast proliferation and bone regeneration.
