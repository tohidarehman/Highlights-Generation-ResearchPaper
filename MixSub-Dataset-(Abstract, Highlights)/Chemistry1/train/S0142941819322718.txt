 One of the most widely applied enhanced oil recovery processes is the polymer flooding in which aqueous solution of polymer viscosifier is introduced in oil reservoirs to increase the recuperation of the remaining oil . From the current challenges of this process it can be referred to a high cost of materials regarding their substantially required amount and the low impact on the mobility ratio during the process due to the reduction of solution viscosity at high temperatures and high salinity environments . The purpose of this study is to investigate the concept of acrylamide based thermosassociating copolymer with a specific morphology and chemistry as viscosity enhancer at harsh conditions of high temperature and salinity . For that aim a specific TAP microstructure was targeted . It is achieved in this study throughout applying the reaction engineering approach such as synthesis in semi batch mode or and in heterogeneous dispersed media . As a result the synthesized TAP presented excellent behavior as viscosity enhancer especially under high temperature and salinity conditions with improved performance in comparison to TAP synthesized by a conventional solution polymerization approach and to actual commercial high molar mass acrylamide based polymer .

@highlight Acrylamide diacetoneacrylamide based graft copolymers were synthesized in three steps.
@highlight Very high molar mass and improved copolymer homogeneity was targeted.
@highlight Reaction engineering was applied semicontinuous and inverse emulsion polymerization.
@highlight High molar mass thermoassociating copolymer TAP was obtained.
@highlight TAP has efficient viscosifying properties at decreased content and harsh conditions.
