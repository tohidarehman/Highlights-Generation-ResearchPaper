 Densities and viscosities of ternary system and three corresponding binary systems and were determined at 7 temperatures from 293.15K to 323.15K . For the ternary system and binary systems the excess molar volumes

@highlight Density and viscosity of ethylcyclohexane 1 butanol ethyl caprylate mixtureswere investigated.
@highlight Excess molar volumes and viscosity deviationwere calculated and correlated.
@highlight The change of
@highlight and
@highlight is mainly due to the change of hydrogen bond and molecular structures.
