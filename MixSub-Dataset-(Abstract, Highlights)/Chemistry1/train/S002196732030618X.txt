 In this study a magnetized polyethylene composite has been prepared using ball milling procedure and employed as an efficient sorbent in magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction combined with dispersive liquidliquid microextraction . This method has been utilized for the extraction and preconcentration of some pesticides from fruit juices prior to their quantification by gas chromatographyflame ionization detection . The prepared sorbent consisted of the natural iron oxide coated with polyethylene . In the present work first a few mg of the magnetic composite is added into an aqueous solution containing the analytes and vortexed . After that the analytes are eluted with

@highlight A new analytical method based on MDSPEDLLMEGCFID was developed.
@highlight For the first time a composite prepared from sand and polyethylene was used as a magnetic sorbent.
@highlight The sorbent did not need synthesis and easily prepared through ball milling procedure.
@highlight The method was used for analysis of multiclass pesticide residues in fruit juice.
@highlight LODs and LOQs were achievable at g L
@highlight level using GC
@highlight FID.
