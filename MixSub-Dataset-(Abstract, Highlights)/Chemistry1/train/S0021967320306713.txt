 Nowadays enantioseparation of racemic pharmaceuticals in preparations is a prime concern by drug authorities across the globe . In the present work it was attempted to develop novel enantioselective extraction method for five clinicallyused drugs as racemates . The enantioselective solid liquid extraction of these racemic drugs was carried out successfully by the use of chiral ionic liquid in combination with a metal organic framework for the first time . The composite

@highlight CIL was used in developing agent of TLC for enantioseparation for the first time.
@highlight Good results were achieved for various racemates by dispersive biphase extraction.
