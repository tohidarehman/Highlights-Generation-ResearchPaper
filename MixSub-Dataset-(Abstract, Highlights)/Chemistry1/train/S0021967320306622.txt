 In this study the microcrystalline cellulose metal organic framework 199 hybrid was applied as sorbent for the dispersive micro solid phase extraction of chlorophenols . The D SPE method combined with high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection was employed to determine of four chlorophenols including 2 chlorophenol 4 chlorophenol 2 3 dichlorophenol and 2 5 dichlorophenol in aqueous . The main parameters of the D SPE process that influence the extraction were investigated and optimized . Based on the outputs the presence of MCC on the surface of MOF 199 leads to improve the properties of MOF 199 and the MCC MOF 199 has the highest sorption capacity durability and porosity in comparison with MCC and MOF 199 . According to the validation study at the optimized conditions the linearity for the analytes was achieved in the range from 0.1 to 200 ng mL
