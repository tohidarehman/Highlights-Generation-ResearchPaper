 Abraham model correlations reported by Marlot and coworkers for the 1 octanol water 1 butanol water ethyl acetate water and heptane methanol biphasic partitioning systems are compared to previously published Abraham model correlations . The previously published correlations for the fore mentioned partitioning systems are based on more experimental data points and exhibit much better descriptive ability as evidenced by much smaller standard deviations standard errors and larger squared correlation coefficients .

@highlight Published Abraham model eqns. found for 4 biphasic systems studied by Marlot etal
@highlight Authors and published Abraham model log P equationss differ greatly
@highlight Authors Abraham model eqn. does not describe experimental octanol water data
