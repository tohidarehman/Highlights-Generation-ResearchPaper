 Consumption of sports drinks is generally associated with a healthy lifestyle despites a common addition of colorants and preservatives to these products . This work presents the novel methods based on high performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis aimed at the simultaneous quantification of both these groups of additives within a single separation . The results obtained show that colorants are generally added in low and rather safe amounts whereas preservatives are much more abundant and likely pose a potential risk especially for children . The overall potential of the HPLC and CE methods was critically assessed and compared using the RGB additive color model a user friendly tool that allows one to point out and encode particular capabilities and general potential of a method using colors and to express its holistic effectiveness with one integrated quantitative parameter from 0 to 100 . As a result the potential predispositions of both methods were delineated .

@highlight Food preservatives and colorants quantified in sports drinks by CE and HPLC methods.
@highlight Amounts of colorants are rather safe whereas preservatives potential dangerous.
@highlight CE and HPLC were profoundly and transparently compared using the RGB color model.
@highlight The choice of a better method depends on the weight of the green criteria.
