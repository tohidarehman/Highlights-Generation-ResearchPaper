 Fractal aggregate model has shown significant superiority in simulating integral optical properties of soot aerosol . In this study angular distributions of scattering matrices for soot samples were measured at 532nm wavelength . Experiments were conducted over scattering angles from 5 to 175 using an improved and validated apparatus . Soot particles emitted from burning of toluene and n heptane were collected and re aerosolized for matrix measurements . Electrical mobility diameter distributions of soot aggregates were measured and converted to volume equivalent diameter distributions according to various conversion factors . Size distributions of soot monomers and fractal parameters were obtained through statistical analyses of transmission electron microscope images . Fractal aggregate models were generated by a tunable particle cluster algorithm using measured size distributions of aggregates and statistically obtained morphological parameters . Multiple sphere
