 The energy levels and electric dipole matrix elements of Rb atom are calculated using the relativistic configuration interaction with core polarization method . These energy levels and matrix elements are further employed to calculate the electric dipole static and dynamic polarizabilities of the 5

@highlight Static and dynamic polarizabilities of the 5
