 In the present study to improve separation proficiency of polyvinyl chloride membrane polyvinyl chloride is combined with 1butyl4methylpyridinium ionic liquids with different anions bromide

@highlight Gas separation performance of PVC IL blends membranes was investigated.
@highlight The selectivity of PVC IL blend membranes increases with increasing feed pressure.
@highlight The selectivity of PVCIL blend membranes decreases by the increasing temperature.
@highlight The PVC BMPyr SCN blend membrane perform better than other membranes.
