 Polylactic acid poly based blend films at variable compositions and fixed weight percentage of Epoxy functionalized styrene acrylate were prepared using a single step blending process followed by blown film extrusion process . The morphological studies revealed proper interaction between polymers by the interaction of chain extender subsequently improved the mechanical properties of the prepared blown films . Similarly the blend films showed a decrease in oxygen transmission rate and water vapor transmission rate in the order of 60 and 14 as compared with VPLA film . The optical and antislip properties of the blend films also increased considerably . The thermal analysis of the blend films depicted marginal enhancement in the stability of PLA along with heterogeneous nucleation effect in PLA matrix due to the presence of ESA and PBSA .

@highlight The reactive blend films of PLA PBS ESA can be utilized in various packaging applications owing to its good mechanical barrier and optical properties.
@highlight The film formation was accomplished using melt blending in a twin screw extruder followed by extrusion blown film process.
@highlight Several characterization techniques were employed to evaluate the potential of blown films pertaining to flexible packaging applications.
