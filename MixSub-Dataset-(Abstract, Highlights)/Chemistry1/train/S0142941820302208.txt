 Fire performances of typical unvulcanized rubbers are investigated and the properties of rubbers and their flowing melts are characterized . If the horizontal melt flow is allowed the burning area increases by 75 473 and proportionally the peak mass loss rate promotes by 55 300 . When the rubber converts to its flowing melt the viscosity and heat of complete combustion reduce and the total crosslink density increases which might be ascribed to the curing the curing reversion and the decomposition mechanism . Except for acrylonitrile butadiene rubber both the T
