 A deeper understanding of the nanoscale and mesoscale structure of chromatographic adsorbents and the distribution of proteins within the media is critical to a mechanistic understanding of separation processes using these materials . Characterisation of the media s architecture at this scale and protein adsorption within is challenging using conventional techniques . In this study we propose a novel resin characterisation technique that enables
