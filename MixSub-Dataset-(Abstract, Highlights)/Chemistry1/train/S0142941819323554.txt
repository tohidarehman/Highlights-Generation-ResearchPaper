 The resiliency of advanced laminated nanocomposite materials to mitigate impact load is an essential characteristic for material selection and product design . This paper investigates the effect of nanofillers and its effect on the damage resistance performance of a newly developed woven Kevlar fabric . Three types of nanofillers were investigated Silicon carbide aluminum oxide Al

@highlight The effect of different nanofiller on the damage resistance of Kevlar KM2plus epoxy nanocomposite was investigated.
@highlight Silicon carbide SiC aluminum oxide Al
@highlight  and multiwalled carbon nanotube MWCNT were used as nanofillers.
@highlight Flexural drop weight SEM and X ray tests were performed to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the nanocomposites.
@highlight The optimum nanofiller content is 0.5wt MWCNTs.
