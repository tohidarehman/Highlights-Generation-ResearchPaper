 The Al doped mesoporous crystalline material 41 composite was prepared and applied as fiber coating material of headspace solid phase microextraction for extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from human urine . Five PAHs including acenaphthene fluorene phenanthrene anthracene and pyrene are chosen as target analytes to evaluate the performance of the material by GC FID analysis . The mesoporous Al MCM 41 composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy X ray diffraction Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nitrogen adsorption desorption measurement and thermogravimetric analysis . The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of HS SPME were investigated . Under the optimal conditions the method exhibits ideal linearity for target analytes in the range of 0.3600 ngmL
