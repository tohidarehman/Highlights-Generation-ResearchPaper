 Syringe filters are used to separate solids from liquids prior to analysis of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances . This is a critical step in sample preparation as losses of PFASs to the filter material can be significant and lead to underestimation . This study evaluated losses of 21 PFASs in three different matrices methanol MilliQ water and water containing 10mgL

@highlight Losses of 21 PFASs to five filtration materials were analyzed in three important matrices.
@highlight PFAS losses to filters could significantly reduce the analytical performance.
@highlight The largest PFAS losses were observed in MilliQ water and the least in methanol.
@highlight In the water matrices losses to filters were larger for longer chained PFASs.
@highlight Recycled cellulose and polyethersulfone filters were found to sorb the least PFASs.
