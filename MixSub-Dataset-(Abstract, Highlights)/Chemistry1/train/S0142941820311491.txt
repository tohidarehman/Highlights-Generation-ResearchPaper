 Chlorinated nitrile rubber has been blended with chlorinated ethylene propylene diene rubber in different ratios by a conventional mill mixing method . The effect of the blend ratio on processing characteristics mechanical properties structure morphology glass transition temperature T

@highlight Novel Cl NBR Cl EPDM blends were prepared by a simple two roll mixing.
@highlight Excellent enhancement in mechanical properties.
@highlight Single glass transition temperature confirms the miscibility of rubber blends.
@highlight Flame retardancy thermal stability and oil resistance of the rubber blends were greatly enhanced.
@highlight Transport of petroleum solvents with Cl NBR Cl EPDM blends were also evaluated.
