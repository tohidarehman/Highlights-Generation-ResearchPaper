 Incorporation of carbon atoms in the Si surface is investigated by using scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations . C atoms are supplied through thermal dissociation of CO molecules adsorbed on the Si surface . One C atom can be incorporated substitutionally below the Si adatoms of the structure . However the stable surface can accommodate only a very small amount of C atoms and the surplus C atoms are swept away to the step edges in the form of silicon carbon clusters restoring the clean Si structure on the flat terrace . In contrast to the B induced
