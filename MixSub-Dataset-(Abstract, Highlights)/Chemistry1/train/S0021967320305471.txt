 Fluorous affinity means remarkably specific interaction between highly organic fluorides . This work aims to explore the potential of fluoro functionalized stationary phase for the separation of organic fluorides by means of fluorous fluorous interaction . Here by using the Michael addition strategy between 1H 1H 2H 2H perfluorodecanethiol and polydopamine a novel fluoro functionalized stationary phase was synthesized for open tubular capillary electrochromatography . The
