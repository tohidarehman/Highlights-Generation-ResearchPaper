 More and more various chemical media are being applied in enantioseparation among them ionic liquids have attracted the long term attention in this decade as green designable solvents . This paper provides comprehensive overview for the applications of ILs in chiral extraction gas chromatography liquid chromatography capillary electrophoresis and other techniques for enantioseparation . Additionally the important resolution mechanisms based on ILs have also been summarized and discussed . This review focuses on the latest development of enantioseparation methods by using ILs in various modes leading to meaningful and valuable information to related fields and thus promotes further research and application of reported methods .

@highlight It is the first review only for ILs in all round enantioseparation ways.
@highlight Comprehensive literature summary and analysis are carried out in this review.
@highlight Resolution mechanisms existing problems suggestions and forecast were summarized.
