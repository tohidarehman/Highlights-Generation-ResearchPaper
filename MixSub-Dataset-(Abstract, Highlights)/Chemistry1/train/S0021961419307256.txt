 To understand the nucleation mechanism and formation process of CP hydrate cage the structure and stability of CP hydrate cage the effect of CP molecule on gas molecules adsorption were studied by the method of

@highlight The cage precursor is CP adsorption onto the hexagonal water face.
@highlight The stabilization energy of CP is higher than that of THF.
@highlight The water water interactions mostly dominate the formation of cages.
@highlight Gas molecules are likely to adsorb on the pentagonal faces of cages.
