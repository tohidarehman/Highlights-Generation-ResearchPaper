 In this study a new automated magnetic micro solid phase extraction was introduced . A Tygon tube was folded and fixed around the pole of a cylindrical magnet . Nanosized magnetic sorbents modified with diphenyldichlorosilane were uniformly immobilized on one side of the inner wall of the tube . Sample solution and desorption solvent were passed through the tube using a peristaltic pump . Four phenylurea herbicides were used as the model compounds to evaluate the method performance . HPLC UV was used to separate and quantify the analytes . The effective parameters influencing the performance of the extraction process were investigated . The limit of detection was 0.04g

@highlight A new automated MSPE method was introduced.
@highlight Sorbent was placed inside of a tube located near the pole of a cylindrical magnet.
@highlight No frit was used for immobilization of sorbent inside of the extraction tube.
@highlight The MSPE method was applied for the determination of phenylurea herbicides.
@highlight The method was applicable for environmental water samples analysis.
