 Stretched polyolefin films and tapes are used in many packaging applications such as BigBags . Stretching is elongation of polymer tapes in one direction resulting in improved mechanical properties . Both amorphous and crystalline polymers are in principle stretchable but linear unbranched macromolecules are highly stretchable . Hence the stretchability of e.g . branched low density polyethylene is lower than of high density polyethylene . Basic requirements for stretching of thermoplastics are known but correlations between material parameters and stretching behaviour are scarce . Moreover stretching of polymers is usually studied with tensile tests at stretching velocities much lower than in industrial processes while results from high velocity stretching tests or on production machines have not been published as of yet . We investigated high velocity stretching of PE LD PE HD and isotactic polypropylene films and tapes and which stretching parameters resulted in maximum mechanical properties . It was found that sample geometry temperature and the degree of stretching have a significant influence on the properties of stretched tapes e.g . higher stretching temperature resulted in higher mechanical properties and orientation of crystallites . Furthermore about 80 of the maximum stretching degree resulted in maximum mechanical properties .
