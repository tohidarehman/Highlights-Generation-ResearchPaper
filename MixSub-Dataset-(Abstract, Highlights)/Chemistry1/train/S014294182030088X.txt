 The mechanical strength of polymer scaffold is closely related to its crystallinity . In this work cellulose nanocrystals were incorporated into poly

@highlight An interconnected porous PLLA CNC 
@highlight scaffold was fabricated via SLS.
@highlight The CNC as biobased nucleation agents significantly enhanced the crystallization behavior of scaffolds.
@highlight The CNC reinforced mechanical properties of PLLA scaffolds.
@highlight The CNC improved the hydrophilicity and degradability of PLLA scaffolds.
@highlight The PLLA CNC 3 scaffold exhibited well cytocompatibility.
