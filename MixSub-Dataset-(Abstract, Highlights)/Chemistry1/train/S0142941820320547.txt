 While an increasing requirement from both fundamental and application a direct tensile testing of freestanding polymer thin films in the air remains a challenge mainly due to their extreme fragility . This study aims to establish a facile and reliable testing system and investigate the effect of specimen geometry on the testing . First a thin film transfer and adhesive guide frame gripping technique is introduced . With low length to width ratio specimens tensile testing of rectangle non standard polystyrene films with thickness down to 45nm is achieved on a commercial universal testing machine . By changing specimen width and gauge length individually a scale law between system compliance and specimen width is then verified . After corrected by compliance a constant modulus of 3.15GPa for 454319nm thick polystyrene films can be obtained . This study provides a potential strategy to overcome operational difficulties in performing tensile testing of freestanding polymer thin films .
