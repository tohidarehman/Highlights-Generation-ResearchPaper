 The deformation of piezoelectric composite has many deadly effects on the transducers and the sonar systems but the relative testing method never been focused . Here we developed a novel fiber grating sensing method for the study of temperature deformation of the piezoelectric composites for the first time . With the increase of temperature the deformations of the piezoelectric composite in three dimensions increased and the increasing speeds were 1.410

@highlight It is one first work on 3D distributed network test method.
@highlight Precise and consistent test at any direction.
@highlight Test with one single fiber.
@highlight Only one channel needed.
