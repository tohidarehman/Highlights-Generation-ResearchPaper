 Cyanoacetylene the simplest cyanopolyyne is an abundant interstellar molecule commonly observed in a vast variety of astronomical sources . Despite its importance as a potential tracer of the evolution of star forming processes the deuterated form of cyanoacetylene is less observed and less studied in the laboratory than the main isotopologue . Here we report the most extensive spectroscopic characterization of DC

@highlight Combined rotational and ro vibrational analysis of DC
@highlight High resolution infrared spectra.
@highlight Rotational spectra in 14 vibrational excited states.
@highlight Anharmonic resonances network.
@highlight Line catalog for astronomical applications.
