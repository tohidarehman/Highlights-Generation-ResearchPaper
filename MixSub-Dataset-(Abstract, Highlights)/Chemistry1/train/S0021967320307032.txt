 The physicochemical properties of small molecules that can be determined by retention measurements in reversed phase liquid chromatography include solvent based properties inferred from equilibrium processes occurring predominantly in the mobile phase and sorption properties for materials which can be used as stationary phases inferred from solute stationary phase interactions . In addition physicochemical properties can be estimated from correlation models based on surrogate chromatographic systems with a similar capability for intermolecular interactions to the chemical or biological system . Examples of properties determined by direct methods include molecular descriptors acid dissociation constants formation constants and surface properties of solids determined by inverse liquid chromatography . Examples of properties estimated by indirect methods include hydrophobicity lipophilicity n octanol water partition constant soil water sorption constant non specific toxicity to fish and microorganisms and permeation coefficients for the blood brain and skin water barriers . Since all approaches depend on an accurate measurement of chromatographic retention parameters typical operational and mechanistic problems are discussed from the perspective of data quality . Fundamentally the accuracy of direct methods is limited by stationary phase heterogeneity and indirect methods by the limited number of suitable surrogate chromatographic models .
