 In this study the self healing ability of the E glass fibers epoxy composites based on microvascular channels under flexural and tensile loading was investigated by a three part healant . The fabrication of the microvascular channels was conducted through embedding the solid preforms and removing them . The epoxy resin and premix anhydride hardener CuBr

@highlight The self healing composites with microvascular system were fabricated.
@highlight The epoxy anhydride hardener and CuBr2 2 Methylimidazole were three part healant.
@highlight The 4vol healant had the maximum recovered tensile strength.
@highlight The 3.7vol healant had the maximum recovered flexural strength.
@highlight The composites had the proper healing efficiency after 7 days.
