 The limited availability of accurate experimental data in wide ranges of pressure temperature and composition is the main constraining factor for the proper development and assessment of thermodynamic models and equations of state . In the particular case of carbon capture and storage processes there is a clear need for data sets related to the mixtures that this work aims to address . This work provides new experimental
