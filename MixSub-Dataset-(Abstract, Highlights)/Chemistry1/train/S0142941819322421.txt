 UV curable organic inorganic blends have captured lots of attention recently due to leveraging the positive features of polymer blending and radiation curing . However the optical properties of such blends including transparency which is an important attribute in many applications have not been sufficiently explored . In this study a series of UV Curable acrylate siloxanes blends were prepared using different compositions and processing variables to obtain blends with promising transparency and acceptable stability before and after curing . The variables include speed and time of mixing siloxane functionality OH versus CH

@highlight A series of UV Curable acrylate siloxanes blends were prepared using different compositions and processing variables.
@highlight A two phase droplet in matrix morphology was formed containing dispersed siloxane particles in an acrylate matrix.
@highlight Incorporation of 10wt compatibilizer reduced the average particle size of the dispersed phase from 600nm to 200nm.
@highlight The above mentioned reduction in particle size resulted in improved transparency.
@highlight Addition of siloxane decreased the heat of reaction and C
@highlight C conversion while increased the roughness and refractive index.
@highlight The developed blends showed promising stability and transparency and thus could be used as a potential platform for PDLCs.
