 The isobaric vapourliquid equilibrium data for the binary system of cyclohexanol cyclohexylbenzene were determined at kPa with a dynamic recirculating apparatus and the temperature ranged from 358.10K to 456.43K and the thermodynamic consistency of the experimental data was checked by the Herington area method and Van Ness method . Afterwards the experimental data was correlated with NRTL Wilson and UNIQUAC model and the corresponding interaction of thermodynamic models of the binary system parameters were obtained through the Aspen software . The results indicated that all three models represent the experimental values quite well while the NRTL model provided a slightly better result than Wilson model and UNIQUAC model . The maximum root mean square deviation of the temperature and vapour phase mole fraction for the NRTL model was less than 0.4K and 0.004 respectively .
