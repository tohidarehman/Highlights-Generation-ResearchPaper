 Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography is a technique for retaining polar analytes that uses polar stationary phases and acetonitrile rich mobile phases . While this technique has several advantages over reversed phase liquid chromatography one main drawback is the reported need for longer column equilibration . The reason for this is not fully understood and is a topic of current investigation . In order to better understand and reduce the equilibration needs accurate characterization of column equilibration under varying conditions is required . The current method of characterizing HILIC column equilibration produces limited data points per test or low time resolution and is highly dependent on the column and probe compounds being used . There is a need for an improved method for characterizing HILIC column equilibration especially if trends across stationary phases are to be observed . In this work MISER or Multiple Injections in a Single Experimental Run is evaluated as a possible tool for characterizing HILIC column equilibration . MISER improves time resolution by allowing for replicate injections without interruption of data collection enabling a more thorough evaluation of column equilibration compared to traditional techniques . Experimental results gathered using MISER show that equilibration of a BEH Amide column is notably shorter when equilibrating from acetonitrile to mobile phases containing higher percentages of water . Column equilibration to a 10 aqueous mobile phase was found to be approximately 5 fold faster than equilibration to a 3 aqueous mobile phase .
