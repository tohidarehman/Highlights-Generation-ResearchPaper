 Black carbon enters soil via deposition of emissions and nowadays also via application of biochar . Recent studies indicate that a yet not quantified part of BC is lost from soil by leaching which implies that BC exists in water transportable form . We aim at quantifying the amount of WEBC in soil and at elucidating whether it relates to biochar application . The composition of WEBC was further tested to evaluate the degree of BC weathering over time after application hypothesizing that BC degrades into smaller polyaromatic units . We analysed total BC and WEBC in topsoil of a field trial with application of 0 4.5 and 9Mg biochar ha

@highlight A biochar application experiment was analyzed for leachable black carbon BC .
@highlight Leachable BC made up 0.6 to 1.84 of total soil BC.
@highlight Biochar application lead to significant higher leachable BC concentrations.
@highlight Proportions of leachable BC to bulk BC decreased with increasing BC application.
@highlight Leachable BC composition differed from that of bulk BC indicating decondensation.
