 A green sample preparation method based on aqueous extraction followed by dispersive solid phase extraction with in situ derivatization was developed for the determination of aflatoxins in traditional Chinese medicines . AFs in TCMs were extracted by alkaline aqueous solution and converted to substituted coumaric acids . Then mixed mode anion exchange sorbent was used to isolate and enrich the substituted coumaric acids . During the elution by acetonitrile trifluoroacetic acid solution AFs were reconstructed and in situ derivatized . Several parameters affecting the procedure were evaluated . The developed preparation method coupled with high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection was successfully applied for AFs determination in TCMs . The limit of detection reached 10pg mL for AFs . Good linearity was obtained in three orders of magnitude with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9996 to 0.9999 . The relative recoveries of the method were between 72.7 and 114.5 with intra and inter day relative standard deviations less than 9.5 and 10.1 respectively . The method was successfully applied to determine AFs in 15 kinds of TCMs in China with the results verified by IAC standard method .
