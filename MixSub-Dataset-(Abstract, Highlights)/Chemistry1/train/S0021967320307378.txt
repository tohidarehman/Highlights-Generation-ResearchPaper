 In this work high performance thin layer chromatography coupled with multivariate image analysis is proposed as a fast and reliable tool for authentication and adulteration detection of Iranian saffron samples based on their HPTLC fingerprints . At first the secondary metabolites of saffron were extracted using ultrasonic assisted solvent extraction which was optimized using central composite design . Next the RGB coordinates of HPTLC images were used for estimation of saffron origin based on principal component analysis . The PCA scores plot showed that saffron samples were clustered into two clear cut groups which was 92 matched with the geographical origins of the samples . In the next step common plant derived adulterants of saffron including safflower saffron style calendula and rubia were investigated with MIA analysis of HPTLC images using partial least squares discriminant analysis at 535 levels . The PLS DA results showed proper classification of saffron and adulterants with sensitivity 99.14 specificity 96.94 error rate 1.96 and accuracy 98.04 . Also the effect of HPTLC injection volume on the performance of the proposed strategy was evaluated . The ability of the proposed method was then investigated by analyzing two additional sample sets including mixed samples of four plant derived adulterants and adulterated commercial samples . Sensitivity and specificity of this model were 100 which confirmed its validity .
