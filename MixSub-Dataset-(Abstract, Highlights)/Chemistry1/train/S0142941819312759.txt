 For energy scavenging applications estimating fatigue life of dielectric elastomer is as crucial as computing the amount of scavenged energy . Crack growth approach well known in rubber industry is a fast methodology to estimate fatigue life . We adapt this methodology to dielectric silicone elastomers and we focus in particular on the factors influencing this estimation such as sample geometry tearing energy power law . We underline that the variation in tearing energy estimation induces a small dispersion on the fatigue life estimation whereas power law identification is the crucial and critical parameter . Finally we define an index of performance based on fatigue life and scavenged energy density and we compare two materials .

@highlight Our results clearly underline that the crack growth approach could be used for dielectric elastomer DE . In the field of dielectric elastomers and more generally in the field of electroactive polymers EAP our paper is only the second one using this method to measure the mechanical fatigue life. The first one estimated the fatigue life of a pre cut dielectric elastomer. Our paper computes the fatigue life of dielectric elastomer in general i.e. without pre cut .
@highlight The power law in the crack growth approach has a huge impact and must be determined carefully. Taking the parameters from others materials lead to under or over estimation of the fatigue life. We adapt a simple methodology to determine the power law of a material.
@highlight Tearing energy is not a value but a range leading to a range for the estimation of the fatigue life.
@highlight Median value of the tearing energy could be used in order to compute the fatigue life.
@highlight Formulas to estimate fatigue life in pure shear configuration seems to lead to wrong or wacky values. Formulas in edge configuration appears better.
@highlight We define an index of performances in order to compare various polymer used for energy scavenging applications.
