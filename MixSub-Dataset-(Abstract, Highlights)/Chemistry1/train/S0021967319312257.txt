 In this present work a novel polyaniline functionalized melamine sponge was successfully prepared using a simple unstirred in situ polymerization process . The PMs was characterized using a scanning electron microscope and contact angle measurements . Its adsorption performance was initially determined via dye adsorption assays and the conditions affecting the synthesis including polymerization time acidity molar ratio and number and sizes of raw melamine sponge were optimized . The PMs was then used as an efficient adsorbent for the development of a novel low cost method for the detection of two representative perfluorinated chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate using ultra performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with the internal standard method . To achieve the best extraction efficiency with this method several variables were optimized including adsorption time pH value the number of PMs and desorption conditions . Calibration graphs showed a good linear degree at concentration ranging from 0.1 to 50gL
