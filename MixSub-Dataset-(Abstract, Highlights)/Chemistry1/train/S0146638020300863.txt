 The maximum burial depth and thermal maturity of a hydrocarbon source rock controls the generation of petroleum and data on rock maturity are necessary for an understanding of a petroleum system . Rock Eval pyrolysis is an established method to assess the hydrocarbon generation potential the type of organic matter but also the thermal maturity of hydrocarbon source rocks . Data on the thermal maturity of source rocks and or of the generated hydrocarbons are however often lacking either because the source rock itself is not available or todays maturities can not be directly linked to a generated petroleum because petroleum generation and expulsion may have taken place at an earlier and less mature stage of the source rock . Indirect records of source rock maturities can be inferred from the physical properties of petroleum from biomarker abundances or from individual hydrocarbon ratios . Using an adapted direct Rock Eval pyrolysis approach for petroleum samples we present data from oils from the BGR petroleum archive . We distinguish between two hydrocarbon release stages during Rock Eval pyrolysis of which the first represents a vaporizable mid molecular S1

@highlight Rock Eval was adapted for pyrolysis of oil.
@highlight Oil composition index OCI defined from oil pyrograms.
@highlight OCI increases with increasing thermal maturity.
@highlight Unless affected by biodegradation and migration maturity mainly controls OCI.
@highlight Case study demonstrates that OCI holds information on kerogen type.
