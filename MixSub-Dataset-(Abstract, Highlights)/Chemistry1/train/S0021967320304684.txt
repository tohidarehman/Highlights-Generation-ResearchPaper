 Deep eutectic solvents were used as an extractant for the determination of pyrethroidsin environmental water and tea beverage samples . Three different acids were chosen as hydrogen bond donors for preparation of DESs and decanoic acid was optimal because of its high recovery . Factors affecting relative recovery were optimized individually including salt addition surfactant addition extraction temperature DES amount and sample volume etc . Under the optimized experimental conditions the relative recovery of pyrethroids was from 89.3 to 97.7 with relative standard deviation values ranging from 1.75 to 2.73 . The linearcorrelationcoefficient ranged from 0.9981 to 0.9992 and the linear range was between 1.9 and 500 g L. Based on a signal to noise ratio of 3 1 the limit of detection values were 0.56 to 1.24 g L. The enrichment factor ranged from 92 to 105 . In conclusion good extraction efficiency was achieved in tea beverage samples under the optimized conditions .
