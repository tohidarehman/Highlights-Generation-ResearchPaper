 The present paper is the continuation of the systematic investigation of the hyperfine structure of atomic Niobium presented in Part I of this work . Just like in Part I spectral lines in the wavelength region between 5540 and 6570 were investigated by laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy . From altogether about 380 transitions about 190 are treated in this part . Here we report on transitions between lower even parity levels between 13 515 and 23 048cm

@highlight Systematic investigation of the hyperfine structure constants of Nb I levels.
@highlight Discovery of two new levels 21 182.31cm
@highlight  even parity 
@highlight  5 2 and 39 834.88cm
@highlight  odd parity 
@highlight  13 2.
@highlight All hf constants for even parity levels between 11 044 and 23 048cm 1 are given 23 of them new determined with lower uncertainty.
@highlight All hf constants for odd parity levels between 31 056 and 42 000cm 1 are given most of them new determined with lower uncertainty.
@highlight For ca. 50 levels the hf constants are given for the first time.
@highlight Saturation effects are taken into account when hf constants are determined from experimental recordings.
