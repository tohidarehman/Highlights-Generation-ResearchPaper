 A carbon fiber core and glass fiber shell hybrid rod with the diameter of 22mm was developed to replace the steel rod in the application of underground oil extraction . In the present study the variation in the properties of the hybrid rod served for 553 days was investigated subjected to the coupling conditions of elevated temperature hydraulic pressure and fatigue load stress level peak one exposure condition closed to the ground T 25C P 0.5MPa L

@highlight A new test method was adopted to investigate the long term evolution of the carbon glass fiber hybrid rod.
@highlight Exposed in the deep oil well condition led to an extra degradation of interface shear strength compared to ground exposure.
@highlight The removal of free and bound water from the hybrid rod brought about an average increase percentage of ISS.
@highlight The degradation mechanism of ISS was attributed to the hydrolysis and plasticization of resin owing to the hydrogen bonds.
@highlight The applied maximum fatigue load was obtained to be 114.3 kN with the fatigue life of 22.6 years for the present hybrid rod.
