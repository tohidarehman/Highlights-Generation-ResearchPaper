 In recent decades the basic technology of pressure sensitive adhesive acrylics has developed into a sophisticated science . The main properties of acrylic PSAs such as tack peel adhesion and shear strength are determined to a large extent by the kind and quantity of crosslinking agents added to the synthesized PSAs . In order to improve their adhesive and cohesive properties a wide range of amino resin thermal crosslinkers are tested . An acrylic PSA based on 2 ethylhexylacrylate n butyl acrylate and acrylic acid was synthesized by performing a radical polymerization in ethyl acetate . After the addition of amino resins to the acrylic PSA and carrying out thermally initiated crosslinking processes to prepare one sided self adhesive tapes their properties were assessed .

@highlight The type and amount of crosslinking agent has a significant impact on the properties of the pressure sensitive adhesives.
@highlight Selected amino resins were evaluated as thermal reactive crosslinking agents for acrylic pressure sensitive adhesives.
@highlight A wide range of amino resins was tested from the group of derivatives of melamine benzoguanamine glycoluril and urea.
@highlight Samples of crosslinked PSAs were evaluated to determine their properties such as tack peel adhesion and shear strength.
@highlight Optimal balance between mentioned properties has been achieved for one benzoguanamine resin and for two melamine resins.
