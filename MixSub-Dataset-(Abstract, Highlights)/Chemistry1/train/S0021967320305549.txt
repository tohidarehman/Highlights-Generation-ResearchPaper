 The monodisperse pillararene based polymeric sub microsphere was prepared by polycondensation of hydroxylated pillararene and cyanuric chloride through a one pot reaction in mild condition . The preparation was realized by a simple two step temperature programmed process without heating operation . The obtained polymeric sub microsphere exhibited monodisperse and regular spherical structure with uniform particle size distribution of 220320nm accounting for 94 . The prominent adsorption capacity of the polymeric sub microsphere for antioxidants was demonstrated and attributed to the synergistic effect of the cladding interaction with the electron rich cavity and hydrophilic interaction with terminal hydroxyl on pillararene . Then the pillararene sub microsphere was packed into a micro column to realize effective on line enrichment of antioxidants coupling with high performance liquid chromatography . The flow rate of extraction and desorption solvent clean up and desorption volume were assessed to optimize the method . The method showed wide linear ranges with
