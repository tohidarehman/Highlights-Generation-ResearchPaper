 Liquid liquid partition chromatography has been used for many years as a model and teaching introduction to column chromatography . However the partition model does not describe separations on bonded phases with porous supports particularly well especially regarding the thermodynamics controlling solute distribution . Further difficulties arise when more than one mechanism is involved in solute retention . Nomenclature is not perfectly aligned with the underlying thermodynamic descriptors and is inconsistently applied over various chromatographic techniques . Presented here is a general description of retention that spans partition size exclusion and hydrodynamic separation processes and is then applied to bonded phase separations on porous supports . The model provides a general description applicable to adsorption reversed phase hydrophilic interaction size exclusion hydrodynamic chromatography and any combination of these techniques including liquid chromatography at the critical condition . Further expansion to include retention by ion exchange and field flow fractionation appears to be possible . Recommendations on retention factor definition and evaluation are given .

@highlight A general retention model spanning multiple techniques is derived.
@highlight Retention and thermodynamics are aligned and rationalized.
@highlight Retention mechanisms are accounted individually or in combination.
@highlight Retention factor is defined uniformly for all chromatography techniques.
