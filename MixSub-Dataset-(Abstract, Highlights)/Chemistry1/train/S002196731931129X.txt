 In recent years supercritical fluid chromatography has become a powerful tool in modern analytical chemistry and the diversity of stationary phases in SFC promotes phenyl type phases to confront with a significant resurgence of interest . In this paper a series of phenyl type stationary phases with different substituted benzenes involving N propylbenzamide 4 fluoro N propylbenzamide and 4 ethyl N propylbenzamide were synthesized . Retention mechanism of these phases in SFC was investigated using a linear solvation energy relationship model . The phenyl type stationary phases with all positive parameters can provide all types of interaction typically involving hydrogen bonding dipole dipole and dispersive interactions . The different benzene s substituents of the stationary phases mainly affected their hydrogen bonding and dipole dipole interactions which could be reflected by the angle between the solvation vectors to some extent .
