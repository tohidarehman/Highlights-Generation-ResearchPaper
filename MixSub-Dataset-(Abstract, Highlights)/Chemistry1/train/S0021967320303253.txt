 The coexistence of the anilinopyrimidine fungicides pyrimethanil and cyprodinil and suspected metabolites in wine samples was investigated by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry based on triple quadrupole and quadrupole time of flight MS instruments . For the first time quantitative data obtained after solid phase extraction of wine samples have demonstrated the systematic presence of 4 hydroxyanilino derivatives of PYR and CYP in wines containing residues of parent fungicides at concentrations from 0.2 to 58ngmL

@highlight 4 hydroxyanilino metabolites of cyprodinil and pyrimethanil quantified in wine.
@highlight Higher levels of 4 hydroxyanilino pyrimethanil than active fungicide in red wine.
@highlight Additional hydroxylated metabolites identified from their accurate MS spectra.
@highlight Hydroxylated metabolites coexist as free and glycosylated forms.
