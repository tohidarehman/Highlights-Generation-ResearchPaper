 This study focuses on the health benefits of several fresh herbs that are commonly used in the Mediterranean diet . Antioxidant activity phytosterol content and amylase inhibitory activity of fresh basil lavender oregano rosemary sage and thyme are analyzed and compared . High performance thin layer chromatography combined with effect directed analysis was used to detect and quantify biological active compounds on chromatograms . The highest antioxidant activity was measured in the extract from oregano leaf while the highest terpenoid content was in basil leaf extract . All extracts except lavender leaf and lavender flower extracts showed amylase inhibition . The same compound at

@highlight Culinary herbs exhibit antioxidant activity amylase inhibition and provide neuroprotection.
@highlight Pentacyclic triterpenes are amylase inhibitors with neuroprotective potential.
@highlight HPTLC EDA combined with ATR FTIR enables bioassay guided identification of active compounds.
