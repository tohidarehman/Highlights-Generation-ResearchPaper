 It is challenging to greatly increase of the extraction selectivity and efficiency by stir bar sorptive extraction of ultra trace polychlorinated biphenyls in complex environmental matrix e.g . soils . To fulfill this purpose one of the critical works is to prepare some coatings with high selectivity adsorptive capacity and reusability . It is also important to develop some green simple methods for preperation the coatings . In this work a kind of highly efficient and bioactive coating based on hyperbranched aptamer was constructed

@highlight A hyperbranched aptamer coating was constructed on a magnetic stir bar with ease.
@highlight The bioactive coating shows high adsorption capacity and specificity towards PCBs.
@highlight The stir bar was used to headspace extract and detect ngg
@highlight of PCBs in soils.
@highlight The assay is facile green and effective to detect trace PCBs in complex samples.
