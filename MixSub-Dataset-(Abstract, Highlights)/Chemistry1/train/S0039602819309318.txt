 Water dissociation is an indispensable step in industrial as well as in natural processes . It is the rate determining step in the industrially important water gas shift reaction . The barrier for the dissociation of H

@highlight The rate determining step H
@highlight O dissociation in water gas shift reaction is catalyzed by highly efficient Ag Ni bimetallic alloy surface catalyst.
@highlight Gradual addition of Ni atoms on Ag 111 surface increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy barrier.
@highlight A perfect composition of Ag Ni alloy results in the significant lowering of the activation energy barrier to the H
@highlight O dissociation.
