 In this paper volumetric ultrasonic and viscometric analysis of thiamine hydrochloride in aqueous and mixed aqueous solutions of saccharides such as 0.1molkg

@highlight The physical parameters like density speed of sound and viscosity of ternary systems are investigated.
@highlight The systems used are thiamine hydrochloride in aqueous solutions of various saccharides.
@highlight Thermodynamic compressibility and transport properties are evaluated for the systems under study.
@highlight The results are discussed in terms of ionic hydrophilic and hydrophilic hydrophilic interactions.
@highlight The solute behaves as structure breaker in the ternary systems.
