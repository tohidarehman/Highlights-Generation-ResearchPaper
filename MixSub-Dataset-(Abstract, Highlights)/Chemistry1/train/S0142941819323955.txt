 This research is focused to fundamentally understand the benefits of using Agave Americana C. plant as potential reinforcement in polymeric composites . The fibers were extracted from the external part of the bark of the plant which grows worldwide in pastures grasslands open woodlands coastal and riparian zones . In order to use the natural fiber as reinforcement it is paramount important to probe their chemical composition microstructural behavior and mechanical properties . Hence firstly the extracted fibers were chemically treated with NaOH stearic acid benzoyl peroxide and potassium permanganate . The chemical composition in terms of cellulose hemicellulose lignin and other waxy substances were determined using a standard TAPPI method . FT IR technique was used to understand the character of molecular bonds crystallinity and their correlations with various bonds in fiber structure . The thermal stability was investigated through thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analysis and the mechanical characterization was performed by applying standard tensile test . The surface morphology of fibers was examined through scanning electron microscopy and finally reliability scrutiny of all the analysis was carried out . The results of chemical modification techniques applied on the surfaces of natural fibers allows to produce superior fibers used to form the novel composite materials for light weight application .
