 Four polar stationary phases have been characterized in supercritical fluid chromatography by linear free energy relationships method with an extended set of Abraham s descriptors . Temperature 2555

@highlight Four polar stationary phases have been characterized in SFC by LFER method.
@highlight Temperature and pressure effects on retention of 89 test compounds were studied.
@highlight Temperature and pressure variations lead to small but traceable changes in LFER coefficients.
@highlight The direction and scale of temperature effects depend on stationary phase type.
@highlight Temperature and pressure have moderate effects on selectivity.
