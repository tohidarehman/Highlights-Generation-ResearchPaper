 The elevated strain rate compressive response of closed cell polyvinyl chloride foam at various densities is investigated . Two loading directions were considered to investigate structural anisotropy . The elevated strain rates tests up to 200s

@highlight Intermediate strain rate up to 200s
@highlight  compression tests on PVC foams.
@highlight Strain rate effects observed when loading in the foam rise direction.
@highlight No significant rate effects observed when loading perpendicular to rise direction.
@highlight SEM analysis illustrated plastic hinges are main deformation mechanism.
@highlight Anisotropic behavior accurately predicted using an analytical approach.
