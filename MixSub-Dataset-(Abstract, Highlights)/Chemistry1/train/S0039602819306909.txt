 Surface structures and thermal stability of the ultrathin In films adsorbed on two different and Pb Si surfaces varying in initial reconstructions are investigated

@highlight Lead surfactant strongly influences on the surface structure formation and thermal stability of ultrathin In film on Si 111 surface.
@highlight Annealing the In Si 111 33 Pb system induces migration of the toplayer In atoms beneath the Pb layers resulting in the formation of disordered mixed In Pb overlayer.
@highlight For the In Si 111 33 Pb system annealing induces formation alloyed structures with an ordered array.
@highlight The 11 22 and 41 phases can be created by either pure In or In Pb alloy in dependence on initial ordering of the surface.
@highlight The PbIn bonding is weaker than the InSi one.
