 Two dimensional gel electrophoresis is a technique that has been widely applied in a variety of proteomics studies . It is capable of resolving complex protein mixtures into individual protein spots based on their isoelectric point and molecular weight enabling large scale analysis of protein expression patterns for deciphering their changes in different biological conditions . 2 DE is a powerful tool that empowers researchers to perform differential qualitative and quantitative proteome analysis and is particularly advantageous for characterizing protein isoforms and post translationally modified proteins . Despite its popularity as the workhorse for proteomics in the past few decades it has been gradually displaced by the more sophisticated and high performance mass spectrometry based methods . However there are several variations of the 2 DE technique that have emerged as promising approaches that shine new light on specific niches that 2 DE could still contribute . In this review we first provide an overview of the applications of 2 DE its merits and pitfalls in the current proteomic research arena followed by a discussion on several alternative approaches for potential future applications .
