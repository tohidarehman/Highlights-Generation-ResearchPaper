 The ferrofluid phase was prepared according to mixing magnetic nanoparticle and the hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent as a green microextraction solvent . This new composite was applied for vortex assisted dispersive liquidliquid microextraction of doxycycline residual extraction and determined through high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet . The characterization of magnetic nanoparticle was investigated by XRD TEM and FESEM . The dependency of DOC microextraction to main variables and their interaction and find optimum points were undertaken using response surface methodology with either central composite design . Thus the optimum pH ionic strength ferrofluid volume and vortex time for DOC extraction are determined to be 3.0 4 w v 150L and 7min respectively . According to this condition linear response is found to be greater than 10400ngmL
