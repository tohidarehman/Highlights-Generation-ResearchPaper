 Fiber Metal Laminates is developing very fast with the both features of resin based composite and metal and its property can be improved by mixing nano scale particles as FMLs Nano . Based on the different mixing volume fractions this paper investigated the effect of Graphene Oxide on the mechanical properties of the FMLs with carbon fiber used including tensile flexural and interface shear behaviors . The interface strengthening mechanism of GO as significant filler for enhancing the carbon woven fabric based FMLs was explored . To encourage the application range of FMLs Nano in the fields of aircraft aerospace and automotive etc . to form the complicated components . It was observed that the FMLs with GO has the better tensile performance than the FMLs without GO and the Young s modulus and tensile strength of the FMLs GO are increased by 13.5 and 11.7 respectively . Especially the flexural and interface shear strength can be increased up to 134.0 and 150.4 compared to the pure FMLs and the improvement mechanism was investigated mechanically and observed with scanned micrograph . This paper also provides a fundamental reference for improving the interfacial performance of different layers of FMLs GO by using the normal preparation condition .
