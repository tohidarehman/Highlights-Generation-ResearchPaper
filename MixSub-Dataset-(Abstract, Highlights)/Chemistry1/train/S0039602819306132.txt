 The surface phonon dispersion of a deuterium terminated Si surface is investigated by using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and first principles calculations based on the density functional theory with the local density approximation . The characteristics of D Si are unique compared to those of H Si in terms of the resolved vibrational modes . By the HREELS one dimensional surface phonons consisting of DSi stretching vibrations are observed above the bulk phonon band energy edge of 64.5meV . Ten modes are observed below this value classified as surface surface resonant and bulk phonons according to the calculated energy dispersion as well as the depth profile of spectral density and displacement vectors . In particular five DSi bending modes are observed out of the seven theoretically predicted modes . The bending modes are strongly coupled with the displacements across the D and five Si layers . The DFT LDA surface phonon dispersion is in good agreement with the experimental results except a few frequency dispersion mismatches as the structure optimized by DFT LDA mismatches with the previous scanning tunneling microscopy results . D Si elucidates the nature of covalently bonded phonons and their characteristics both experimentally and theoretically .

@highlight Clean and atomically ordered deuterium terminated Si 110 11 are prepared by the deuterium replacement method for H Si 110 11 .
@highlight The surface phonon dispersion is investigated using HREELS and first principles calculations.
@highlight Due to the isotope effect some bending modes are strongly coupled with the Si substrate.
@highlight The calculated surface phonon dispersion is in good agreement with the experimental results except DSi stretching and bending modes.
@highlight The structural optimization by LDA only relaxes the outermost DSi bond resulting in the disagreement between experiment and theory.
