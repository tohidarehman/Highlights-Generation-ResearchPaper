 The utilization of composite fabric membrane materials for large span membrane structures has attracted considerable attention in recent decades due to enhanced material properties . Biaxial mechanical properties with respect to real engineering applications are essential and indispensable in comparison with uniaxial ones . This study focuses on true biaxial characteristics of a typical polyvinylidene fluoride coated polyester membrane material in terms of stress strain characteristics and breaking criteria .

@highlight Achieve 3D strain surfaces and biaxial stress strain equations.
@highlight Propose a breaking criteria for fabric membrane and determine constants.
@highlight Validate the suitability of new specimens to identify biaxial properties.
