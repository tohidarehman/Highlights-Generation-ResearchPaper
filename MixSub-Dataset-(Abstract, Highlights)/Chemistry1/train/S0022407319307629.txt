 Anthropogenic skyglow dominates views of the natural night sky in most urban settings and the associated emission of artificial light at night into the environment of cities involves a number of known and suspected negative externalities . One approach to lowering consumption of ALAN in cities is dimming or extinguishing publicly owned outdoor lighting during overnight hours however there are few reports in the literature about the efficacy of these programs . Here we report the results of one of the largest municipal lighting dimming experiments to date involving 20 000 roadway luminaires owned and operated by the City of Tucson Arizona U.S. We analyzed both single channel and spatially resolved ground based measurements of broadband night sky radiance obtained during the tests determining that the zenith sky brightness during the tests decreased by

@highlight An experiment was conducted involving the dimming of nearly 20 000 municipally owned street lights in a U.S. city of half a million inhabitants over ten nights in the spring of 2019.
@highlight The signal of the dimming tests was successfully observed in measurements of zenith night sky radiance obtained at various radii from the city center.
