 Coal contains detailed long term records of contemporaneous environment climate and subsequent diagenetic processes . Stable isotopes of carbon petrological palynological and mineralogical analyses were carried out on a 28m thick low rank Miocene coal seam from the Mile Basin Yunnan Province China for the purpose of deciphering the palaeoclimate and sedimentary conditions during peat deposition . The coal is characterized by both pale and dark lithotypes . Palynological analyses show that both lithotypes are dominated by angiosperms which is interpreted to indicate a moderately warm climate . The absence of
