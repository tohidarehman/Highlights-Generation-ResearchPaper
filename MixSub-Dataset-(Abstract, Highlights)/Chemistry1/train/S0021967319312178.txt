 An original multiresidue method based on thermal extraction and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was developed to simultaneously quantify from a very small amount of sample a wide range of concerning SVOCs including polycyclic musks organochlorines organophosphates oxadiazolones polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polybromodiphenylethers polychlorobiphenyls phthalates and pyrethroids in indoor settled dust . Method limits of quantification ranged from 5ng g

@highlight Simultaneous analysis of 44 SVOCs of health concern in indoor settled dust.
@highlight Simple cost effective and environmentally friendly method based on thermal extraction.
@highlight Precise and accurate quantification of a wide range of SVOCs from only 2mg of sieved dust.
@highlight Suitable method for environmental monitoring programs or large scale studies.
