 Biomaterial centered infection is an important cause affecting wound healing and preventing infection can accelerate wound healing and improve patients cooperation . Our objective was to establish a dressings model by sustainably releasing chlorhexidine gluconate to develop an effective method to inhibit wound infection . In this study CHG loaded alginate fibers was fabricated by wet blending spinning technology . The drug entrapment was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy fourier transform infrared spectra differential scanning calorimetry X ray diffraction and optical microscope . The content of chlorhexidine gluconate in fibers was determined by high performance liquid chromatography . Analysis indicated that chlorhexidine gluconate was successfully encapsulated into the alginate fibers and fibrous surface folds and area increases due to the grafting . The thermal stability of co spun fibers was improved with the increasing content of chlorhexidine gluconate . Co spun fibers exhibited better antibacterial activity and stability in comparison with pure alginate fibers indicating that alginate fibers grafted with chlorhexidine gluconate has wider application prospect in the field of biomedical dressings .

@highlight CHG loaded alginate fibers was manufactured by wet blending spinning technology using medical alginate as matrix.
@highlight HPLC method was adopted to determine the content of CHG.
@highlight CHG binding to alginate matrix by hydrogen to improve the hygroscopicity of fibers was confirmed.
@highlight CHG loaded alginate fibers showed excellent antibacterial properties.
@highlight The hygroscopicity of CHG loaded alginate fibers was slightly improved.
