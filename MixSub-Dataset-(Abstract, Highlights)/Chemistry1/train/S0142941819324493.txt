 The aim of this study was to investigate the water vapor adsorption behavior and mechanical properties of poly zeolite composites prepared with triethyl citrate via a melting process . TEC was used to improve the flexibility of the PLA and the dispersibility of the zeolite in TEC zeolite suspensions that were ultra sonicated . It was found that zeolite was uniformly dispersed in the PLA matrix and the interfacial adhesion between the PLA matrix and zeolite was enhanced by TEC . In addition the tensile strengths and Young s modulus of the composites improved with increasing zeolite content . The PLA zeolite composites prepared with TEC had increased water vapor permeability and contact angles compared to neat PLA and standard PLA zeolite due to the presence of TEC . In particular TEC accelerated the hydrolysis of the PLA surface in a high humidity environment resulting in an improvement in water vapor sorption capacity . At the same zeolite content of 15 phr the equilibrium moisture content values of PLA zeolite films prepared with TEC increased by up to 39.25mg g whereas those prepared without TEC only increased by up to 24.33mg g. The results suggest the possibility of applying PLA zeolite films prepared with TEC as a flexible active packaging material .

@highlight TEC could induce uniform dispersion of zeolites in PLA matrix and increase compatibility between filler and polymer.
@highlight PTZ composites demonstrated greatly increase in elongation at break from 8 to 200 .
@highlight PTZ composite showed the quick adsorption of moisture on the surface of the films.
@highlight Furthermore PTZ composite showed an increase in adsorption capacity of up to 4.2 compared to PZ composites.
@highlight Based on these results PTZ film can be applied for an eco friendly adsorption packaging material.
