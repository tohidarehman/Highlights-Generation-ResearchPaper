 This work is dedicated to Stark broadening of singly ionized Molybdenum spectral lines in UV spectrum . We present stark widths of 43 Mo II spectral lines in the wavelength range 275 to 376nm measured at electron density of 1.510

@highlight Stark widths for 43 Mo II spectral lines in NUV region are presented.
@highlight All Stark widths are the first results in Mo II spectrum.
@highlight Experiment is conducted in Laser Induced Plasma.
@highlight Electron density was 1.5e23 m
@highlight electron temperature 13000K.
