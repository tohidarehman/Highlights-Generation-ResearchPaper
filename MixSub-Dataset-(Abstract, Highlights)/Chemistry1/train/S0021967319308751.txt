 The gaseous phase analyses of volatile organic compounds are an important challenge especially when these organics are formed in high vacuum environments 10

@highlight The analytical system designed for VOCs analysis from vacuum environments is herein optimized.
@highlight A cryofocusing system in the GC oven enhanced chromatographic resolution and sensitivity.
@highlight VOCs recovery was noticably improved by increasing system pressure using Argon.
@highlight The optimized system was applied to the analysis of photoprocessed interstellar ice analogs.
