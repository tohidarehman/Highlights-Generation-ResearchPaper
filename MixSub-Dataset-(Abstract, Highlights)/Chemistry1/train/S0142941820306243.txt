 Additive manufacturing offers a useful and accessible tool for prototyping and manufacturing small volume functional parts . Polylactic acid and thermoplastic polyurethane are amongst the most commonly used materials . Characterising 3D printed PLA and TPU is potentially important for both designing and finite element modelling of functional parts . This work explores the mechanical properties of additively manufactured PLA TPU specimens with consideration to design parameters including size and infill percentage . PLA TPU specimens are 3D printed in selected ISO standard geometries with 20 60 100 infill percentage . Tensile and compression test results suggest that traditional ISO testing standards might be insufficient in characterising 3D printed materials for finite element modelling or application purposes . Infill percentage in combination to design size may significantly affect the mechanical performance of 3D printed parts . Dimensional variation may cause inhomogeneity in mechanical properties between large and small cross section areas of the same part . The effect was reduced in small cross section parts where reducing the nominal infill had less effect on the resulting specimens . The results suggest that for 3D printed functional parts with significant dimensional differences between sections the material properties are not necessarily homogeneous . This consideration may be significant for designers using 3D printing for applications which include mechanical loading .
