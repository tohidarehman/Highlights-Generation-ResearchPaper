 The elution behavior of bivalent bispecific antibodies comprising an immunoglobulin G framework genetically fused to a pair of single chain variable fragments was studied on hydrophobic interaction chromatography columns using ammonium sulfate gradients . Each of the BiSAb molecules studied exhibited a three peak elution behavior regardless of the location of scFv attachment to the framework IgG . Collecting and re injecting each of the isolated peaks and eluting with the same gradient resulted in the same three peak profile indicating that the behavior is reversible . Analogous behavior was observed for HIC resins with different functional ligands matrix structures and particle sizes . Residence time operating temperature and hold time were shown to affect the elution behavior . While three peaks were obtained at short residence times and room temperature residence times longer than about 27min or operating at 45C resulted in a single merged peak indicating that the underlying mechanism occurs on time scales comparable to that of chromatographic separation . Holding the protein on the resins prior to elution enriched the late eluting peak indicating that multiple binding states formed on the chromatographic surface are responsible for this behavior . Tryptophan auto fluorescence measurements show that stronger binding forms have increased solvent exposure indicating that surface catalyzed conformational changes play a role . A model was developed to describe the interplay of chromatographic separation and slow conformational changes .
