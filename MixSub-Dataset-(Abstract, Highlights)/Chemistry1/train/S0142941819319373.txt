 Iron acetylacetonate in the presence of triethanolamine was utilized as a novel crosslinking agent for halogenated diene rubber . Following the assumption that the mechanism of the crosslinking bases on the Heck type reaction mechanism which requires the presence of a halogen and an unsaturated carbon carbon double bond chloroprene rubber and brominated butyl rubber were utilized as rubber matrices . The results of FTIR spectra analysis confirm the proposed mechanism and indicate that a Heck type reaction is feasible for performing a crosslinking of halogenated diene rubbers . The use of the Fe TEOA curing system results in a significant torque increase during the vulcanization which confirms the high activity of those compounds . The elimination of halogen from a rubber macromolecular structure or elimination of a basic environment of the crosslinking reaction results in a deactivation of the new curing system .
