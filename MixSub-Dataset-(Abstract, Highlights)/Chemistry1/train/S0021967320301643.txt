 As a novelty the combination of headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap mass analyzer in full scan mode was evaluated for the monitoring of organic pollutants in wastewaters . The developed methodology showed good linearity R

@highlight A novel automated method for screening of organic pollutants was developed.
@highlight The combination of HS SPME with GC Orbitrap MS has been proposed for first time.
@highlight The developed method resulted robust reliable and highly sensitive and selective.
@highlight Target post target and non target analysis of wastewaters detected 54 pollutants.
@highlight The methodology is a breakthrough for the screening of pollutants in water samples.
