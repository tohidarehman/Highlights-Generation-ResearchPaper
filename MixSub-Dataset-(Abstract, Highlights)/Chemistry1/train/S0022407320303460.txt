 Dual view tomographic particle holography combining tomography and holography is a promising approach to yield high accurate 3D measurement of particle field . A standard model of particle hologram has been developed in the framework of generalized Lorenz Mie theory to model and investigate the light scattering effects on three configurations of dual view tomographic particle holography that is dual beam dual view Gabor inline holography single beam dual view combining Gabor inline holography with off axis scattering holography and single beam dual view off axis scattering holography . Dual beam dual view Gabor inline holography is dominated by the traditional Gabor inline hologram but the two light scattering fields bring about small amplitude off axis scattering inline recording hologram negligible self reference hologram and lensless Fourier hologram . The off axis scattering inline recording hologram can produce additional glare points in the reconstructed particle image . The off axis scattering holography reconstructs multiple glare light and generates more than one intersections in the merged 3D reconstructed field in tomographic particle holography leading to possible ghost particle image and implying new algorithm for particle detection to be developed . This model can provide standard hologram to processing algorithm development .
