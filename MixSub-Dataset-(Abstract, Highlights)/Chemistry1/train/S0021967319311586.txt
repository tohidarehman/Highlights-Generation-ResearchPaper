 Supercritical fluid chromatography is an orthogonal technique to UHPLC . In recent years SFC has demonstrated potential for use in the analysis of a broad variety of analytes of different polarities if modifiers and additives are utilized as additional mobile phase constituents . However to date little research has been carried out on ion exchange separation of highly polar and ionic analytes using SFC .

@highlight SFC MS MS for highly polar ionic analytes.
@highlight Ion exchange column as stationary phase.
@highlight Drugs and metabolites for doping control analysis and forensics.
@highlight Systematic method development.
