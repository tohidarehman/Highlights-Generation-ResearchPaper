 The accumulation of organic carbon in the sediments of river dominated continental margins plays a critical role in the global carbon budget and is subject to human modification . However the relationships between human activities in drainage basins and carbon burial in modern sediments are still poorly understood . Here a well preserved sediment core from a mud zone in the East China Sea was analyzed for isotopes

@highlight Human induced river damming and cultivated land changes controlled the export of terrestrial organic carbon to the ocean.
@highlight Marine productivity increased due to increasing nutrient supply following the use of N and P fertilizers.
@highlight Organic carbon burial fluxes were regulated by changes in sedimentation accumulation rates and organic carbon content.
@highlight The construction of the Three Gorges Dam TGD significantly impacted the burial and preservation of organic carbon.
