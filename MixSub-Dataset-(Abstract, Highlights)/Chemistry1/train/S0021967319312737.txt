 Click chemistry has attracted increasing attention for the synthesis of novel stationary phases . Considering the advantage of click chemistry a strategy based on thiol Michael addition was developed for the preparation of a new stationary phase herein and a phenyl vinyl sulfone stationary phase was prepared . The resulting M PVS bonded silica was characterized by elemental analysis solid state

@highlight It is the first time that thiol Michael addition reaction was used for chemical modification on silica particle herein.
@highlight A new phenyl vinyl sulfone stationary phase was synthesized and characterized.
@highlight This stationary phase provided multiple interactions.
