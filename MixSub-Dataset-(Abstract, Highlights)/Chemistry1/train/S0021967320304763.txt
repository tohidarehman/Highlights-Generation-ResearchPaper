 In the present study separation of enantiomers of some chiral neutral basic and weakly acidic analytes was investigated on the chiral stationary phase made by covalent immobilization of amylose tris onto aminopropylsilanized silica in nano liquid chromatography in aqueous methanol or acetonitrile mixtures . It has been shown that similar to high performance liquid chromatography and supercritical fluid chromatography this chiral selector is useful for separation of enantiomers of neutral basic and acidic analytes also in nano LC . In comparison to our previous research in which the chiral selector was bonded on native silica in this study the CS was immobilized on APS silica in order to improve chromatographic performance towards basic analytes . In fact some improvement was observed and surprisingly not only for basic but also for neutral and acidic analytes . Again quite unexpectedly almost no electroosmotic flow was observed in capillaries packed with ca . 20 amylose tris immobilized onto APS silica although the same APS silica before attachment of chiral selector exhibited significant EOF . In order to generate EOF in the capillaries with the CSP and enable capillary electrochromatographic experiment on it the short segment of the capillary column was packed with APS silica without chiral selector . The EOF in such capillary enabled CEC experiment and some preliminary results are reported here .
