 Enantioseparation of lysine derivatives by chiral high performance liquid chromatography was accomplished using two chiral stationary phases based on polysaccharides under normal phase conditions . All analytes were completely separated . The impacts of polar modifiers analyte structure and column temperature on chiral separation were discussed . Moreover the relationship between structure and retention was investigated . The van t Hoff equation was employed to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters of the chiral separation process . The data suggest that the chiral separation process was enthalpy driven . Surprisingly two uncommon phenomena were observed high separation factors on Chiralpak IA and different binding mechanisms with CSP and the two enantiomers .
