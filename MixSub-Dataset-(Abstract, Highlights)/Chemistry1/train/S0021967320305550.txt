 The influence of impregnation the chromatographic plate adsorbent layer silica with hen s egg white albumin or bovine serum albumin on the retention of some popular medicines is investigated . The effect of composition and buffer pH of the mobile phase on solute separation selectivity is also studied . The chromatographic systems with and without above mentioned albumins and their influence on investigated drug retention are compared . In general it has been turned out that retention of tested medicines in systems with the sorbent impregnated with albumin significantly increase relative to those with non impregnated .

@highlight A new method of impregnating the adsorbent layer of a chromatographic plate with hen s egg white albumin or bovine serum albumin.
@highlight Influence of albumin modified adsorbent layer on the retention of different analytes in TLC systems.
@highlight Solvent front position extraction SFPE .
