 In continuation to our prior investigational studies on the interactions between binary mixtures of alkoxy alkanols and alcohols here we report density speed of sound FT IR as well as NMR analysis of 2 ethanol CH

@highlight Binary mixtures of 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol with alcohols have been studied at different temperatures.
@highlight Strong H bonding interactions between the components are confirmed that decreases with increasing chain length of alcohols.
@highlight FT IR and NMR studies strongly corroborate the experimental and computational analysis results.
