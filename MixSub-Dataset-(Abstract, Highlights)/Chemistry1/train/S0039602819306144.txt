 In building up molecular circuits and molecule based devices it is central to determine how molecules interact with the surface . Here we explore the behaviour of a bifunctional molecule i.e . phenol on Si77 by high resolution photoemission comparatively in the C1s Si2p VB and O1s energy ranges . We found out that the adsorption is more complex than originally hypothesized with a mixture of dissociative and molecular adsorbates at low exposures and a preeminence of dissociative adsorbates at higher exposure . The co existence of these states is different from the Si surface where the molecular states are readily converted into dissociative ones .

@highlight The interaction pattern of phenol with Si 111 77 is complex and varies as a function of the exposure.
@highlight Dissociative and molecular adsorptions co exist at different extents depending on the exposure.
@highlight Investigations were carried out by multiple energy ranges photoemission experiments and lineshape analyses.
