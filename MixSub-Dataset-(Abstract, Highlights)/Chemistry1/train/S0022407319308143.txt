 In this study the capabilities of the Dynamic Radiative Transfer System are shown both for expressing the temporal and spatial behavior of photon propagation and most importantly for imaging through optically complex turbid media . A light beam with linear shaped source profile was employed and pulse durations ranging from the continuous down to the ultra fast regime were studied . By further applying simple intensity normalization processing clean images of the embedded objects can be extracted . The pulse evolution through the medium can be traced and displayed in time frame sequence depicting the gradual image formation and fading . It is demonstrated that illumination from scattered photons in the medium is advantageous yielding clean full frame images without need for beam scanning . Additionally image retrieval is significantly enhanced by registering directionally selected photons revealing 3 D objects embedded deeper in the medium . In contrast with the accepted notion that early photons are the sole means for image formation DRTS proves that there exists a capability for image formation using the scattered photons . The forward problem simulation results can be directly applicable in a variety of scientific and technological fields .
