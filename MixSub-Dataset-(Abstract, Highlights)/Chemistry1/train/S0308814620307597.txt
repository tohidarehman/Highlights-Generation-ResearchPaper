 Because of the need to abolish the castration of piglets without anaesthesia analgesia the pig industry is searching for a mode of action for the valorisation of meat with boar taint an off odour in entire male pigs . Carcasses with boar taint were selected by means of sensory and chemical analysis after which patties with different levels of tainted boar meat were produced as well as cooked ham and Frankfurter sausages using different smoke condensates and cooking temperatures . For these products orthonasal and retronasal boar taint odour were assessed by a trained expert panel . The results offer guidance regarding dilution of tainted meat and the potential application of smoke condensates as promising boar taint masking strategies .
