 Two new copolymer grafted silica stationary phases were prepared and employed in hydrophilic interaction chromatography . 2 ethyl methacrylate are copolymerized with itaconic acid and acrylic acid respectively via thiol ene click reaction on silica surface with deep eutectic solvents as new solvents . The obtained poly grafted silica and poly grafted silica were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy elemental analysis and solid state
