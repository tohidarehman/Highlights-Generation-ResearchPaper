 Need of renewable green energy sources due to low cost synthesis mechanically strong high energy storage capacity with improved dielectric performance have been receiving much attention . Present work render the ZnO particle and flower like morphology assemble semicrystalline phase PVDF BT nanocomposite successfully synthesized by spin coating method and characterized by XRD SEM EDS and FTIR techniques . Also the energy storage density of composite with modified structure is largely increased with value 0.056 Jcm

@highlight ZnO assembled phase PVDF BT composites were well synthesized by spin coating.
@highlight Addition of filler in PVDF matrix enhanced energy density 66 higher with 82 efficiency.
@highlight Dielectric and mechanical properties of ZnO assembled composites were improved.
@highlight CV and GCD study reveals that P BT ZnO
@highlight nanocomposite possesses better potential material.
