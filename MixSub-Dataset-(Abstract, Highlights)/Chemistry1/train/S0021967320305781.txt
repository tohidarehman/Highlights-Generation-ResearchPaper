 Multi column continuous chromatography has advantages of high resin capacity utilization and productivity low buffer consumption and small footprint . Experimental optimization is often time consuming and inefficient due to the complexity of continuous processes . In this study a model based approach was investigated to improve process development of twin column continuous capture with Protein A affinity resin MabSelect PrismA . Breakthrough curves under various conditions productivity and capacity utilization
