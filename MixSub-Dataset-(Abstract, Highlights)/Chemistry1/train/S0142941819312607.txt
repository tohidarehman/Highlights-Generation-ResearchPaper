 Good transparency antimicrobial physical and tensile properties of the biodegradable film can be necessary for food packaging . The aim of this study is to characterize these properties of the poly ginger nanofiber bionanocomposite film . This nanofiber of 0.21 0.31 and 0.41g in suspensions was mixed with PVA gel using ultrasonication . After addition of ginger nanofibers the bionanocomposite film shows antibacterial activity but does not have antifungi activity . Increasing the nanofiber into PVA increases significantly in tensile properties water vapour impermeability and moisture resistance . Tensile strength the temperature at maximum film decomposition and moisture resistance of the 0.41g ginger nanofiber reinforced film were 44.2MPa 349.4C and 6.1 respectively compared to pure PVA . With this nanofiber loading the transparency of the bionanocomposite film decreased slightly . These results suggest this bionanocomposite film has potential in food packaging in industrial applications .

@highlight Drying of the nano sized fiber suspension resulted in a transparent film.
@highlight Ginger nanofibers with good microbial activity were mixed with PVA.
@highlight PVA ginger bionanocomposite had microbial activity and better performance than PVA.
@highlight This bionanocomposite has an alternative potential material for food packaging.
