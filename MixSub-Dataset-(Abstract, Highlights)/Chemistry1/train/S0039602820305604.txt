 A method for performing X ray absorption spectroscopy in the soft X ray region was developed to investigate the surface sensitive electron signal of electrode electrolyte interfaces in common multivalent based organic solvents under

@highlight A method for XAS was developed to probe electrode electrolyte interfaces in solvents.
@highlight In situ F K edge XAS of electron signal reveals evolution of interfacial species.
@highlight Operando XAS runs the CV and collects spectra simultaneously.
