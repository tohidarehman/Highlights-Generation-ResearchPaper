 Despite nearly 80 years of advancements in gas chromatography indirect chemical matrix effects known as the matrix induced response enhancement effect still occur to cause a high bias in the GC analysis of susceptible analytes unless precautions are taken . Matrix matched calibration is one common option used in GC to compensate for the MEs but this approach is usually inconvenient imprecise and inefficient . Other options such as the method of standard additions surface deactivation techniques chemical derivatizations priming the GC and or use of internal standards also have flaws in practice . When methods are accommodating the use of analyte protectants can provide the best practical solution to not only overcome MEs but also to maximize analyte signal by increasing chromatographic and detection efficiencies for the analytes . APs address the source of MEs in every injection by filling active sites in the GC inlet column and detector particularly in GCMS rather than the analytes that would otherwise undergo degradation peak tailing and or diminished response due to interactions with the active sites . The addition of an adequate amount of APs
