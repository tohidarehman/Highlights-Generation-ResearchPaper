 A sensitive fast eco friendly ultrasound assisted liquidliquid microextraction in combination with hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent method was developed to preconcentrate and extract sulfonamides in fruit juices prior to high performance liquid chromatographic analysis . The DES was synthesized with trioctylmethylammonium chloride and 2 octanol at the molar ratio of 1 2 . Some parameters which affected the extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized including the volume of DES extraction method extraction time pH . Under the optimum conditions good linearity

@highlight A new eco friendly hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent DES was synthesized.
@highlight The DES present excellent extraction efficiency for sulfonamides SAs .
@highlight Hydrophobic DESs based on UA LLME combined with HPLC UVD method was developed.
@highlight The method was applied in the determination of SAs from fruit juices.
