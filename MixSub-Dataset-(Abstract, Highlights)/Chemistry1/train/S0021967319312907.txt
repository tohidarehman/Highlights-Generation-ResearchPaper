 Polymers obtained from tetraethyl orthosilicate and triethoxymethylsilane have been functionalized with different metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and used as coatings of extractive capillaries for the extraction of polar compounds by in tube solid phase microextraction coupled on line to nano liquid chromatography . The extraction capabilities of the new phases have been studied using several triazinic herbicides with log of octanol water partition coefficients K

@highlight Polymers with different metal and metal oxide nanoparticles have been synthetized.
@highlight They have been used for in tube solid phase microextraction nano chromatography.
@highlight The new sorbents can be used for herbicides with broad polarities and amino acids.
@highlight Best results for the most polar compounds were obtained with CuO nanoparticles.
@highlight The new phase is compatible with reversed phase and HILIC separations.
