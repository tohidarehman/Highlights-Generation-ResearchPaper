 Two main issues are essential nowadays for practitioners in the field of polymeric materials how a polymer will behave under dynamic loading conditions and for how long a polymer is reliable . In this sense the time temperature superposition principle was applied to the main viscoelastic properties of a series of polyurethane coatings tested for mechatronic devices . Polyurethanes are derived from an ester glycol glycol an aromatic diisocyanate and di trifunctional chain extenders diethylene glycol and trimethylol propane . Despite polyurethane intrinsic rheologic complexity the moduli loss factor curves superimpose well over several decades of reduced frequency at the glass transition temperature T

@highlight The three criteria for thermorheological simplicity verify at Tg 0C and 15C.
@highlight The structures PU DEG TMP present good equilibrium strength toughness at 15C.
@highlight PU DEG and PU DEG TMP have crosslinked network behaviour along the frequency range.
@highlight The effect of the pendent methylol groups is effective at positive temperatures.
@highlight At 15C the free volume fraction increases almost three times for PU DEG TMP.
