 The screening of potential extractant from a set of ionic liquids to extract benzene from cyclohexane with COSMO RS model was conducted in this work . The ternary liquidliquid equilibrium of benzene plus cyclohexane plus I

@highlight  BMIM I
@highlight is selected as the optimum extractant to separate benzene from cyclohexane with the application of COSMO RS model.
@highlight Factors affecting the predictive result were found to better agree with the experimental result.
@highlight Quantum calculation is investigated to uncover the mechanism of the extracting process.
