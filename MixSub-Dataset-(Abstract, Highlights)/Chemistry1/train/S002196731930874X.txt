 We report the discovery preliminary investigation and demonstration of a novel form of differential flow modulation for comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography . Commercially available components are used to apply a flow of carrier gas with a suitable applied auxiliary gas pressure

@highlight A simple and effective means to accomplish differential flow modulation is introduced.
@highlight Total transfer unit duty cycle is achieved concomitant with full modulation.
@highlight Commercially available components are used to construct the low cost modulator.
@highlight Narrow peaks are produced yielding high signal enhancements.
@highlight Separations of a 5 component test mixture a 90 component test mixture and a diesel fuel are provided.
