 Polymer coated fertilizer has been designed for gradual release of nutritional content of fertilizer to improve the utilization efficiency . However the better slow release property of the coated fertilizer and simplified preparation process are still a huge challenge . The hydrophobic ODA polyphenol film coated urea was prepared by one step spraying for excellent nutrient release performance . Octadecylamine was used to modify poly and poly coating on substrates and prepare the hydrophobic ODA PTA and ODA PPG coated urea granules . The nutrient release rate of ODA PTA and ODA PPG coated fertilizers was much slower than PTA and PPG coated fertilizers in water and soil . The N release longevities of ODA PTA coated fertilizers will be extended from 2h to 30 days compared with PTA coated fertilizers . Moreover pot experiments showed that coated fertilizer could effectively promote plant growth . This work will provide one step spraying co deposition approach to fabricate hydrophobic ODA polyphenol film coated urea to improve the N release longevity which can shine a light on the development of new slow release fertilizers .
