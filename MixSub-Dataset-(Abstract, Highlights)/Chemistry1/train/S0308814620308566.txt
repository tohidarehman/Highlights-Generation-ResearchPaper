 Xiangshan Bay provides most of the seafood for residents from the southeast coast of China . However information on the safety of local seafood was not well known . In this study we investigated the residue spatial distribution and potential health risks of ten polychlorinated biphenyls in seafood and surface sediment samples during six years . The results indicated the level of PCBs in 9 types of seafood from Xiangshan Bay ranged between ND and 25.3ngg

@highlight The residue and spatial distribution of PCBs in seafood were investigated.
@highlight The biota sediment accumulation factors were determined.
@highlight Penta CB and Hexa CB was the dominant congeners in seafood.
