 A method is described for the functionalization of magnetic carbon nanotubes to recognize aristolochic acid and . 3 Glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane was used as a coupling agent to immobilize adenine on a solid support . The morphology and structure of adenine coated magnetic carbon nanotubes was investigated using transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy X ray diffraction and a vibrating sample magnetometer . The adsorption performance of the adenine coated magnetic carbon nanotubes was evaluated via adsorption isotherms the kinetics and selectivity tests . The adsorption capacity of the adenine functionalized sorbent for aristolochic acid was determined to be 24.5g mg

@highlight A novel magnetic nanocomposite was designed and synthesized by using adenine.
@highlight Adenine was used to provide adsorption site based on multiple interactions.
@highlight The magnetic nanocomposite can selectively recognize aristolochic acids.
@highlight The nanocomposite was exploited to extract aristolochic acids from TCMs.
