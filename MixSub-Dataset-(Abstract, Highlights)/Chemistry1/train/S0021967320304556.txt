 Trapping volatiles is a convenient way to study aroma compounds but it is important to determine which volatile trapping method is most comprehensive in extracting the most relevant aroma components when investigating complex food products . Awareness of their limitations is also crucial . targeted metabolomic approaches were used to determine the volatile profiles of two commercial flavourings . Four trapping techniques were tested as was the addition of salt to the mixture . Comprehensiveness and repeatability were compared and SBSE proved particularly suitable for extracting components such as polysulfides pyrazines and terpene alcohols and provided an overall broader chemical spectrum . SPME proved to be more suitable in extracting sesquiterpenes and DHS in extracting monoterpenes . Adding salt to the sample had only quantitative effects on volatiles as detected by SPME . These results help clarify the advantages and limitations of different trapping techniques and hence deliver a valuable decision tool for food matrix analysis .

@highlight Untargeted metabolomics approaches help understand flavour and chemical composition
@highlight Process flavours comprise diverse complex mixtures of volatile compounds
@highlight The highest number of volatiles detected was achieved by SBSE
@highlight Sorptive extraction is environmentally friendlier than organic solvent extraction
