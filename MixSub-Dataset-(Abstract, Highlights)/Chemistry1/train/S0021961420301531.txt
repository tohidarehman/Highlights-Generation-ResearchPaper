 The equilibrium solubility is the basis for purification and further theoretical studies of o vanillin . In this paper the solubility data of o vanillin in three pure solvents including water ethanol n propanol and two binary solvents of water ethanol and water n propanol has been experimented under atmospheric pressure

@highlight An isothermal saturation method was used to test the solubility of o vanillin.
@highlight Modified Apelblat equation was used to correlate the experimental solubility data.
@highlight The thermodynamic parameters such as
@highlight were achieved by vant Hoff analysis.
@highlight Co solvency and liquid liquid phase separation phenomena was observed.
