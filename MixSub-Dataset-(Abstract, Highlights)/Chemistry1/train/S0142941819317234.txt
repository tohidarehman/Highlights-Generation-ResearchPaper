 Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene is a high performance material that has excellent wear and impact strength compared to other polymers . Due to its chemical structure and molecular mass UHMWPE is difficult to handle on standard extrusion systems . In this paper the compounding rheological and mechanical behavior of different Polypropylene UHMWPE blends were investigated . Raw materials were blended on a co rotating twin screw extruder . The shear and extensional viscosity of polymer blends were investigated using an inline rheometer . Mechanical and rheological properties were presented for various UHMWPE loadings and correlations between mechanical and rheological data were examined .

@highlight The compounding as well the rheological and mechanical behavior of different Polypropylene PP UHMWPE blends was investigated.
@highlight Raw materials were blended on a co rotating twin screw extruder and the shear and extensional viscosity of polymer melts was investigated by the use of an inline rheometer.
@highlight The mechanical and rheological properties were presented for various UHMWPE loadings and correlations between mechanical and rheological data were shown.
