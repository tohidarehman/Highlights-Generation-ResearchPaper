 In this study in source fragmentation in ultra high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was investigated and applied for pesticide residue analysis . Over 400 pesticides were tested among which 26 pesticides were found to be sensitive to in source fragmentation producing 33 in source fragments . The fragment pathways were studied and severe in source fragmentation was observed due to the cleavage of C O bond of carbamate phosphate ester and ether groups especially for isocarbophos and methoprene leading to false negative results . High source temperatures could significantly increase the extent of in source fragmentation . A multiple reaction monitoring based multiresidue method was established for the pesticide residue analysis in vegetables and fruits applying both pesticides and in source fragments as precursors . The quantification ability of the method was validated and compared in terms of recovery linearity and the limit of quantification . In source fragmentswere found to be more suitable than their parent pesticides as precursor ions for MRM analysis .

@highlight In source fragmentation mechanisms for typical pesticides were investigated
@highlight High source temperature significantly accelerated in source fragmentation
@highlight MRM based analytical method using in source fragments were developed
@highlight In source fragments were superior to their parent pesticides in method performances
