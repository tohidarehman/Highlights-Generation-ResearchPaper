 It has been shown in previous works that the interfacial adhesion in PPTA and PBO epoxy composites can be improved by modifying the surface properties of these high performance fibres upon exposure to non oxidative plasma treatments . In this work the effects developed on both types of polymer surface were examined as a function of treatment gas nature He or N

@highlight IGC proved non oxidative plasma treatments activate surfaces of PPTA and PBO fibres.
@highlight Thermodynamic properties measured at zero coverage showed differences on both fibres.
@highlight In the case of PBO low energy surfaces were attained either under He or under N
@highlight Surface polarity increased onto nitrogen plasma treated PPTA surface.
@highlight He plasma caused side oxidation and an increase of roughness on PPTA fibre.
