 The liquid crystal state is an ordered physical state between a solid and a liquid . Previous research in gas chromatography proved that it provides a geometric selectivity which allows the separation of geometric position isomers and

@highlight BHOBP is the first liquid crystal stationary phase for GC bearing a bromine atom.
@highlight The supercooled liquid crystal state was stable over several weeks.
@highlight BHOBP improved the shape selectivity of low boiling organic compounds.
@highlight An original selectivity for geometric isomers was obtained.
