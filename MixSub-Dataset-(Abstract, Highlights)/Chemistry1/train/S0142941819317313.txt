 This article presents an experimental investigation into the adhesion between aluminum and epoxy nanocomposites reinforced with multi walled carbon nanotubes . The nanotubes are dispersed in epoxy chemically with the aid of a surfactant rather than mechanically via high shear mixing or ultrasonication . Four MWCNT weight fractions are considered viz . 0 0.1 0.5 and 1 . The adhesion with aluminum is tested via end notched flexure tests conducted on specimens consisting of Aluminum strips adhered together with various epoxy nanocomposite glues . The best results are obtained for 1 MWCNT where the tests show a notable increase in adhesion evidenced by an intact bond despite considerable plastic deformation of Aluminum . However the peak load capacity is seen to be not enhanced . The higher adhesion with 1 MWCNT addition is seen to successfully suppress the brittle debonding failures even at very high levels of adherend plasticity . For this weight fraction the overall response is highly ductile involving shearing of the glue and is desirable for engineering applications . Despite promising results the surfactant itself is seen to be not very effective as a dispersing agent for the epoxy resin considered here .

@highlight Addition of MWCNT s enhanced adhesion between epoxy and Aluminum.
@highlight Displacement sustained before failure was enhanced but not the peak load.
@highlight Best results are obtained with 1 MWCNT by weight.
@highlight Surfactant was not effective as dispersing agent for the chosen epoxy.
