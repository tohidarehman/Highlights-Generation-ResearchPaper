 Using rubber to toughen polylactide is always accompanied by the sharp reduction in stiffness . Herein PLA poly grafted natural rubber thermoplastic vulcanizates with balanced stiffness toughness were fabricated . With the addition of 40wt NR PMMA the impact strength and tensile toughness of PLA NR PMMA TPV significantly improved to about 102.7kJ m

@highlight PLA NR PMMA binary TPVs with co continuous phase morphology were prepared.
@highlight In situ situ compatibilization between plastic and rubber phases was realized.
@highlight Balanced stiffness toughness of the TPVs was achieved.
@highlight A novel toughening model was introduced and showed good precision on predicting impact strength.
@highlight All the materials used in this work are biobased and sustainable.
