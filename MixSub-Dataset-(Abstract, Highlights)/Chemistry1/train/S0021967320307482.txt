 Organic gel has excellent characteristics including a large surface area adjustable pore channel size and good chemical stability and has attracted great attention in the field of materials . However the OG packed column is difficult to pack due to the weak mechanical strength and poor monodispersity . Herein 1 allyl 3 methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate co 1 dodecanethiol PF

@highlight The adhesion of organic gel simplify the synthesis of stationary phase materials.
@highlight It doesn t need any silane coupling agent so it reduces the waste of raw materials.
@highlight The prepared stationary phase materials can separate in multiple separation modes.
@highlight A new idea of using organic gel as liquid chromatography packing for separation.
