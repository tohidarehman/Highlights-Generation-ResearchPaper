 Fixed dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine is one of the most preferred FDC for the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome human immunodeficiency virus infection . To the best of authors knowledge there are no reported methods for chiral purity estimation of both drugs simultaneously from a FDC . The current study was focused on the development of a single chiral method uisng supercritical fluid chromatography for separation of stereoisomers of TDF and 3TC combination employing design of experiment approach . Method development was planned in three steps by using different experimental designs for each step . I optimal Taguchi orthogonal array and face centred central composite designs were employed for primary parameter selection secondary parameter screening and final method optimization respectively . All six stereoisomers were separated in a 10 minute run on Chiralpak IA column with carbon di oxide methanol as mobile phase at 1.5 mL min in gradient mode . The optimized method was verified for performance through establishing specificity precision linearity accuracy limit of quantification and solution stability . Resolution between each isomeric pair was more than 1.5 . The method was found to be linear from 1.5 g mL to 7.5 g mL for 3TC and 7.5 g mL to 37.5 g mL for TDF stereoisomers . The R
