 The application of chiral ionic liquids in capillary electrophoresis for enantioseparation has received considerable attention in the past few years however the use of chiral ILs as ligands in ligand exchange capillary electrophoresis has been reported only in a few papers . In this work several tetraalkylammonium amino acid ILs including tetramethylammonium

@highlight Three TAA AAILs were first applied in LE CE to act as chiral ligands.
@highlight TMA 
@highlight  Arg showed significant superiority compared with most reported AAIL ligands.
@highlight Most analytes were enantioseparated with satisfactory Rs in short migration times.
@highlight Factors influencing the novel LE CE method were systematically investigated.
