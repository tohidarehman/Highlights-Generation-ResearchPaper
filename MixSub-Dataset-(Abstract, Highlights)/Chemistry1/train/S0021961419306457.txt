 Vapour pressure complementary data for two key apple aroma esters ethyl butyrate and ethyl hexanoate two compounds with high relevance to the food industry were measure with a dynamic recirculation apparatus . For pressures from kPa the temperatures experimentally assessed were from K for ethyl butyrate and from K for ethyl hexanoate . Results of the vapour pressures were correlated using Antoines extended Antoines and Wagners equations . Relative root mean square deviations were lower than 0.38 and 0.94 for ethyl butyrate and ethyl hexanoate respectively . Experimental data of dibutoxymethane showed reasonable consistency with the information available in the literature . The vaporisation enthalpies were evaluated using the Clapeyron equation together with the Virial equation of state to estimate the vapour compressibility factor as well a correlation for saturated liquid molar volume . The results for both esters were comparable with data from the literature .

@highlight Vapor pressures of two key apple odorants were measured.
@highlight Measurements were made over the temperature range of 340 to 441 K.
@highlight The parameters of Antoine and Wagner type equations were estimated.
@highlight The relative deviations from the three vapor pressure equations were 0.9 .
@highlight Vaporization enthalpies were estimated using the Clapeyron equation.
