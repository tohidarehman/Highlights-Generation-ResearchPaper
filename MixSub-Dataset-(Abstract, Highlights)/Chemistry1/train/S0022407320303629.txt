 The integro differential radiative transfer equation for concentric cylinders problem involving scattering absorption and emission is solved using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method . The space angle DG method directly solves the cylindrically symmetric RTE as a three dimensional problem where a 1D spatially domain in radial distance
