 Polyethylene terephthalate is the third most widely diffused polymer exploited in the packaging industry monopolizing the bottles market for beverages and covering almost the 16 of the European plastic consumption in the packaging industry . Even if PET primarily derived from fossil sources and remains not biodegradable in the environment novel advancements in the field pointed out the possibility of producing PET in a more sustainable way or the possibility of biodegrade this polyester through the enzymatic action of specific genetically modified isolated bacteria enzymes . By considering also the high recyclability of PET and the possibility of potentially indefinitely re use this material one can assume that the future of PET is still to be written . Therefore all aspects involving the industrial production intrinsic physicochemical thermal mechanical properties undesired degradation phenomena chemical mechanical recycling processes and processability of PET are here critically discussed . A particular emphasis has been dedicated to the role of PET in the packaging industry . The main achievements in the PET processing for food packaging are presented analyzing advantages and disadvantages of each technology . This document aims at providing a useful instrument that collects past present and future of the PET a well consolidated material that has been able to renew itself over time .
