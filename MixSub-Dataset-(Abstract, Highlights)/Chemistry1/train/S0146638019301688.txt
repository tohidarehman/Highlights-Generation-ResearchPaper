 Large amounts of light oil have been produced from carbonate reservoirs at depths below 7km in the recently discovered Shunbei and Yuecan oil fields within the north Tarim Basin . Eighteen samples were investigated for molecular and isotopic compositions to help understand the origin of these deep oil accumulations . Several ratios based on C

@highlight Light oils in 7km deep reservoirs in the Tarim Basin are not altered by gas washing.
@highlight They are highly mature and at the beginning or early stage of intense oil cracking.
@highlight Molecular and isotopic compositions indicate a similar source of these oils.
@highlight Sample SB7 differs in terms of source rock depositional conditions.
