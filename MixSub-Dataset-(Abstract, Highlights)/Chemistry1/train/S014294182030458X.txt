 This research presents the effects of oxygen pressure and ambient temperatures on the crack behavior of O rings from a semi EV of NR EPDM rubber with silica CB filler exposed to the inlet flow and outflow oxygen pressure in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell environment . Blends of NR EPDM were prepared with various ratios of silica CB filler at 00 60 10 50 20 40 30 30 40 20 50 10 and 60 00 phr . The fabricated O ring complied with the standard for O rings with a minimum hardness of 6575 Shore A minimum tensile strength of 9MPa minimum elongation at break of 200 and a minimum 100 modulus of 2.7MPa . The mechanical properties of the compounds were tested and the appropriate compound was chosen to make the O rings to test in SOFC . The crack morphology of the fabricated O rings was investigated and compared with a commercial O ring after testing in the SOFC . As a result the compound with silica CB of 40 20 ratio provided the optimum mechanical properties and passed the criteria standard of TIS 2728 2559 . The mechanical properties of the prepared and commercial O rings were similar

@highlight Blends of natural and ethylene propylene diene monomer rubbers were prepared with silica and carbon black hybrid fillers.
@highlight All formulations were prepared in the internal mixture and on a two roll mill machine.
@highlight O rings were moulded from semi efficient sulphur vulcanization.
@highlight Mechanical properties of all compounds before and after ageing were tested.
@highlight O rings were exposed to oxygen gas pressure at flow rate of 0.5L min and ambient temperature in solid oxide fuel cell SOFC .
