 Silicone acrylic resin was prepared from acrylic monomers and silicone prepolymer by the free radical solution polymerization and then mixed TiO

@highlight The novel synthesized processing to nano hybrid silicone acrylic resin was proposed.
@highlight The nano hybrid silicone acrylic resin exhibits an excellent thermostability and hydrophobicity.
@highlight The corrosion resistance is significantly improved by adding mixed nano TiO
@highlight and nano SiO
@highlight The UV resistance and weather resistance of the resin is improved by adding mixed nano TiO
@highlight and nano SiO
@highlight The synergistic effects of mixed nano TiO
@highlight and SiO
@highlight modified can improve the performance of the resin.
