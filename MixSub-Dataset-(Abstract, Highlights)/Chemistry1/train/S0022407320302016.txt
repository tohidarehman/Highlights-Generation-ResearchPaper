 The accuracy of atmospheric trace gas retrievals depends directly on the accuracy of the molecular absorption model used within the retrieval algorithm . For remote sensing of well mixed gases such as carbon dioxide CO

@highlight Absorption coefficients for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory missions updated to v5.1 for the B10 Level 2 algorithm.
@highlight Improved spectroscopy for Oxygen A band results in reduced spatial variability in surface pressure retrieval bias.
@highlight Orbiting Carbon Observatory retrievals are sensitive to changes to the water vapor continuum model.
