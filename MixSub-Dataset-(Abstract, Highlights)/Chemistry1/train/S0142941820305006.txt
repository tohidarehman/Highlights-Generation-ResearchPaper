 Various complications such as posterior capsule opacification and endophthalmitis occur after intraocular lenses implantation in cataract surgery . It is urgent to construct antifouling and antibacterial IOLs to lower the incidence of PCO and endophthalmitis . Bionic zwitterionic polymer such as 2 methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine shows excellent performance in resisting nonspecific proteins and bacterial adhesion . In this work a novel bionic brushes coating containing MPC and N N N trimethyl 2 ethoxy 4 oxobut 2 enoyl oxy ethan 1 aminium chloride a quaternary ammonium monomer was prepared onto IOLs using reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer polymerization method . The P TOEAC

@highlight A novel PU PDA Hep CMCS coating was prepared onto implants mediated by polydopamine.
@highlight The PU PDA Hep CMCS coating exhibited excellent improved hemocompatibility.
@highlight The PU PDA Hep CMCS coating showed excellent antibacterial and anti biofilm abilities.
@highlight The PU PDA Hep CMCS coating is promising for implants modification for long term implantation.
