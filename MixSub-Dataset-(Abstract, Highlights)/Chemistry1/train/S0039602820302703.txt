 Herein four tetrazole derivatives namely 1 2 3 4 tetrazole 5 amino 1 2 3 4 tetrazole 1 phenyl 1 2 3 4 tetrazole and 1 phenyl 5 mercapto 1 2 3 4 tetrazole were investigated as corrosion inhibitors on Cu surface in acidic medium . For this purpose theoretical investigations were carried out preferentially with Density Functional Theory at LeeYangParr correlation functional using 6 31 g basis set . Numerous global and locale descriptors of reactivity such as E

@highlight Four tetrazole derivatives were studied in this work.
@highlight DFT calculations and
@highlight simulations were used to understand the adsorption behavior of studied molecules.
@highlight Based on the theoretical results the inhibitor molecules are compared and discussed.
@highlight The observed inhibition efficiencies were successfully explained and correlated with calculated descriptors.
@highlight These results confirm the inhibitor efficiencies previously tested in our laboratory.
