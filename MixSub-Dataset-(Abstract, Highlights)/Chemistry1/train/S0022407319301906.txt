 Hot spots have been considered as a dominant role in surface enhancement Raman scattering . Here we investigated the size and shape effect of Ag nanocubes in surface plasmon response and SERS by both experiment and theory simulation method . Silver nanocubes with abundant hot spots were synthesized by a polyol method and utilized as electrodes for achieving high SERS enhancement . The absorption wavelengths of the nanocubes were tunable by changing the edge lengths of the nanoparticles . Finite difference time domain simulations were employed to investigate the local E field generation around silver nanocubes indicating remarkable E field enhancement at the edges and vertexes known as hot spots . Then the SERS analyses demonstrated that the SERS activity of various Ag nanocubes using crystal violet as probe molecules showed a significant enhancement . The enhancement factors of SERS show strong sensitivity between the nanoparticle size and shape . Moreover the enhancement for CV on Ag nanocubes was significantly higher than for Ag nanospheres . Therefore the stable and high performance of Ag nanocubes SERS system shows great application prospects in both scientific researches and practical application .
