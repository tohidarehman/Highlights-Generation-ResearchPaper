 Surfactants are used in various applications cosmetics pharmaceuticals petrochemicals environmental etc . Many of these compounds are polydisperse and because of this intrinsic polydispersity it is essential to have a universal detector with a uniform response to quantify them in a simple way . Indeed Charged Aerosol Detector was presented as a universal detector with a uniform response . Thus in the present study the CAD response in a High Performance Liquid Chromatography CAD configuration HPLC

@highlight HLIC CAD analysis of alcohol ethoxylated surfactants.
@highlight Isolation of homologues by semipreparative separation.
@highlight Determination of response factor of homologues.
@highlight Unexpected very different response factors.
