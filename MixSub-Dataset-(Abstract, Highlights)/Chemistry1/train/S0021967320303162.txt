 A two membrane electrodialytic carbonate eluent generator for ion chromatography is described . It is in a sandwich like configuration in which the central eluent channel is spatially isolated from two outer regenerant channels by stacked cation exchange membranes and anion exchange membranes . A platinum screen electrode is placed in each of two outer regenerant channels . The electrode at the CEMs side is set as an anode with respect to the electrode at the AEMs side being cathode . Potassium carbonate and or bicarbonate solution is pumped into the regenerant channel as feed solution . The electromigration of carbonate and or bicarbonate and potassium from feed solution respectively through AEMs and CEMs will form a gas free eluent . With this configuration ion transport behavior through AEMs was explored . The device demonstrated good reproducibility as indicated by the relative standard deviation of retention time of less than 0.08 .
