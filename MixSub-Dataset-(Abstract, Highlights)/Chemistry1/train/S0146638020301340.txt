 The construction and reliable application of maturation indices is extremely important in deep Earth exploration yet predicting levels of maturation on a molecular level especially at overmature stages is still a major challenge . Here we report robust broad ranging and precise maturity parameters that were developed using a continuous core of thermally overmature lacustrine deposits from the deep Songke 2 Well Songliao Basin China augmented by shallow cores of lower maturity marine deposits from the Hils Syncline Germany .
