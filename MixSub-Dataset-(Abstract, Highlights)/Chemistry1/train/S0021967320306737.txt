 A new and sensitive analytical method for the simultaneous determination of secondary lipid peroxidation aldehydes has been successfully developed and validated . Malondialdehyde acrolein formaldehyde acetaldehyde propanal and pentanal were extracted and derivatized using 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine by gas diffusion microextraction combined with dispersive liquid liquid microextraction for gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis . The experimental conditions have been optimized by experimental designs . The analytical method validation in accordance to the Food and Drug Administration guidance provided good results in terms of linearity with r

@highlight The first gas diffusion microextraction combined with dispersive liquid liquid microextraction for analysis of lipid peroxidation aldehydes.
@highlight Occurrence of lipid peroxidation aldehydes in edible oil samples was characterized by GCMS analysis.
@highlight The highest contents of malondialdehyde were found in pomace olive oil.
@highlight Acrolein and propanal were quantified in all the samples.
@highlight Lipid peroxidation aldehydes showed potential to be used as food quality markers.
