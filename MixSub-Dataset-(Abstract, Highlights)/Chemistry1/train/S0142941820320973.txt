 The goal of the study was to prepare a graphene dispersion in a poly solution with enhanced stability of the nanofiller thanks to the application of curcuma extract . The stable dispersion was used to obtain PVC GN nanocomposites with more homogeneous graphene by the solvent evaporation method . The CE effectiveness was compared with two commercially available dispersants in the form of oleic acid and polysorbate 80 .

@highlight PVC nanocomposites with graphene were prepared by solution casting method with the use of dispersing agents.
@highlight The dispersion stability of graphene in PVC solution was tested by turbidimetric method. .
@highlight Structure and graphene dispersion level in PVC matrix were investigated by SEM and Raman spectroscopy.
@highlight The use of
@highlight rhizome extract has significantly improved GN dispersion in poly vinyl chloride matrix.
