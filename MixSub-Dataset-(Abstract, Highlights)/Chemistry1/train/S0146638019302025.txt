 Due to multi stage tectonic movements many oil reservoirs in typical superimposed basins of China have undergone more than one secondary alteration . Typically these oil reservoirs experienced biodegradation at an early stage followed by thermal alteration at a later stage . The extent of each secondary alteration can be variable . Here the succession of biodegradation and subsequent thermal alteration is called superimposed secondary alteration . This study aims not only to show the superimposed secondary alteration process in the reservoir by laboratory simulations but also to show how varying extents of biodegradation influence the gas generation behavior of crude oils under thermal stress . Hydrocarbon gas generation potential is significantly reduced at the low to moderate biodegradation stage because of the selective removal of normal and branched alkanes . Hydrocarbon gases generated from the more severely biodegraded oils are drier attributable to the decreasing yields of C

@highlight Microbial removal of alkanes reduces gas generation potential.
@highlight Biodegraded oil yields more solid bitumen and less gas during cracking.
@highlight Thermogenic hydrocarbon gases from more severely biodegraded oils are drier.
@highlight Thermal stability of crude oil decreases during biodegradation.
