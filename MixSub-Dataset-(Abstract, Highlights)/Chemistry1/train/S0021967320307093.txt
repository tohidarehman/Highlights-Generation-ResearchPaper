 Atmospheric particulate matter is made up of suspended microscopic solid or liquid materials . It is derived from natural or anthropogenic sources . PM encompasses inhalable coarse particles with aerodynamic diameters of between 2.5m and 10m fine particles and ultrafine particles . In addition to being directly inhalable causing harm PM can also exert adverse effects on human wellbeing and the environment by its impact on precipitation and climate . Moreover chemical contaminants may also be found adsorbed on PM adding another dimension to the hazardous aspects of these materials . PM is normally collected on filters or impactors . PM adsorbed contaminants need to be taken into solution before they can be extracted . This review focuses on a discussion of solvent minimized sample preparation procedures originally developed for aqueous samples for the extraction and preconcentration of primarily organic contaminants from fine and coarse PM .
