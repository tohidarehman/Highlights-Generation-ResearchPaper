 Pentacyclic triterpenoids possess high biological activity including antitumor anti inflammatory antiviral and hepatoprotective properties and are widespread in a plant biomass . Due to significant differences in polarity and other physicochemical properties the simultaneous determination of different classes of PCTs by the methods of reversed phase liquid chromatography is difficult . In the present study we proposed a new approach to chromatographic separation of such compounds based on the use of a stationary phase with a mixed retention mechanism combining hydrophobic weak anion exchange and hydrophilic interactions . The use of the Acclaim Mixed Mode WAX 1 column and tuning the selectivity by changing the contributions of different types of analytestationary phase interactions allowed the separation of 10 PCTs belonging to four different classes during 7.5min in isocratic elution mode . The combination of this approach with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometric detection and pressurized liquid extraction of analytes with methanol allowed to develop a rapid accurate and highly sensitive method for analyzing PCTs in plant tissues with a total duration of the analytical cycle of not more than 40min . It provides the detection limits in plant biomass extracts of 312gL
