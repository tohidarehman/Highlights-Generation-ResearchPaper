 In this work graphene nanoplatelet filled polymethyl methacrylate composites were prepared using solution method via a specially designed route and relatively high thermal conductivities of the composites were achieved at a low GNP loading . The effect of GNP content on rheological behavior thermal and electrical conductivity of the composites was intensively investigated . Thermorheological complexity was displayed at elevated GNP loading and the rheological percolation threshold of GNP in PMMA decreased from 7.96wt at 220C to 4.02wt at 260C according to
