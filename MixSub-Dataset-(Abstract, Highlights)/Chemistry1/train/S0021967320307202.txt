 The effect of bead and ligand structure on protein adsorption was investigated for multimodal anion exchangers combining a quaternary ammonium ion group with hydrophobic moieties Nuvia aPrime 1 and aPrime 2 based on a 54 m diameter polymeric bead and Capto Adhere ImpRes and Capto Adhere based on agarose beads 51 and 78 m diameter respectively . Bovine serum albumin monomer BSA dimer and thyroglobulin were used as model proteins . Based on TEM imaging and iSEC the Nuvia resins have a microgranular structure and large pores while the Capto resins have a fibrous structure and smaller pores . Comparable binding capacities decreasing as salt is added are observed for all three proteins on the Nuvia resins . Higher capacities also decreasing as salt is added are observed for BSA monomer and dimer on the Capto resins . However the Tg binding capacity is very low in this case and increases as salt is added . Confocal laser scanning microscopy show that the kinetics are controlled by pore diffusion for all four resins but with diffusivities that decrease as the protein size increases especially for the Capto resins . For Tg at low salt binding is restricted to a thin shell close to the bead surface for both Capto resins . The ratio of effective and free diffusivity is about 0.30 0.18 and 0.08 for BSA monomer BSA dimer and Tg respectively on the Nuvia resin . These values decrease to about 0.11 0.04 and 0.01 respectively for the Capto resins as a result of diffusional hindrance . Dynamic binding capacities are consistent with the equilibrium and rate behaviors .
