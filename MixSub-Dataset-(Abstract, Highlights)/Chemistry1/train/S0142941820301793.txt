 Fused deposition modeling is an important process among the available additive manufacturing technologies in various industries . Although there exists many works investigating the effects of FDM process parameters on the mechanical properties of printed materials there are still several points need to be studied . One is the effects of process parameters on the dynamic mechanical properties of FDM printed materials especially in environments where the temperature often changes . The other is the mechanism by which process parameters affect the mechanical properties of printed materials . Aiming at these two points uniaxial tensile tests and dynamic mechanical analysis are carried out respectively to characterize the tensile properties and dynamic mechanical properties of FDM printed PLA materials under different FDM process parameters namely printing angle layer thickness fill rate and nozzle temperature . Based on the experimental results explanations are given for the influence of the FDM process parameters on the mechanical properties of the printed materials .

@highlight The effects of the four FDM process parameters on the tensile and dynamic mechanical properties of the printed PLA materials were studied experimentally.
@highlight Printing angle mainly affects the fracture mode of the FDM printed PLA materials.
@highlight Layer thickness mainly affects the interlayer bonding strength of the printed materials and the smaller the printing angle the greater the effect.
@highlight The fill rate mainly affects the air gap inside the printed material.
@highlight Nozzle temperature mainly affects the fluidity of extruded material.
