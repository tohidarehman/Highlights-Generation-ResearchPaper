 A single step copolymerization strategy was developed for the preparation of carbohydrate functionalized monoliths using click reaction . Firstly novel carbohydrate functionalized methacrylate monomers were synthesized through Cu catalyzed 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition of terminal alkyne with azide of carbohydrate derivatives . The corresponding carbohydrate functionalized monolithic columns were then prepared through a single step

@highlight A novel single step strategy was developed for carbohydrate monolithic column.
@highlight Glucose and maltose functionalized monoliths were prepared and characterized.
@highlight The optimized monoliths showed great potential for separation and enrichment.
