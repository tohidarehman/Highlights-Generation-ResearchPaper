 The forms of potential energy surfaces in particular the potential functions of internal rotation the heights and forms of potential barriers to internal rotation and the energies of torsional levels can control some important properties of molecules and substances as well as the pathways and mechanisms of molecular processes .

@highlight For furfural in the S
@highlight state the three low energy vibrational motions are coupled.
@highlight The reason for one pair of vibrations is the anharmonicity of kinetic energy.
@highlight The reason for the coupling of other pairs of vibrations is the anharmonicity of potential energy.
@highlight Accounting for this interaction gives an accurate prediction of frequencies.
