 There is an urgent need for developing advanced purification techniques with the merits of low cost and satisfactory capacity in order to meet the challenges in the current downstream purification of monoclonal antibodies . Herein a simple and inexpensive nitrogen heterocycle molecule 1 vinylimidazole was proposed as the capture ligand of antibodies for the first time . The corresponding VIM based non affinity polymeric material was then fabricated via a one step polymerization for use in the highly selective purification of antibodies . Compared to the previously reported materials this novel material exhibited many advantages without clearly sacrificing selectivity such as a simpler and faster fabrication comparable or even higher binding capacity lower non specific protein adsorption and much lower cost . Notably the polyVIM can effectively purify the antibodies from multiple biological sources with high purity with an acceptable recovery and good reusability . Moreover the target ELISA binding assay and NFAT luc reporter gene assay demonstrated that the enriched antibodies can well maintain their binding activity and bioactivity during the whole purification process . The excellent performance of the polyVIM material may be attributed to the high recognition ability of VIM for antibodies as well as the biocompatible and antifouling properties of the porous polymer . This study provides a promising alternative material for the purification of mAbs in downstream processes and the enrichment of hIgG in human serum .
