 In the optical measurement of submicron particle properties extra scattering generated by excess surface charges is no longer negligible as that in micron particles . When the surface charge density exceeds a certain threshold the scattering behavior of the particles will be jointly dominated by the particles themselves and the surface charges . In this paper the complex refractive index model is extended to be appropriate for both electrically neutral particles and electrically charged particles and the mechanism is explained how surface charges affects elastic scattering . Taking the Mie theory of charged submicron spherical droplets of water with salt as an example the influence of the surface charges on the complex refractive index and the scattering properties is discussed . Further a threshold of the surface charge density is confirmed above which extra scattering can not be ignored . By calculating a angular distribution of the scattered light intensity it is found that electrically charges have a magnifying effect on forward and backscattering of the particles

@highlight Extend the complex refractive index model to the case of charged particles.
@highlight Excess surface charges affect visible light scattering of submicron spheres.
@highlight Surface charge amplifies the forward and backscattering of small particles.
@highlight Lower limit of optical measurement can be extended by using the amplification effect.
