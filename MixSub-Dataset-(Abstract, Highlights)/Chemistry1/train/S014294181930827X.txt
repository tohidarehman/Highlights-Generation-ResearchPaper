 The paper is devoted to investigations of exploitation properties of nonlinear optical polymer film materials based on an epoxy matrix doped with flavonoids . Adhesion of the polymer films to a glass substrate is investigated . Also the influence of photoinduced destruction on functional properties of these polymer composites by UVVis spectroscopy method is studied . Effect of various microorganisms such as mold fungi of
