 Microporous organic network is a promise class of functional materials in solid phase extraction . However the previous MON based SPE works are all focused on off line mode . The inherent drawbacks of off line SPE such as complicated operation steps and poor repeatability still hinder the potential applications of MON . In addition direct use of traditional synthesized nano sized MON in on line SPE is impractical . To solve these issues here we show the synthesis of silica amino functionalized MON SiO

@highlight microsphere was fabricated for on line SPE.
@highlight The developed on line SPE HPLC method gave wide linear range low LODs and large EFs for phenols.
@highlight Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction dominant the good extraction.
