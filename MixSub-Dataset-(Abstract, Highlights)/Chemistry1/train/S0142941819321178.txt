 In this work the optical absorption and thermal properties of polyimide aerogel have been investigated by Infrared Camera ultravioletvisible and photoacoustic spectroscopy under low energy proton irradiation . The characterization method of the infrared camera can obtain the optical absorption ratio and meanwhile get the information of specific heat capacity . Moreover it can acquire the nature information of damaged area rather than the overall performance . The results show an increase in optical absorption after proton irradiation which is in good coincidence with Ultravioletvisible spectroscopy analysis . And the specific heat capacity decreased linearly with proton fluences which can be attributed to the irradiation damage and carbonization in polyimide aerogel . The Raman spectra suggested the cleavage of chemical bonds and carbonization in polyimide aerogel . This work provides the novel non destructive and sensitive methods to characterize irradiation damage of aerogel .
