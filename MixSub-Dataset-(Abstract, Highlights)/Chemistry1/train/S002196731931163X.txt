 Surfactants are widely used in various petrochemical applications . Thus it is essential to have highly efficient analytical tools to monitor the different classes of surfactants commonly used . Three among the four known classes of surfactants were studied in the present work anionic nonionic and cationic . Thanks to high resolution mass spectrometry a useful mass list was created including 119m z values . This list was the foundation of a HRMS database which for the sake of simplicity will be further denoted only database . To avoid ion competition and streamline attribution of structural formulas for isobar molecules a suitable chromatographic method was used before MS . The retention behavior of six surfactants was evaluated under three separation modes reversed phase liquid chromatography hydrophilic interaction chromatography and mixed mode chromatography . In RPLC mode six columns were tested including C4 C18 C30 polar embedded C18 PFP and phenyl chemistries . Two HILIC columns were also tested including bare silica and urea chemistries . An anion exchange combined with RPLC mechanism was investigated as mixed mode mechanism . Using ammonium formate at 10mM as buffer provided the best signal in HRMS . In liquid chromatography acid conditions were preferred to avoid peak tailing due to residual silanols . The mixed mode separation mode clearly appears as the best compromise for the characterization of the three surfactants classes . Nevertheless the orthogonality observed for the separations obtained in HILIC and RPLC modes offers some possibilities for further multidimensional separations .
