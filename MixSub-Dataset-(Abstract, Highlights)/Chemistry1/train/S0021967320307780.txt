 Colorectal cancer is one of the most serious complications of ulcerative colitis . Altered gut microbiota is implicated in the development of CRC and metabolic perturbations are often associated with changes in the gut microbiome composition . Given the links between gut microbiome and the metabolic profiles in the body an approach involving ultra high performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics and 16S rDNA sequencing technology was applied to trace the development UC into CRC in rats . The study identified 11 differential metabolites related to both UC and CRC which mainly referred to the linoleic acid metabolism . Among these linoleic acid and 12hydroxy8 10 octadecadienoic acid could serve as key biomarkers for the development of UC into CRC . Besides a significant change was observed in the microflora structure during the development from UC to CRC this mainly involved a gradual increase in

@highlight Developed an original nontarget metabolomics UHPLC Q TOF MS MS method.
@highlight Identified and confirmed characteristic metabolites and intestinal microbiota.
@highlight Excavated a strong correlation between typical microflora and metabolites.
@highlight Results could provide targets for the prevention and treatment of UC to CRC.
