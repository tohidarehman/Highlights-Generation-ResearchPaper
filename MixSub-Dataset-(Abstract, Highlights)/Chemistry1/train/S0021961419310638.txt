 In this work the solubility of doxifluridine in methanol ethanol n propanol n butanol isobutanol n Pentanol n hexanol n octanol 2 ethyl 1 hexanol acetone dimethyl formamide dimethyl sulfoxide were experimentally determined by a laser dynamic method within the temperature range from 278.15K to 333.15K at 101.3kPa . The measured results demonstrated that the experimental solubility of doxifluridine in all selected pure solvents increased with the rise of temperature . It was also found that the order of the mole fraction solubility of doxifluridine in the twelve mono solvents was DMSO DMF methanol acetone ethanol n propanol n butanol n pentanol n hexanolisobutanol n octanol 2 ethyl 1 hexanol . In order to facilitate the industrial application and other studies the experimental data of solubility were fitted well using the h equation the van t Hoff equation the modified Apelblat equation the NRTL model and the UNIQUAC model . Moreover the apparent thermodynamic properties of doxifluridine in all mono solvents were investigated by the famous modified Van t Hoff equation from the solubility data .
