 The spectral investigation of triply ionized silver has been carried out in the vacuum ultraviolet region . Silver spectra excited through a triggered spark source were photographed on a 3 m normal incidence vacuum spectrograph at St. F. Xavier University Antigonish in Canada . The theoretical study of the spectrum was made through the quasi relativistic Hartree Fock formalism in Cowan s code . The previous work of Ag IV on the 4d
