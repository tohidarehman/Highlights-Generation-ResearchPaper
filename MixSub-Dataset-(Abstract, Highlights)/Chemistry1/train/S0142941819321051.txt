 This paper focuses on the experimental investigation and modelling of the crosslinking reaction of photopolymers used in additive manufacturing processes such as digital light processing and stereolithography . Starting with general mathematical concepts for the description of the material behaviour of polymeric materials the importance of modelling the crosslinking reaction is emphasised . In order to characterise the crosslinking reaction experimentally photocalorimetric measurements with varying isothermal temperature and light intensity are shown . From the exothermic heat flows measured during the crosslinking reaction the degree of cure can be determined for each experimental scenario as a function of time . It is shown that the test temperature and light intensity have a significant influence on the crosslinking reaction . A modelling approach for the description of the crosslinking reaction incorporating temperature and light intensity is presented . Moreover parameter identification and a comparison of the proposed model with the experiments are conducted . The identified model has an excellent match with experimental data resulting in a least square error smaller than 3 . The proposed model and identification method opens up several extensions for the modelling of the material behaviour .
