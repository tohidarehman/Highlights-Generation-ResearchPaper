 Dual channel chromatography was evaluated for pesticide residue analysis in fruits and vegetables and for unknown compounds detection . A dual channel system was tested coupled to triple quadrupole and high resolution mass spectrometry . The first part of the investigation was related to the improvement of the sample throughput with a 100mm column . The dual channel system provided the same analytical results as the single channel system however with the throughput higher of about 70 . Two types of calibration were checked . In the article also solvent consumption is discussed . Six proficiency test samples were analysed to assess the quality of the results . Nor false positives neither false negatives were found . Calculated z scores were typically 1 . In the second part a different approach was investigated . The 100mm column was replaced by a 150mm column keeping shorter run times than single channel system and 100mm . The longer column improved the sensitivity and selectivity what was demonstrated in the target pesticide residue analysis . Additionally the 150mm column was compared with the 100mm column in the analysis of unknown natural matrix compounds by high resolution mass spectrometry . The longer column allowed to detect up to 26 unknown compounds more than the shorter column .

@highlight dual channel chromatography improved identification and quantification.
@highlight the sample throughput increased considerably.
@highlight system facilitated application of a longer column.
@highlight dual channel chromatography improved the detection of non target compounds.
