 Porous organic frameworks are an exciting emerging type of porous organic materials in which molecular building blocks are linked by covalent bonds . POFs usually have high thermal and chemical stability large surface area artificially regulated pore size distribution and abundant functional groups which are considered to be ideal and efficient adsorbent for diverse compounds . They are an excellent alternative for sorbents coating based sample pretreatment techniques . In this review the application of various POFs in trace analysis is discussed in terms of pretreatment techniques including solid phase extraction magnetic solid phase extraction solid phase microextraction capillary microextraction and stir bar sorptive extraction . The POFs based sorbents coatings are reviewed with the focus on the construction process comparison among POFs and between POFs and common sorbents adsorption mechanism for specific analytes and the adsorption performance in trace analysis . Current research status indicate that much effort would be paid on further exploration of the relationship between the special properties of POFs and the adsorption behavior directional design and synthesis of POFs involved sorbents coating for trace analysis of organic substances and elemental species and the development of POFs involved analytical methodologies for quantification of interest analytes .
