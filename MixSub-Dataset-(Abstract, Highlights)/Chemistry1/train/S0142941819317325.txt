 Ternary composites of Polypropylene Short Glass fibers Hollow Glass Beads with varying total and relative GF HGB contents and using untreated and aminosilane treated HGB compatibilized with maleated PP were prepared by direct injection molding of pre extrusion compounded GF and HGB concentrates . The mechanical strength properties were correlated with theoretical model predictions for hybrid composites which identified synergistic gains over the rule of hybrid mixtures depending upon the degree of interfacial interactions between the components of the hybrid composite . SEM analysis of cryofractured composites surfaces revealed that the presence of untreated HGB particles induces fiber polymer interfacial decoupling under mechanical loading of the hybrid composites at much lower stress levels than in the presence of treated HGB particles . Higher storage modulus and lower mechanical damping from DMTA established the importance of strong polymer hybrid reinforcement interfacial interactions in the development of lightweight high strength PP syntactic foams .
