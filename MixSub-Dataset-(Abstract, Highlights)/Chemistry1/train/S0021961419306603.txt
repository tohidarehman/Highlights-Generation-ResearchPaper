 In polymer based aqueous biphasic systems the understanding the role of different types of polymers in phase separation is important in the selection of a suitable ABS used for separation of biomaterials . For this purpose in this work a systematic investigation of ternary aqueous solutions containing one deep eutectic solvent obtained from mixtures of choline chloride as HBA and D sucrose as HBD and different water soluble polymers polyethylene glycol 400 PEG

@highlight VLE for aqueous DES choline sucrose PEG400 PPG400 and PEGDME250 was measured.
@highlight Volumetric and ultrasonic studies were made on DES polymers.
@highlight DES polymer interactions were evaluated by all of the above methods.
@highlight DES polymer interactions for PPG are unfavorable and phase separation is occurred.
