 The present study deals with the effect of molecular weight of carrier fluid on the rheological behaviour of shear thickening fluid and impact energy absorption by treated

@highlight High molecular weight PEGs HMW PEG are effective rheology modifier.
@highlight HMW PEGs augment shear thickening phenomenon due to inherent higher viscosity.
@highlight Higher thickening doesn t translate into better impact performance in treated fabrics.
@highlight Lubrication caused by HMW PEG decreases inter yarn friction of fabric.
