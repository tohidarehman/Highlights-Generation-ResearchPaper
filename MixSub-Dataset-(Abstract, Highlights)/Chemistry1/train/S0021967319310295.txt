 An accurate quantification of phenolic compounds present in several kind of craft beers corresponding worts ingredients and spent products was performed by LCMS MS in this study . The dilution 1 2 of the sample with the mobile phase gave the best results offering a very fast and simple method to reduce the matrix effect . A validated method was applied to six different types of craft beers their worts starting and spent products such as barley malts and barley husks starting hops and spent hops and finally starting yeast and spent yeasts to quantify the selected phenolic compounds . The Total Phenol Content of barley malts is not negligible and it results almost prevalently due to trans

@highlight An accurate quantitative analysis of craft beers by LCMS MS identified phenolic acids and flavonoids mostly coming from malt and bitter acids and prenylflavonoids coming from hop.
@highlight Dilution 1 2 of the sample with the mobile phase offered a very fast and simple method to minimize the matrix effect.
@highlight Most polyphenols are absorbed into the yeast added for the fermentation.
@highlight Spent yeast can be considered a source of polyphenols coming from beers ingredients.
