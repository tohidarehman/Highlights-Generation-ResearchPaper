 p53 is a tumour suppressor gene that has been explored for cancer gene therapy as a possible alternative to the common treatments . The use of plasmid DNA to carry the therapeutic gene has been considered but it is requisite to preserve its supercoiled structure for eliciting a more effective gene expression and therapeutic action . The purification of the sc pDNA using amino acids based affinity chromatography has been successfully applied exploring different amino acids and supports . From these studies it stood out the selectivity of arginine for the recognition of sc pDNA . However some limitation on the binding capacity was found in the arginine agarose support and in the case of monoliths some fouling and clogging can limit sequential runs . By using macroporous support modified with arginine it was expected to take advantage of the selectivity of the ligand combined with the flow properties and binding capacity offered by the support . The arginine modified macroporous support was characterized by SEM EDX and FTIR also to verify the correct immobilization of arginine and then used for pDNA purification . The support showed to be effective on the sc p53 pDNA isolation and the robustness was also achieved by accomplishing the purification of plasmids with different sizes only by slightly adjusting the experimental conditions . Regarding the dynamic binding capacity of the arginine modified macroporous support it was achieved an improvement of more than 50 in the pDNA binding capacity when compared with their homologous arginine agarose commercial matrix suggesting potential economic feasibility in case of scale up .

@highlight Macroporous matrices present extremely good flow and binding capacity properties.
@highlight Arginine macroporous support showed to be effective on the sc p53 pDNA isolation.
@highlight The DBC achieved was 50 higher than its commercial homologous resin.
