@highlight The electromagnetic radiation force on a perfect electromagnetic conductor PEMC sphere is considered.
@highlight A linearly polarized plane wave illuminates the PEMC sphere.
@highlight The force is not affected by the admittance of the PEMC sphere material.
@highlight Scattering asymmetry parameters for the co polarized and cross polarized waves are derived and computed.
@highlight The results are important from the standpoint of the basics of the electromagnetic radiation force theory.
