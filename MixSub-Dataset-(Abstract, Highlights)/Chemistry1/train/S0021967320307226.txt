 Ionic liquids as tuneable highly soluble non flammable non volatile and reusable extractants have attracted extensive attention in the extraction of flavonoids from plants . In the present work novel dual chain imidazolium derived ionic liquids were synthesized by a simple and efficient method and characterized . Then the imidazolium ionic liquids with different cation were used in the microwave assisted extraction of flavonoids from
