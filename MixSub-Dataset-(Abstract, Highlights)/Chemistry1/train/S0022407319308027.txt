 Imprisonment of resonance radiation in the spherical barium plasma rotating around its symmetry axis is numerically studied . Photoexcitation of barium ions at resonance transition with the wavelength

@highlight Rotation of plasma leads to a broadening and a shift of the emission spectrum from the line center of the static medium to either red or blue spectral region.
@highlight At strong broadening of the spectral line resonant photons that would be locked in static plasma owing to reabsorption processes can now easily diffuse toward the plasma surface and escape the plasma.
@highlight The phenomenon of bandwidth expansion for resonant photons leads to escape of photons and to a decrease in effective lifetime of the excited level.
@highlight The presence of a velocity gradient dependent on the radius of the sphere leads to a spreading of the spectral line over a wider frequency range compared to the static emission spectrum.
