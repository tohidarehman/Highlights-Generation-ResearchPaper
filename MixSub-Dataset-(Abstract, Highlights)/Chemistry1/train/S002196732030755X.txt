 Separation of antipsychotic drugs from whole blood and urine is of great importance for clinic and forensic laboratories . In this work chlorprothixene haloperidol and risperidone representing the first and second generations of antipsychotic drugs were studied . Among them chlorprothixene and risperidone were investigated for the first time by electromembrane extraction . After the screening 2 nitrophenyl octyl ether was used as the supported liquid membrane . The EME performance for spiked water whole blood and urine was tested and optimized individually . Using NPOE and 60 V efficient EME was achieved from urine and whole blood with trifluoroacetic acid as the acceptor solution . The equilibrium time required for EME was dependent on the sample matrices . The steady state of EME was reached in 30 min and 20 min for whole blood and urine respectively . At steady state the EME recoveries of the targets from different sample matrices were satisfactory and were in the range of 74 100 . The proposed EME approach combined with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was evaluated using whole blood and urine . The obtained linearity was 1 200 ng mL

@highlight The antipsychotic drugs of CPX and RIS were extracted by EME for the first time.
@highlight Efficient EME of CPX HAL and RIS from whole blood and urine samples were achieved.
@highlight The proposed EME combined with LC MS MS was validated using biological samples.
@highlight EME LC MS MS was successfully applied to determine CPX HAL and RIS in rats.
