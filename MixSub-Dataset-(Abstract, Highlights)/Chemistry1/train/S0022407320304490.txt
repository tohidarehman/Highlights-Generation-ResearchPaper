 Due to attractive candidate for the laser application and searching for the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron mercury bromide is of much interest to researchers . However detailed information of the electronic structure of HgBr is still lacking especially for spin orbit interactions in excited states . In this work high level configuration interaction calculations of low lying states correlating to the lowest two dissociation limits Hg

@highlight The potential energies of 14 S states of HgBr are calculated by MRCI method.
@highlight The spin orbit coupling and 5d
@highlight correlation effects are included in the calculation.
@highlight Spectroscopic constants of bound states of HgBr are determined.
@highlight The predissociation mechanism of C
@highlight None
@highlight of HgBr are analyzed.
@highlight Radiative lifetimes of C
