 The halogen bond is a noncovalent interaction involving a halogen acting as electrophile and a Lewis base . In the last decades XB has found practical application in several fields . Nevertheless despite the pivotal role of noncovalent interactions in separation science investigations of XB in this field are still in their infancy and so far a limited number of studies focusing on solid phase extraction liquid liquid microextraction liquid phase chromatography and gas chromatography separation have been published . In addition in the last few years our groups have been systematically studying the potentiality of XB for HPLC enantioseparations . On this basis in the present paper up to date results emerging from focused experiments and theoretical analyses performed by our laboratories are integrated with a descriptive presentation of XB features and the few studies published until now in separation science . Then the aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive and critical discussion of the topic and account for some still open issues in the application of XB to separate chemical mixtures .
