 Esters of fruit acids including acetic acid and mono and diacylglycerols also known as E472 emulsifiers are used in the food industry as food additives to adjust techno functional properties like viscosity emulsion stability and foaming stability in various products mainly dairy products . Based on the respective acids E472 emulsifiers are classified in several categories with acetic acid esters lactic acid esters citric acid esters and mono and diacetyl tartaric acid esters as the most prominent representatives . Besides fruit acid esters E472 emulsifiers mainly comprise MAG DAG triacylglycerols free fatty acids free fruit acids and free glycerol in different amounts . Here we present an innovative and sensitive method for the characterization of the composition of E472 emulsifiers by high performance thin layer chromatography with fluorescence detection . For HPTLCFLD technical emulsifiers were simply dissolved and analyzed on HPTLC silica gel plates after a two fold development and derivatization with primuline enabling the easy characterization and direct visual comparison of the emulsifier pattern through the fluorescent lipid components under UV366nm . Thus the HPTLCFLD fingerprint approach represents a simple tool for the comparison of different samples batches and categories of E472 . Coupling of HPTLC to mass spectrometry moreover enabled the identification of constituents of interest .
