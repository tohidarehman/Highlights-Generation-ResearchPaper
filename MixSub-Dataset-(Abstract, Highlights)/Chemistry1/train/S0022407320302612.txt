 This study examines the application of the daytime mean and insolation weighted mean solar zenith angles to calculate the diurnally averaged aerosol direct radiative effect

@highlight Mean solar zenith angle for diurnal mean aerosol direct radiative effect DRE 
@highlight Aerosol DREs using the daytime mean solar zenith angle are too strong
@highlight Aerosol DREs using the insolation weighted mean solar zenith angle are too weak
@highlight An adjusted insolation weighted mean solar zenith angle is introduced
