 Downstream processing of large bionanoparticles is still a challenge . The present study aims to systematically compare some of the most commonly used DSP strategies for capture and purification of enveloped viruses and virus like particles by using the same staring material and analytical tools . As a model Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 gag VLPs produced in CHO cells were used . Four different DSP strategies were tested . An anion exchange monolith and a membrane adsorber for direct capture and purification of eVLPs and a polymer grafted anion exchange resin and a heparin affinity resin for eVLP purification after a first flow through step to remove small impurities . All tested strategies were suitable for capture and purification of eVLPs . The performance of the different strategies was evaluated regarding its binding capacity ability to separate different particle populations and product purity . The highest binding capacity regarding total particles was obtained using the anion exchange membrane adsorber 5.310

@highlight Systematic comparison of performance of common purification methods for eVLPs.
@highlight Chromatin and eVLPs have similar size distribution in NTA measurements.
@highlight Heparin affinity chromatography can separate eVLPs host vesicles and chromatin.
