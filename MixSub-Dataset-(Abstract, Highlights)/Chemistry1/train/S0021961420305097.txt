 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoropropene has been regarded as a promising alternative refrigerant and gained increasing interesting due to its environmental friendly properties . The introduction of HFO1234yf requires knowledge of the accurate thermophysical properties . The accurate speed of sound data is important for the improvement of the dedicated equations of state and the application in energy conversion system . The speed of sound in gaseous phase for HFO1234yf was measured by means of the acoustic resonance method using a fixed path cylindrical resonator . Measurements were conducted in the temperature range from 308K to 370K with pressures up to 1MPa . The speed of sound was obtained from the accurate measurements of acoustic resonant frequencies after being corrected for the perturbations from the viscous and thermal boundary layers the gas filling duct acoustic transducers and the shell motions . A total of 116 speed of sound data points were obtained with an expanded uncertainty less than 1.410
