 Thermodynamic properties of novel bio based deep eutectic solvents and their mixture with other solvents is of great importance in extraction and pharmaceutical sciences . In the present study new class of these neoteric sustainable solvents composed of amino acids and lactic acid have been prepared density and speed of sound data for neat lactic acid alanine lactic acid glycine and lactic acid histidine and their aqueous mixture have been measured over the entire composition range at

@highlight Some bio based DESs lactic acid amino acids were prepared.
@highlight Density and speed of sound of aqueous DES solutions were measured and reported.
@highlight The excess thermodynamic properties were calculated.
@highlight Redlich Kister equation was used to correlate excess quantities.
