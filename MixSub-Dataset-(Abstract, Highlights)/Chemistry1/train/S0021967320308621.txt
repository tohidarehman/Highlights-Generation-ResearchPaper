 Technetium poses an environmental hazard because of its radioactivity and long half life . It exists in the form of pertechnetate in the environment and can be modeled by the nonradioactive ion perrhenate since pertechnetate and perrhenate have the same geometry and similar chemical properties . In this research a new zinc cyclen resorcinarene cavitand column was used in ion chromatography to efficiently separate perrhenate . Ion chromatography has the advantage of requiring almost no sample preparation for water samples . The ZCR column demonstrated the ability to separate anions fluoride chloride nitrate sulfate phosphate perchlorate and perrhenate by gradient 260mM NaOH . Unlike other columns the new column material was selective in retaining perrhenate . The ZCR column also gave a linear range from 2.0 to 1000mg L
