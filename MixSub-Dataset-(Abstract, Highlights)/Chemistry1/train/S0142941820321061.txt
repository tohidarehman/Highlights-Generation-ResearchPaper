 There is remarkable interest in the fabrication of polymeric composite nano micro fibers by electrospinning for many applications ranging from bioengineering to water air filtration . In almost all of these applications the mechanical properties of both the polymer fibers and their assemblies are significant . In this study unmodified 3 Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane or 3 Aminopropyltriethoxysilane modified halloysite clay nanotube reinforced polycaprolactone nanofibers were successfully synthesized via the electrospinning . The morphology and mechanical features of the obtained electrospun fibers were investigated by atomic force microscopy and AFM based nanoindentation for single fibers in nanoscale respectively . Besides scanning electron microscopy and tensile strength tests were used to investigate whole fibrous structures in microscale . The AFMresults accompanied by
