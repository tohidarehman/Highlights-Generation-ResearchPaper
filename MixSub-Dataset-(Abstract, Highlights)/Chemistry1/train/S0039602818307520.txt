 As an alternative to a cluster expansion based set of lateral pair trio quarto interactions between Oxygen adatoms on Pd an analytical longer range elastic substrate mediated interaction with just 3 parameters is proposed to build a lattice gas Hamiltonian .

@highlight Elastic substrate mediated interaction is an alternative to cluster expansion parameters.
@highlight Only 3 parameters necessary.
@highlight Multisite interactions turn out to be marginal.
