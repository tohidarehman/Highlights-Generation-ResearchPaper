 New materials are currently being developed for applications in transformer design . With the useful life of transformers now determined by solid insulation conditions a better understanding of aging kinetics is important in order to improve electrical system management and planning from the technical and economic points of view . This paper summarizes an investigation of the effects of impregnating aramid and cellulose aramid papers with insulation fluids at thermally accelerated conditions on their mechanical properties .

@highlight Nomex 910 shows superior behaviour in terms of the retained percentage of tensile index when compared to TUK paper.
@highlight Measurement of the DP
@highlight of the cellulose inside the Nomex 910 was performed using a variant of the method used for Kraft.
@highlight A quasi linear curve between DP
@highlight and tensile strength was observed for the cellulose based paper including Nomex 910.
@highlight The same chemical markers used to track the aging of Kraft and TUK papers could be adapted and applied to Nomex 910.
@highlight Reduction in elongation over time of Nomex could be used as a tool to determine the state of insulation in transformers.
