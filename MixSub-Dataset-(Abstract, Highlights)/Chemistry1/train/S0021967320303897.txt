 A novel method for screening and quantification of illegal adulterated antidiabetics in hypoglycemic health products was developed by multi dimensional fingerprint profiling analysis . By means of aqueous two phase extraction using aqueous two phase system of butanol water as the extractant 11 common antidiabetics could be effectively extracted to the upper and lower phases respectively . HPLC separation conditions for the extracts from two phases were investigated by multi wavelength detection before and after p nitrobenzoyl chloride and 2 4 dinitrofluorobenzene derivatizations to establish multi dimensional fingerprints . For high accuracy and reliability a hierarchical screening approach to screening illegal adulterated antidiabetics in samples was established by MDFPA and spectral purity examination . Meanwhile detection limits of identification for illegal adulterants were defined by detection limits of spectra . The proposed method exhibited good identification and quantification performances . SLODs LODs and LOQs of 11 antidiabetics were 1.228.37 g g 0.2254.23 g g and 0.75514.10 g g respectively . They had good linearity ranged from 2.0g g to 300.0 g g R
