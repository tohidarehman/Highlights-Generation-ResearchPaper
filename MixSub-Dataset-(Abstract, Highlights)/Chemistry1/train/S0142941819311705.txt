 This work consists of the synthesis of high purity graphene nanoflakes the manufacturing of GNF epoxy nanocomposites and the mechanical characterization of the nanocomposite at high and quasi static strain rates . GNF were synthesized by using the electric arc discharge technique . Thermogravimetry Differential Thermal Analysis of synthesized graphene reveals high purity and high crystallinity . Raman spectra and the broad Brunauer Emmet Teller specific surface area indicate that the synthesized graphene has several layers . Following the solution mixing manufacturing process of GNF epoxy nanocomposites the influences of strain rate on the mechanical behaviors are investigated under quasi static and dynamic loadings . High strain rate uniaxial compression tests using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar and quasi static compression tests of GNF epoxy with two graphene contents are performed at room temperature . The maximum elasticity modulus achieved by the GNF epoxy with 0.5wt at the strain rate of 2350 s corresponds to a 68 increase compared to the neat epoxy . The yield strength of the material is doubled under dynamic loading conditions compared to the quasi static loading .
