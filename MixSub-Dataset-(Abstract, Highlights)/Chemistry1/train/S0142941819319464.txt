 High toughened polymeric materials have a wide application in many fields . Poly is a typical brittle polymer and it has been difficult to prepare high toughened PMMA material for a long time . To work on this issue co continuous phase structure was devised in PMMA chlorinated polyethylene blends through controlling the interfacial tension and viscosity in this work resulting in the pronounced enhancement of impact toughness . The notched impact strength of co continuous blends with 40wt CPE was up to 28.5kJ m

@highlight Co continuous phase structure was devised in PMMA CPE blends.
@highlight The impact strength of PMMA CPE blends was 26 times higher than that of pure PMMA.
@highlight Low interfacial tension and equal viscosity were main reason for phase formation.
@highlight Two toughening mechanisms i.e. cavitation and shear yielding were put forward.
@highlight This work provides a new strategy to prepare high toughed polymer materials.
