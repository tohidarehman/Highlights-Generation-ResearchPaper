 For separation of the azeotropic mixture isobutyl alcohol and isobutyl acetate liquid liquid extraction was adopted in this work and three imidazolium based ionic liquids with different anions 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium dihydrogen phosphate H

@highlight The LLE data for isobutyl acetate isobutyl alcohol ILs were measured and correlated by the NRTL model.
@highlight The distribution coefficient and selectivity were calculated.
@highlight The profiles and interaction energies were calculated to explore interaction ILs with isobutyl alcohol isobutyl acetate .
@highlight  Bmim H
@highlight PO
@highlight  is suitable as extractant to separate the azeotropic mixture IBA and IBAC.
