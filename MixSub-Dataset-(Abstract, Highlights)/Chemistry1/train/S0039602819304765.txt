 Hydrogen adsorption on the perfect Ir as well as the metastable and unreconstructed Ir and Ir surfaces up to saturation coverage has been systematically computed using periodic density functional theory and ab initio atomistic thermodynamics for understanding the interaction mechanism of hydrogen on iridium surfaces . On the Ir surface including van der Waals dispersion hydrogen adsorption prefers the threefold hollow sites at low coverage and the top sites at high coverage in agreement with the experiments 14016 . The computed adsorption energy and desorption temperature of hydrogen agree with the experiments 0.57
