 In this paper a lowcost rapid easy and potentially portable tool for the identification of cocaine and its semi quantitative determination in oral fluid has been proposed . A field collection device has been designed based on a cotton pad with an indicator and a molecularly imprinted polymer sorbent to selective retain cocaine from oral fluid components . After sample collection cocaine is transferred by using phosphate buffer to the MIP and then eluted with 2 propanol . The obtained extract is analysed by ion mobility spectrometry providing a cut off value of 20 g L

@highlight Low cost in field device for cocaine determination based on molecular imprinting.
@highlight Field device is made up of sample collector based on cotton and a MIP selective phase.
@highlight The method provides a cut off value of 20 g L
@highlight and a simple and fast handling.
@highlight Results are in agreement with those provided by LFIA and LLE GC MS.
