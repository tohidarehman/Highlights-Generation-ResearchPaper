 Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are essential omega 3 fatty acids in human nutrition . Dietary supplements containing these FA are available in the market and there is a need to assess their quality to prevent frauds . The purpose of this work was to optimize and validate a fast capillary electrophoresis method to determine EPA and DHA content in marine oils omega 3 supplements . Sample preparation comprised only a saponification step and analysis time was 8min . Validation was performed according to limits of detection and quantification linearity accuracy and repeatability . Ten real samples of marine oil supplements were analyzed by CE and compared to conventional gas chromatography method . No significant differences between both methods were found within 95 confidence interval . Overall CE method was successful to FA quantification and it could be used for fast FA monitoring during omega 3 supplement manufacture final product quality assurance and labelling .

@highlight A fast CE method was optimized and validated for omega 3 oil supplements.
@highlight Analysis was completed in just 8min requiring only a prior saponification step.
@highlight LOD LOQ linearity accuracy and repeatability tests were considered to validation.
@highlight No significant differences were found between this approach and classic method.
@highlight This fast simple and accurate method can be useful for routine quality control.
