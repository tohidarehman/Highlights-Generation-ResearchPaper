 The aim of this paper is to enhance the knowledge on the behaviour and thermodynamic properties of natural and synthetic biopolymers in aqueous solutions . The acid base properties of Carrageenan

@highlight The study improves the knowledge on the behaviour and thermodynamic properties of some biopolymers.
@highlight The variation of the constants in dependence on ionic strength has been modelled.
@highlight The binding ability of the polymers has been investigated towards Ca
@highlight  Zn
@highlight and Sn
@highlight The effect on the complexing ability of a secondary inorganic ligand has been evaluated.
@highlight The sequestering ability of the polymers towards the metal cations has been evaluated by the pL
