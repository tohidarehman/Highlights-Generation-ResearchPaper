 Surface tension of two binary mixtures of DMSO water and DMSOacetonitrile were measured over the whole range of composition at ambient pressure in the temperatures range between 298.15K and 328.15K . Surface tension deviations were calculated by using the experimental data . The values of for two binary systems are negative that reflect the strong hydrogen bonding between unlike components of mixtures . Surface tension data of the binary systems were correlated using Fu et al . Li et al . MyersScott WangChen and RedlichKister models . The mean value of standard deviation

@highlight Surface tension of DMSO with water and acetonitrile at different temperatures was measured.
@highlight The surface tension data of binary systems were correlated with five models.
@highlight The interaction energy between components were calculated.
@highlight DMSO acetonitrile system shows semi ideal behavior.
@highlight The surface mole fraction of DMSO increase with increasing temperature in water DMSO system.
