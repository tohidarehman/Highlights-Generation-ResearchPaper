 Low levels of inorganic arsenic and As in fishery products have been selectively isolated from fish extracts by ionic imprinted polymer based solid phase extraction procedure . The selective adsorbent was synthesized using sodium arsenite as a template 1 vinyl imidazole as a functional monomer divinylbenzene as a cross linker and 2 2 azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator . Optimized pre concentration conditions imply fish extract pH adjustment at 8.5 before loading flow rate of 0.25mL min

@highlight Selective determination of low concentrations of As III and As V in the presence of large concentrations of organoarsenic compounds.
@highlight Speciation of low concentrations of inorganic arsenic in fishery products.
@highlight Simple and low cost synthesis of ionic imprinted polymer for solid phase extraction.
