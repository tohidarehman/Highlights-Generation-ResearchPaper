 Microcystins and nodularin are tumor promoters produced by cyanobacteria and present in surface water . In this work a novel mesoporous metal organic

@highlight material was synthesized via a one step hydrothermal method.
@highlight This method approach showed advantages of short adsorption time.
@highlight The sensitivity of the method for nodularin was improved nearly 30 times.
@highlight The method was applied to analyze microcystins and nodularin in water samples.
