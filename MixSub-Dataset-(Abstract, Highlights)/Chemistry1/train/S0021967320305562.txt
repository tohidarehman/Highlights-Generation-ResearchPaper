 A fast non invasive high performance liquid chromatographic screening method with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was developed for the analysis of three major glycine conjugated bile acids in human saliva . Using a mobile phase composed of 80 methanol and 0.1 formic acid glycocholic glycodeoxycholic and glycochenodeoxycholic acids were separated in less than 4 minutes with sensitivity in the low nM range . Bile acids are thought to contribute to the pathology of various complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease for instance Barrett s esophagus which may eventually lead to esophageal carcinoma . In this pilot study samples of saliva obtained from 15 patients with Barrett s esophagus of various severities were compared to saliva samples from 10 healthy volunteers . Glycochenodeoxycholic acid was significantly elevated in the patients and principal component analysis of all bile acids could distinguish the most severe Barrett s esophagus patients . We also reported on the detection of glycochenodeoxycholic acid in exhaled breath condensate for the first time . The promising results of this pilot study warrant future investigation aiming at non invasive diagnostics of Barrett s esophagus susceptibility in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease .
