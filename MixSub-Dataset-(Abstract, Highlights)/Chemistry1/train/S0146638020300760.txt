 Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers have proven useful for paleoclimate reconstructions . Nevertheless the mechanism by which these biomarkers respond to the environment and the identity of the source organisms remain poorly understood . These gaps in knowledge have prevented the study of brGDGTs in culture thereby limiting the use of these molecules as a tool for paleoclimate reconstruction . In this work we used controlled microcosms to study the effect of temperature and pH on brGDGTs in lake water . Our results show that temperature has a strong influence on the production of brGDGTs with a sensitivity that is similar to empirical observations . In contrast the pH experiments yielded inconclusive results either due to a limited response or to the experimental set up . This study demonstrates that the brGDGT response to temperature can be replicated under controlled conditions establishing that microcosms are a viable strategy to better understand the proxy response mechanism .

@highlight Temperature strongly influences brGDGT production under controlled conditions.
@highlight We find inconclusive evidence of pH affecting the production of brGDGTs.
@highlight Response under laboratory conditions matches that observed in empirical studies.
