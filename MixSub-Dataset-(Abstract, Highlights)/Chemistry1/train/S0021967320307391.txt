 Cross reactivity is an important feature of molecularly imprinted polymers and is central to successful use of a pseudo template in molecular imprinting . The adsorption and cross reactivity of a molecularly imprinted polymer designed for recognition of phenols from water was assessed using four different isotherm models Freundlich LangmuirFreundlich and Brunauer Emmett and Teller . The L FI model succeeded in explaining the cross reactivity behavior through the total number of binding sites the affinity constants and heterogeneity indices of the small phenols 2 methylphenol 3 methylphenol 2 chlorophenol 2 4 dimethylphenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 4 chloro 3 methylphenol with evidence that the phenols compete for binding sites based on their hydrophobicity as well as and dipole dipole intermolecular forces . The recognition of the large phenols pentachlorophenol 4 teroctylphenol 4 nonylphenol which have much higher binding affinities than the smaller phenolic compounds was explained with the BET isotherm model that predicts that multiple layers adsorb to the adsorbed monolayer . The adsorption behavior with MIPs is also shown to be superior to corresponding non imprinted polymers and applicability of MIPs for trace analysis is highlighted .
