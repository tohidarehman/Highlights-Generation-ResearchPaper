 Analysis of fatty acids in the form of fatty acid methyl esters using gas chromatography is routine within microbiology but still some compounds remain unidentified . During characterization of the FAMEs of two strains of the microaerophilic bacterium

@highlight A series of unusual compounds were detected
@highlight sp. during FAME analysis.
@highlight These had amino acid glycine linked via an amide bond to hydroxy fatty acid.
@highlight The glycine hydroxy fatty acid amides are derived from glycine lipids.
@highlight A rapid way to detect the presence of glycine lipids during routine FAME analysis.
