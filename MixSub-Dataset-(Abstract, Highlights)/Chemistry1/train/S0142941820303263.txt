 Biodegradable poly is regarded as one of the most promising biopolymers with large market potential but its applications are limited by the poor mechanical properties since PLA is rigid and brittle . To enhance its mechanical thermal and processability properties at this study the authors use small molecules maleic acid and its propyl ester derivatives monopropyl maleate and dipropyl maleate as alternative plasticizers . The morphological thermal and mechanical properties of plasticized PLA were evaluated by DSC FTIR

@highlight Mono and dipropyl maleate induced the plasticization of PLA films.
@highlight NMR and FTIR indicated water absorption by the PLA films plasticized with MA and MPM.
@highlight The presence of water into the PLA bulk promoted MPM hydrolysis.
@highlight PLA DPM samples exhibited a second elastic region after 20 deformation.
@highlight PLA DPM films demonstrated chain alignment and light polarization after stretched.
