 Trapping multiple dual mode is a preparative liquid liquid chromatography technique well suited to difficult separations of intermediately eluting components from similarly structured impurities . In this demonstrative study a design approach for high process throughput is applied for the trapping MDM separation of a target component nootkatone initially comprising 16.7 of an industrial side stream mixture with over 90 impurities . This design approach previously developed and validated using ternary mixtures of model solutes is applied to a complex real mixture for the first time . The approach consists of five steps determination of the maximum starting mixture concentration for feed preparation determination of the maximum flow rate for maintenance of the pre set stationary phase fraction determination of the partition coefficients of the target and main impurities selection of step durations and number of cycles using an established short cut method execution of the trapping MDM separation . The target NK was obtained along with a co eluting component at 78.7 purity and 84.6 yield demonstrating the effectiveness of trapping MDM for the separation of intermediately eluting natural product target components from complex starting mixtures .
