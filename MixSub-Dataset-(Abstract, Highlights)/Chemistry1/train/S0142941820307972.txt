 Water holding capacity becomes essential for hygiene applications including baby diapers . Microfibers of hydrophilic polymers have been useful source for such applications . While super hydrophilic and stable nanofibers incorporation with functional antibacterial agent are essential to get higher absorption of water along with antimicrobial activity against harmful bacteria . In current work hydrophobic polymeric nanofibers are transformed to super hydrophilic nanofibers by addition of copper oxide nanoparticles . CuO nanoparticles provided two distinctive properties to existing nanofibers . Firstly nanofibers surface area was significantly increased and secondly copper oxide itself is hydrophilic material which imparted hydrophilicity to base polymer . Polyacrylonitrile crosslinked Polyvinyl Alcohol and PICT were selected as super hydrophobic polymeric nanofibers . Copper II oxide nanoparticles were added in all polymer solution and electrospun . Surface morphological and hydrophilic properties were characterized and it was concluded that copper II oxide is suitable for transforming hydrophobic nanofibers to super hydrophilic nanofibers . Water holding capacity was also improved for all prepared nanofiber mats . WHC for PVA CuO PAN CuO and PICT CuO were recorded an average of 23g g 21g g and 18g g respectively . Combining all useful results from possible characterization of nanofiber mats it is expected that CuO nanoparticles loaded nanofibers will have potential application as antibacterial sustainable and stable replacement of hygiene products .
