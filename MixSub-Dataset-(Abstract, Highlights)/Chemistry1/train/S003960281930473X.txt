 In a combined scanning tunneling microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy study the internal atomic structure of terbium silicide nanowires on Si capped with silicon is determined . Room temperature capping by amorphous silicon preserves the original nanowire structure and the nanowires with a usual height of two silicide layers are found to consist of hexagonal TbSi
