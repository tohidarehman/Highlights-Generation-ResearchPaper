 Accurate and concise constitutive model of biaxial tensile behavior is urgently needed for the analysis of complex membrane structure engineering . A new constitutive model is developed to describe the tensile behaviors of coated fabrics from pre tension to breaking . The shrinkage curve is employed for the first time and stress ratio dependence coefficient is proposed to represent the proportion of elongation and shrinkage in biaxial monotonic tensile test . The deformation of cruciform specimen is considered as the result of the coupling effect of biaxial tension and Poisson effect . Excellent fitting results were obtained between the data points of biaxial tensile test and stress stress strain response surface which R squares of both warp and weft response surface were 0.995 .
