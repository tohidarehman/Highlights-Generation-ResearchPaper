 Poly has properties suitable for many applications . However PLA s properties are affected by environmental conditions . In this study the glass rubber transition temperatures

@highlight in situ immersion and post immersion T
@highlight values were different.
@highlight in situ T
@highlight reduction varied by alcohol sizes and concentrations.
@highlight Smaller aliphatic alcohols induced larger T
@highlight reduction.
@highlight Solubility and interaction parameters could be used to predict T
@highlight reduction.
