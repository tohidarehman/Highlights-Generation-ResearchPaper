 Here the epitaxial growth of Co on Ru at the ultrathin limit is revisited in order to explore the stabilization of CoRu surface alloy nanostructures . By using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy surface morphology after deposition of Co at different temperatures on a stepped Ru substrate were investigated . The experimental results indicated a dependence of the growth mode of Co on Ru on the deposition temperature and surface step density of substrate . Additionally it was observed the stabilization of an ordered surface alloy made out of two bulk immiscible elements Co and Ru at the step edges of the substrate . Spin polarized STM analysis of the regions identified as CoRu surface alloying revealed perpendicular magnetic anisotropy .

@highlight Immiscible in bulk Co and Ru can form atomically ordered surface alloy nanostructures.
@highlight CoRu surface alloy nanostructures present perpendicular magnetic anisotropy PMA as probed by spin polarized scanning tunneling microscopy SP STM .
@highlight The Combination of Co dosing step density and deposition temperature can determine the growth mode and be used to tailor nanostructures in the form of nanoribbons or nanoislands.
