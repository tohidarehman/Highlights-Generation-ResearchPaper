 Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers have been widely used to elucidate sources of sediment total organic carbon past temperature and presence of methanogenesis in diverse environments . However their applicability to hadal trenches with their unique deposition dynamics remains unknown . Here we analyzed GDGTs and their stable isotope values and content of TOC in surface sediments from the Kermadec Trench region New Britain Trench region and Atacama Trench region . These regions are at very different distances from terrestrial sources and have varying net primary productivity in the waters above them . The GDGT concentration was highly variable 54.52416gg

@highlight IsoGDGTs are the dominant components of GDGTs in three trench regions.
@highlight There are trench specific characteristics and heterogeneity for GDGTs.
@highlight TEX
@highlight  derived temperature is consistent with in situ SST in three trench regions.
