 Silicone polymers have enormous applications especially in the areas of biomedical engineering . Ecoflex a commercially available room temperature cured silicone polymer has attracted considerable attention due to its wide range of applications as medical grade silicones and as matrix materials in producing nano filled stretchable sensors and dielectric elastomers for soft robotics . In this contribution we have conducted a wide range of experiments under thermo mechanical loadings . These experiments consist of loadingunloading cyclic tests single step relaxation tests Mullins effects tests at different strain rates and stretches stress recovery tests at different rest time etc . In order to assess the temperature influences on Ecoflex a number of viscoelastic tests are performed in a thermal chamber with temperature ranging from 40

@highlight A thorough experimental characterization of Ecoflex polymer.
@highlight Strain rate and temperature influences are analysed.
@highlight Stress softening and recovery behaviour have been identified.
@highlight Ecoflex shows minimum viscoelastic dissipative behaviour.
@highlight Stress relaxation of Ecoflex lasts for more than twelve hours.
