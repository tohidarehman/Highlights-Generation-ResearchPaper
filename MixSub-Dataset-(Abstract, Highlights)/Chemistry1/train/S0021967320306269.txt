 Solid phase extraction is a widely used and very well established sample preparation technique for liquid samples . An area of on going focus for innovation in this field concerns the development of new and improved SPE sorbents that can enhance the sensitivity and or the selectivity of SPE processes . In this context mixed mode ion exchange sorbents have been developed and commercialised thereby allowing enhanced capacity and selectivity to be offered by one single material . The ion selectivity of these materials is such that either anion exchange or cation exchange is possible however one limitation to their use is that more than one sorbent type is required to capture both anions and cations . In this paper we disclose the design synthesis and exploitation of a novel SPE sorbent based on microporous polymer microspheres with amphoteric character . We show that it is possible to switch the ion exchange retention mechanism of the sorbent simply by changing the pH of the loading solution anion exchange dominates at low pH cation exchange dominates at high pH and both mechanisms can contribute to retention when the polymer bound amphoteric species which are based on the amino acid sarcosine
