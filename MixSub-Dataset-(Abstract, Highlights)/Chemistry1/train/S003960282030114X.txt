 Stable organic radicals serve as model systems for investigating metal free magnetic phenomena at nanometer length scales . We have investigated at the single molecule level the stable

@highlight We provide single molecule data of archetypal pi radical DPPH on Au 111 .
@highlight We report energies and orbital maps of frontier orbital related electronic states.
@highlight Kondo like state changes between peak and dip depending on tip position.
