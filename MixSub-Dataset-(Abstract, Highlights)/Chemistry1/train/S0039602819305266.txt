 Having single atoms or small clusters docked onto a single layer graphene represents a charming feature for energy storage and catalysis . Unfortunately the large cohesion energy of transition metals often prevents the isolation of nanoscopic clusters which invariably tend to aggregate . The decoration of defective graphene layers with single Pt atoms and sub nanometric clusters is herein achieved by exploiting metal carbonyl clusters as precursor and investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy and X ray photoemission spectroscopy . Unexpectedly the process of aggregation of Pt into larger clusters is inhibited onto the surface of defective graphene where the Pt clusters are found to fragment even into single metal atoms .

@highlight Novel method for Pt decoration of defective graphene using metal carbonyl clusters is described.
@highlight Pt cluster decomposition is observed on the graphene surface already at room temperature.
@highlight Defects on graphene layer allow the cluster fragmentation even into single metal atoms preventing aggregation.
@highlight Easy scalability of the preparation suitable for applications.
