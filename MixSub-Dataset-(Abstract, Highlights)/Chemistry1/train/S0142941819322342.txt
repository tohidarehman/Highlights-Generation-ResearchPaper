 In this article we present the research on the influence of the composition of thin films of a blend of poly P3HT with fullerene derivatives phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester PC70BM and phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester PC60BM on their thermal transitions . The influence of molar mass of P3HT and PCBM is examined in details . The article presents significantly expanded research compared to our previous work on thermal transitions in thin films of blend P3HT with PC60BM . For this reason we also compare current results with previous ones . Here we present for the first time a phase diagram of thin films of the P3HT PC70BM blend using variable temperature ellipsometry . Our research reveals the presence of characteristic temperatures of pure phases in thin films of P3HT PCBM blends . It turns out that the cold crystallization temperature of the P3HT phase in P3HT PC70BM blend films is lower than corresponding temperature in P3HT PC60BM blend films . At the same time the cold crystallization temperature of the PC70BM phase behaves inversely . We demonstrate also that variable temperature spectroscopic ellipsometry is a very sensitive technique for studying thermal transitions in these thin films . In addition we show that the entire phase diagram can be determined based on the raw ellipsometric data analysis e.g . using a delta angle at wavelength
