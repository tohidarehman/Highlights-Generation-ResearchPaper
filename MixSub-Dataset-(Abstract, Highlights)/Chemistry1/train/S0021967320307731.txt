 A green air assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction based on floating organic droplet solidification was introduced for the enrichment of five endocrine disrupting compounds from water using a ternary deep eutectic solvent as an extracting solvent prior to their determination by HPLC PDA . The eutectic solvents were synthesized by combining various fatty acids which can concurrently act as both hydrogen bond acceptors and hydrogen bond donors . Adding a third component to classical two component eutectic solvents allows to purposefully control density melting point and viscosity of the synthesized solvents . Ternary and binary eutectic solvents with C9 acid provided excellent extraction efficiency in comparison with other eutectic solvents with C8 acid while ternary solvents provided superior extraction efficiency to binary ones . Different variables that could influence the microextraction efficiency were optimized applying central composite face centered design . At the optimum conditions the method had low detection limits ranging from 0.962.30g L with a preconcentration up to 134 folds . The method showed good linearity from the linear regression with an excellent correlation coefficient
