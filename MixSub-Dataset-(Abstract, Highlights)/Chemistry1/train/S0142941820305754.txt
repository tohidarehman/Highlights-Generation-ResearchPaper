 Polystyrene graphene nanoplatelets and polystyrene multi walled carbon nanotube nanocomposites were prepared through solution mixing processing . The effect of carbon filler doping on the DC AC electrical conductivity dielectric characteristics and optical parameters absorption coefficient

@highlight PS GNP and PS MWCNT nanocomposites were prepared by simple and efficient solution mixing and ultrasonic method.
@highlight The effect of CF doping on the physical properties of nanocomposites were investigated and compared.
@highlight Calculated the critical exponents indicate that CFs create three dimensional CF network in PS matrix.
@highlight The presence of CFs significantly enhanced the capacitive charge storage capabilities of the nanocomposites.
@highlight The optical band gap energies of PS CF nanocomposites decreased with increasing CF doping..
