 Herbal liqueurs are a large group of diverse alcoholic beverages with an ancient tradition produced by maceration of various herbs and spices and are commonly drunken before or after a meal to aid in the digestion because of their potential functional properties . In the presented work eight different commercial herbal liqueurs were investigated with regard to their composition of phenolic compounds by liquid chromatography ion mobility quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry . This multidimensional analytical platform uses all ion fragmentation for a deep coverage of the foodome . After an extensive data clean up 3225 features were found . 213 features were manually annotated due to the absence of databases and software tools able to consider the drift time or Collison Cross Section together with high resolution MS MS spectra for identification . The identified compounds reflected the large variance between the investigated samples and a wealth of potential bioactive compounds that these liqueurs harbor .

@highlight A LC ion mobility method with high resolution mass spectrometry is presented for the analysis of herbal liqueurs.
@highlight 171 compounds were identified in the samples by tandem mass spectrometry and collision cross section CCS .
@highlight Isobaric phenolic compounds were separated by ion mobility.
@highlight The profile of known compounds allowing to distinguish between different herbal liqueurs.
