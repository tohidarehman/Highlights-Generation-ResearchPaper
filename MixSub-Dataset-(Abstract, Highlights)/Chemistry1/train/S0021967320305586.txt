 Polysaccharide based chiral stationary phases are outstandingly suitable to play a key role in chiral HPLC method selection strategies since they provide high success rates . One reason for this ability is that they adopt a diversity of higher order structures in various eluents resulting in versatile chiral environments .

@highlight Polar organic mode chiral screening sequence was designed with a novel approach.
@highlight Methods using alcohol ratios resulting in history dependent retentions were included.
@highlight The multiple states of the selector can address needs of pharmaceutical analysis.
@highlight The proposed strategy combines versatility with practical simplicity.
