 Diethylamine ethyl acetate and triethylamine are usually applied to synthesize an important flame retardant of vinylphosphorus which has high ability to retard flames low toxic content and good washing durability . The isobaric VLE data of and system were determined at 101.3kPa for industrial separation . A minimum azeotrope was discovered at

@highlight Determine the VLE data of the unknown system molecular dynamics analysis.
@highlight In our preliminary experiments we found that ethyl acetate and triethylamine had the lowest azeotrope and it was difficult to obtain high purity ethyl acetate from the reactive system.
@highlight When the liquid molar fraction of diethylamine is greater than 0.4687 the azeotrope of the ethyl acetate triethylamine system can be eliminated.
@highlight The molecular dynamics method was used to analyze the reason why the azeotropic point disappeared. The results showed that the van der Waals effect and electrostatic effect around ethyl acetate after the addition of diethylamine were the main reasons for the disappearance of the azeotropic point of the ethyl acetate triethylamine system.
