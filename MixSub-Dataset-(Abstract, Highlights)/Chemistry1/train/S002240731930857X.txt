 The Chebyshev collocation spectral method is developed for solving the vector radiative transfer equation in participating media and then extended to polarized radiative transfer problems in two layered media . The derivation of the CCSM discretization for the VRTE is presented and the numerical performance of the CCSM is investigated . The accuracy of the CCSM for solving the VRTE is first verified by comparing the CCSM solutions for the polarized radiative transfer in a plane parallel medium with published results . Afterward the CCSM is applied to polarized radiative transfer problems in inhomogeneous media including two layered media with different scattering characteristics and two layered media with different refractive indices . Finally taking both effects of different medium properties and reflective refractive interface into account we investigated the polarized radiative transfer in a realistic atmosphere ocean system via the CCSM and discussed the distributions of the Stokes vector components . Results show that the CCSM is accurate and efficient for solving the VRTE and the distributions of Stokes vector for a realistic atmosphere ocean system are presented in detail .
