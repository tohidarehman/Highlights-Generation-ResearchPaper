 Amino acids are most often analyzed in reversed phase liquid chromatography after a derivatization procedure to render them sufficiently hydrophobic and detectable with UV or fluorimetric detection . Simpler methods should be possible to avoid additional chemical reactions . We present an improved method to analyze free amino acids with unified chromatography that is to say with a wide elution gradient starting with supercritical fluid chromatography conditions and ending with high performance liquid chromatography conditions . The mobile phase composition was carefully adjusted to permit the elution of 21 natural amino acids with very good peak shapes from a zwitterionic cinchona based stationary phase . Chiral separation was not desired . The mobile phase finally selected comprised carbon dioxide and a co solvent ranging from 10 to 100 in 7min followed by 3min re equilibration at 25C . A reversed pressure gradient and a reversed flow rate gradient were applied to avoid reaching the upper pressure limit of the pumping system and to favor high chromatographic efficiency at every stage of the elution gradient . Detection was achieved with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry MS . The method is then fast and straightforward as no derivatization step is necessary and all isobaric species were chromatographically resolved .
