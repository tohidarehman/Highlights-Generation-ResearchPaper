 The enormous growth in drug discovery paradigm has necessitated continuous exploration of new methods for drug protein interaction analysis . To enhance the role of these methodologies in designing rational drugs this work extended an immobilized angiotensin II type I receptor AT

@highlight Immobilized AT
@highlight R chromatography was prepared by a one step method.
@highlight Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of four ARBs have been measured by injection amount dependent method and peak profiling method.
@highlight The hit identification of puerarin and rosmarinic acid has been evaluated by the immobilized AT
@highlight R chromatography.
