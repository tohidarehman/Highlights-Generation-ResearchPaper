 The key factors in the design of nanocomposites include obtaining a good adhesion between components and homogeneous dispersion of the nanoadditive in the polymer matrix . Direct mixing of graphene with polymers which are then processed by melt compounding method results in strong tendency of nanoadditive to agglomerate . The article presents a new approach to obtaining poly graphene nanocomposites in the form of fibers . This method is characterized by the use of graphene oxide dispersed in the plasticizer instead of graphene . The combination of the fibers forming process with simultaneous reduction of GO to rGO allowed the authors to obtain nanocomposites with graphene homogeneously dispersed in the polymer matrix . Moreover addition of graphene resulted in formation of phase in the nanocomposites which is characteristic for PVDF and responsible for pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties of this polymer .

@highlight The PVDF fibers preparation processing temperature provided the partial reduction of graphene oxide to graphene.
@highlight The conditions of nanocomposites preparation allowed to obtain the homogeneous dispersion of the rGO in the polymer matrix.
@highlight The addition of reduced graphene oxide into PVDF influenced the content of phase in the nanocomposites.
@highlight The increase in take up velocity during fibers formation causes an increase in the contents of the phase.
@highlight The appropriate processing conditions facilitated obtaining nanocomposite with better mechanical properties than pure PVDF.
