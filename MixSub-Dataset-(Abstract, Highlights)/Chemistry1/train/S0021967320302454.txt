 The aim of the present study was to compare the enantioseparation performance of chiral stationary phases which were derived from chitosans of different sources and molecular weights . Therefore chitosans of shrimp and crab shells were prepared . The viscosity average molecular weights of the chitosans both prepared from shrimp and crab shells were 2.810

@highlight The enantioseparation of shrimp crab chitosan derivatives with 4 Me was studied.
@highlight The CSPs prepared from shrimp chitosan showed a little better separation ability.
@highlight The CSPs derived from molecular weight MW higher chitosans had better performance.
@highlight The trend between performance and MW was influenced by the substituent on CSPs.
