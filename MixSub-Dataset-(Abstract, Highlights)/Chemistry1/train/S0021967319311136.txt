 A novel restricted access media magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers was prepared as magnetic solid phase extraction material for tetracyclines . The RAM MMIPs can not only specifically adsorb target molecules in samples but also effectively eliminate the interference of protein macromolecules . The protein exclusion rate is 99.4 . Besides RAM MMIPs have a uniform imprinted and hydrophilic layer rapid binding kinetic high selectivity and larger adsorption capacity . The M SPE was coupled with HPLC UV to extract TCs from untreated milk and egg samples and several major factors affecting M SPE efficiency were optimized . Under optimized conditions the developed method achieved good linearity R

@highlight RAM MMIPs were prepared as M SPE material for selective extraction of trace TCs.
@highlight RAM MMIPs possess satisfactory protein exclusion properties.
@highlight The method extract TCs directly from untreated milk and eggs successfully.
