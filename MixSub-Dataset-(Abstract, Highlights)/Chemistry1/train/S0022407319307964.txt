 A Symbolic Monte Carlo method is applied to the identification of radiative properties of a heterogeneous semitransparent insulating material from measurements of directional hemispherical transmittance and reflectance at room temperature . The polynomials obtained with SMC allow the development of a complete inverse analysis which determines if the inverse problem solution exists is unique and stable . Moreover the numerical efficiency of the absorption and scattering coefficients identification is improved since the radiative transfer equation is only solved once in the overall inverse iterative procedure .

@highlight Symbolic Monte Carlo method is applied for the identification of radiative properties of an insulating material.
@highlight An inverse analysis based on SMC polynomials determines if the inverse problem is well or ill posed.
@highlight SMC polynomials allows to decrease significantly the computational cost of the inverse method.
