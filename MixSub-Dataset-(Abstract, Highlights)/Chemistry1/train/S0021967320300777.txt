 During a microbial fermentation process the chemical composition of Fu brick tea changed substantially . To better profile the unique changes of metabolites and lipids in Fu brick tea at different fermentation stages a multifaceted strategy combining untargeted foodomics with UHPLC Q Orbitrap analysis was developed . The discriminative tea metabolites and lipids were determined by statistical analysis and online database matching . A total of 12 characteristic components were found to differ significantly among samples . Quantitative analysis showed that except for trimyristin and incensole acetate the content of these compounds gradually increased and finally stabilized with increasing fermentation time . The simultaneous determination of metabolites and lipids in this study provided detailed information for the analysis of multi component changes in a complex matrix .

@highlight Untargeted foodomics method enables both metabolites and lipids characterization.
@highlight A variable data independent acquisition strategy was developed.
@highlight Chemical component differences in distinct fermentation stages were analyzed.
@highlight Dynamic changes during fermentation of Fu brick tea were revealed.
@highlight The method was suitable to multi components profiling in complex matrix.
