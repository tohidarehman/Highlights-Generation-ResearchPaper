 Earth s atmosphere contains interplanetary dust particles which are a key ingredient to understand planetary phenomena yet the study of their physicochemical properties without external interferences at the single particle level is limited . With the optical trapping technique a single dust particle can be stably trapped in air for subsequent characterization . We report on measurements of the single particle extinction of trapped particles using cavity ringdown spectroscopy at ultraviolet wavelength around 308nm . We also present Raman spectral features of chemical groups in individually trapped particles . Two simulants of extraterrestrial materials along with carbon spheres and volcanic ashes were trapped and spectroscopically characterized . In addition to the on trap measurements the particles morphological and mineralogical information was obtained from off trap measurements using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy . This study demonstrates that the integration of OT with cavity ringdown and Raman spectroscopy provides a new tool to gain multimodal information on the physicochemical properties of single IDPs with minimum to no external interferences .
