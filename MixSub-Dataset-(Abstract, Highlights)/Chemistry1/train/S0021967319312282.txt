 The aim of this study was to estimate the retention time variability under reproducible conditions of an SFC MS analytical method for routine anti doping analyses . For this purpose a set of 51 doping agents as neat standards and spiked in diluted urine was used to assess their retention times variability over a period of four months as well as the column

@highlight Evaluation of retention times variability in SFC MS in neat standards and urine.
@highlight Three UHPSFC stationary phases were tested under a period of four months.
@highlight RSD values 1.5 were obtained on two UHPSFC stationary phases after four months.
@highlight Column inter batch variability was also excellent RSD 2 .
