 Confined pyrolysis experiments quantitative flash pyrolysis gas chromatography and Rock Eval analysis were performed on ten coals from the Junggar Basin and seven coals from the Kuqa Depression Tarim Basin northwestern China . The maximum yields of liquid components in confined pyrolysis experimnets MCPC

@highlight Confined pyrolysis CP and Py GC were performed on coals.
@highlight Oil yields from CP on coals correlate well to
@highlight  alkane ene yields from Py GC.
@highlight Oil yields from CP on coals correlate poorly to Rock Eval QI.
@highlight Liquid yields from Py GC on coals correlate poorly to Rock Eval QI.
