 The applicability of capillary zone electrophoresis for the separation of the deamidated forms of insulin has been studied . 50 mM NH

@highlight CE method was developed for determination of the deamidation isoforms of insulin.
@highlight 10 deamidated forms were separated and identified with CE MS.
@highlight MS detection made the determination of the exact mass of the isoforms possible.
@highlight The method was applied for monitoring the degradation of the insulin.
@highlight In the acidified insulin solution more than 30 components could be separated.
