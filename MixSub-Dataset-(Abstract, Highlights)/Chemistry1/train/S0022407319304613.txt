 We present a hybrid radiative transfer geometric optics approximation to model multiple light scattering in arbitrary finite discrete random media in the geometric optics regime . In the hybrid model the medium is divided into a mantle composed of discrete particles and into a diffusely scattering core . In the mantle multiple scattering is handled by using a ray tracing algorithm with the generalized Snels law for inhomogeneous waves whereas in the core ray tracing with diffuse scatterers is incorporated to approximate multiple scattering and absorption . The extinction distances required to compute the scattering in the core are derived numerically by tracing the distances of the scattering and absorption events instead of using the classical extinction mean free path length . We have written a new framework that can treat arbitrary meshes consisting of watertight surface meshes with multiple diffuse scatterers and refractive indices . Comparison between the ground truth obtained from pure geometric optics ray tracing the solutions obtained by using radiative transfer and the hybrid model show that the hybrid model can produce better results particularly if a densely packed medium is studied . In the future the new approximation could be used to solve light scattering from larger media such as asteroid surfaces that are out of reach for the pure geometric optics methods due to their computational complexity .

@highlight Modelling can be improved by mixing the geometric optics and the radiative transfer.
@highlight Extinction distances improve the phase function but not that well the other scattering elements.
@highlight Surface structure is mandatory for a densely packed medium.
