 Vigorously developing new high performance liquid chromatography stationary phases to meet the versatile separation requirements is still an important issue in the field of analytical chemistry . Conjugated microporous polymers are a new type of three dimensional network porous material with high specific surface area good chemical stability and superhydrophobicity . Herein we firstly report the synthesis and applications of

@highlight The
@highlight materials were synthesized via sonogashira coupling.
@highlight The
@highlight materials exhibit superhydrophobic nature.
@highlight The packed
@highlight column was used for monitor the quality of cooking oils.
