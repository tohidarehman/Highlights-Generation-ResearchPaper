 Dissolved organic matter is one of the key carbon substrates transported by rivers from land to sea yet only a small fraction of it has been characterized at the molecular level . Here we characterize high molecular weight DOM isolated by ultrafiltration from nine North American rivers using thermal slicing ramped pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes elemental composition and total hydrolyzable amino acids . Samples from the more anthropogenically altered watersheds carried more enriched

@highlight High molecular weight DOM from nine northern American rivers was collected.
@highlight Samples were analyzed by thermal slicing ramped pyrolysis and other techniques.
@highlight Degradation of samples was quantified by totally hydrolyzable amino acids.
@highlight More developed watersheds carried more enriched
@highlight N HMW DOM signatures.
@highlight With degradation HMW DOM became less diverse compositionally.
