 In this study a reliable and novel coupling of pipette tip micro solid phase extraction with corona discharge ionization ion mobility spectrometry was developed for on site fast detection of benzodiazepines in dietary supplements . The poly monoliths fabricated in pipette tips through an in situ polycondensation reaction . The extraction procedure of PT SPE for aqueous sample was performed for an appropriate number of aspirating dispensing cycles by using a manual micropipettor . Then analytes retained in the polymeric monoliths were eluted with elution solvents by repeating the aspirating dispensing cycles and the eluates were analyzed by CD IMS . In order to find the best extraction conditions several parameters such as the number of aspirating dispensing cycles for extraction and desorption pH elution solvent amount of polymer and ionic strength were investigated . Under the optimal conditions the LOD of this method was in the range of 515ngmL

@highlight PT SPE was coupled with CD IMS for the first time.
@highlight In tip poly St DVB monolith was used for extraction BZDs in dietary supplements.
@highlight High throughput sampling can be achieved by using multichannel pipettor.
@highlight The method has potential for on site environmental and public security monitoring.
