 Accurate quantitation of aldosterone is critical for the clinical detection of hypertension . However no reference intervals for aldosterone in healthy volunteers and patients with hypertension have yet been established using highly sensitive methods with a wide linear range based on low plasma volumes . We developed a modified ultra performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitation of aldosterone and established reference intervals for healthy volunteers and patients with hypertension . We measured aldosterone by UPLCMS MS in human plasma samples . We established a reference range for aldosterone based on blood collected midmorning from 888 patients with hypertension and 258 seated normotensive subjects . The linear range was 105000pg mL

@highlight Reference intervals of aldosterone for healthy volunteers were established.
@highlight Aldosterone levels in 888 hypertensive patients were measured.
@highlight We prepared samples with 90L plasma and measured aldosterone using UPLCMS MS.
@highlight Our UPLCMS MS method had higher sensitivity and wider linear range.
