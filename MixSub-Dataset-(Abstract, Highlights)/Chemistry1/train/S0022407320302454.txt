 In this work the hyperfine structure of 26 even parity levels of the manganese atom was investigated with the method of laser induced fluorescence on an atomic beam . Altogether 47 spectral lines were examined with the even parity levels involved as the lower levels . For three levels both the constants

@highlight Hyperfine structure hfs of 47 spectral lines in atomic manganese involving 26 even parity lower levels was recorded by laser induced fluorescence on an atomic beam most of the lower levels were positioned above 30 000cm 1.
@highlight For three even parity levels both hyperfinestructure constants A and B were determined for the first time for another eight levels new constants B were evaluated for several other levels the hfs constants were revised.
@highlight Semi empirical analysis of the even parity level system in Mn I was performed in a basis of 36 configurations.
@highlight Good consistency was found between the experimental hfs constants and those predicted in the semi empirical fit.
