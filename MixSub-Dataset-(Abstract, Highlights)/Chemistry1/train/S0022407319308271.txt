 The low lying electronic states of thallium fluoride are investigated using the multi reference configuration interaction method including the core valence and the spin orbit coupling effects . Based on the calculated potential energy curves the spectroscopic constants of the bound states of TlF are determined which are in accordance with available theoretical and experimental results in the literature . The transition dipole moments Franck Condon factors and the radiative lifetimes of the a
