 The role of individual functional groups has been assessed with regard to surface charge and chromatographic retention . Coatings were prepared from various fragments of the chiral zwitterionic materials Chiralpak ZWIX and ZWIX . The different chromatographic ligands allowed fine tuning of the surface charge . Chiralpak ZWIX phases showed strongly negative potentials over the entire pH range . Zwitterionic congeners with quinuclidine and sulfonic acid moieties but lacking the quinolone ring in the ligand structure exhibited shifted potentials of around 5 to 20 mV depending on the surrounding residues . Capillary electrophoretic mobilitiy measurements with the chromatographic ligands and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to offer some explanation of these surface charge differences of the distinct zwitterionic stationary phases . The new mixed mode phases were also chromatographically characterized by simple RP and HILIC tests . The results allowed their positioning within a large variety of different commercially available RP HILIC and mixed mode phases which were evaluated as well by multivariate data processing using principal component analysis . The new mixed mode phases overall exhibit reasonable hydrophilicity lipophilicity balance and enable retention of ionic compounds by additional ionic interactions through weak anion exchange strong cation exchange or both . Hence the new RP ZWIX phases can be flexible tools for selectivity tuning in RP and HILIC separations .
