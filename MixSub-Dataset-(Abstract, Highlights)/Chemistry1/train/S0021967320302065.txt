 This work focused on the development and validation of a method based on hollow fiber based solid phase microextraction coupled to ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of five antipsychotics at a pg mL

@highlight Polyether sulfone hollow fiber without any modification is selected as adsorbent for sample preparation.
@highlight Due to porosity of hollow fiber high adsorption capacity can be achieved.
@highlight This method exhibits excellent sensitivity pg mL
