 Single pieces of fossil wood fragments were collected from the middle Miocene First Lusatian lignite seam at the Adamw Jwin IIB and Tomisawice opencast mines and are characterized by maceral variety cellulose contents and their molecular and isotopic composition . Biomarker composition of xylites and

@highlight Xylites are affected by weak gelification and advanced cellulose decomposition.
