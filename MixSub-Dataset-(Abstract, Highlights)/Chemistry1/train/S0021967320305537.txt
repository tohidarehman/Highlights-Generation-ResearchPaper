 Efficient extraction of polar sulfonamides antibiotics from aqueous samples and food is very challenging because they are hydrophilic their concentration is very low and the matrix is complex . Covalent organic frameworks a novel porous organic material have attracted great attention . In this work the spherical triphenylbenzene dimethoxyterephthaldehyde COFs were synthesized by a simple room temperature method and due to their attractive properties such as high outstanding acid base stability large specific surface area low skeletal density inherent porosity and high crystallinity so TPB DMTP COFs as ideal solid phase extraction adsorbents showed excellent adsorption performance for trace polar sulfonamides in food and water . TPB DMTP COFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy powder X ray diffraction and so on . The important parameters were optimized to improve the extraction efficiency of TPB DMTP COFs toward sulfonamides . Analysis of sulfonamides was performed by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry . The developed method based on TPB DMTP COFs material achieved low limits of detection 0.51.0 ng L

@highlight Spherical TPB DMTP COFs was used as a SPE material for the first time.
@highlight The material achieved low LODs and good repeatability for sulfonamides.
@highlight It was used for the enrichment and analysis of sulfonamides in real samples.
