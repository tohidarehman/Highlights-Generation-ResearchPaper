 We report on a direct comparison of the separation performance in capillary nano LC between commercial packed bed columns and the small domain silica monoliths in applications . Octadecylsilylated monolithic silica capillary columns with a 50 and 100 m inner diameter were prepared with a procedure providing domain sizes in the sub 2 m range . The fabricated monolith columns could provide plate heights

@highlight Monolithic silica columns with sub 2 m domain size have been synthesized.
@highlight The produced monolith columns provide a high column efficiency 
@highlight  4 m .
@highlight Peak capacities 
@highlight  are 3040 higher than in a commercial particle column.
@highlight A high repeatability of the performance of the fabricated columns is demonstrated.
