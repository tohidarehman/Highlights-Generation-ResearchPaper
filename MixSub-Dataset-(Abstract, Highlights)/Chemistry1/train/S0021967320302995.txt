 A new derivatization reagent N 2 oxopropanehydrazonoyl chloride was prepared and coupled with four drugs bearing primary amino secondary amino or mercapto functional groups . Glucosamine sulfate cysteine captopril and vildagliptin were used as representative reactive analytes . The prepared reagent was successfully coupled with the targeted analytes in the presence of triethylamine as hydrochloride acceptor and acetonitrile as solvent . The resulting reaction products were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and monitored simultaneously by diode array and triple quad mass spectrometry detectors . Enhanced DAD and electrospray ionization MS responses were observed for the derivatized products . Complete derivatization of VIL was achieved after heating at 653C for 4min while other analytes were derivatized instantaneously at room temperature . Both the ESI ionization suppression due to the excess reagent and matrix effect due to co eluted biogenic plasma constituents were negligible . The derivatized GLU CYS CAP and VIL showed a maximum absorption wavelength at 376 417 340 and 376nm with MS limit of quantification value of 250.0 2.0 2.5 and 3.0pg L respectively . The relative ESI MS response of UOSA54 derivatization products was within the range of 0.64.1 compared with dansylated products . The method was optimized and validated for optimal reaction product stability sensitivity linearity range precision and accuracy . The percentage recovery was exceeding 97.2 with an RSD value of less than 4.0 . The limit of quantification of targeted analytes was ranged from 80.0 to 0.7pg L .
