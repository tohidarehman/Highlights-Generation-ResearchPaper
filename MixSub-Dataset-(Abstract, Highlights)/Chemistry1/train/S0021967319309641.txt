 A major strength of capillary electrophoresis is its ability to inject small sample volumes . However there is a great mismatch between injection volume and sample volumes . Electromigration based sample preparation methods are based on similar principles as CE . The combination of these methods with capillary electrophoresis could tackle obstacles in the analysis of dilute samples .

@highlight Three phase electroextraction was coupled directly to capillary electrophoresis.
@highlight A new method for sensitive analysis of biogenic amines was developed.
@highlight Application of the method to urine shows promise for use in metabolomics.
