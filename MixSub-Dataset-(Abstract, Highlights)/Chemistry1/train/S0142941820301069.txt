 A combination of solution casting and melt extrusion technique was used to fabricate Boron nitride filled Polylactic acid polybutylene adipate terephthalate blend composites . The BN particles were surface treated with a silane coupling agent and functionalization was confirmed via spectroscopic analysis . Field emission scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the BN surface treatment improved the particle adhesion with the polymer matrices and acted as a compatibilizer for the polymers . Moreover changes in the particle orientation in the blend composite yielded improved thermal conductivity in different directions . The inclusion of the treated BN particles enhanced the in plane 1.1Wm

@highlight PLA PBAT silane treated Boron nitride ternary composites were fabricated.
@highlight Thermal conductivity was measured using flash method.
@highlight High thermally conductivity blend composites were achieved with higher loading of treated BN.
@highlight The ternary composites exhibited superior thermomechanical properties than the PLA PBAT blend.
@highlight The ternary composite with higher BN loading exhibited superior mechanical properties.
