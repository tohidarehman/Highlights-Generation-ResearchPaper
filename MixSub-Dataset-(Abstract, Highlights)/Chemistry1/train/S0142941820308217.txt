 The use of bio based plasticizers with low toxicity and good compatibility with polyvinyl chloride has attracted more attention in the recent years . With bio based 2 5 furandicarboxylic acid and butyl oligo glycol ethers as raw materials three liquid furan based plasticizers of di furan 2 5 dicarboxylate di furan 2 5 dicarboxylate and di furan 2 5 dicarboxylate were synthesized by direct esterification . The chemical structure of three plasticizers was characterized with FTIR
