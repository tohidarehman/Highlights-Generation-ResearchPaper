 A high liquid transportation capability is required for high performance moisture functional wound dressing fabrics . However simultaneously accelerating liquid wetting and penetration aspects remains challenging . Herein we fabricated a fluffy polypropylenepolyethylene glycol fabric with branched micro and nanofiber via an environmentally friendly and cost effective melt blowing technique . The introduction of incompatible PEG reduced the viscosity of the PP melt and decreased the dimension of fibers thus a branched micro and nanofibrous structure was obtained . By incorporating the amount of 15wt PEG the water content of the outer face increased from 70.3 to 270.6 . A fluffy structure in the fabric s thickness direction was achieved by tailoring the die to collector distance during the melt blowing process . The porosity increased from 87.1 to 90.1 with the DCD increased from 10cm to 30cm which achieved a vertical penetration velocity of 7.02cm s at the water head of 90mm . Moreover micro and nanofibrous morphology with the excellent mechanical properties and fine hydrolytic stability could enhance the water retention capacity that maintain the humidity of a microenvironment . This branched fluffy fabric with fast water transportation capability is expected to be used in hygienic and medical fabric .

@highlight A fluffy polypropylene PP polyethylene glycol PEG micro nanofibrous fabrics with branched networks was prepared.
@highlight Introduction of PEG into the PP and increases of die to collector were conducive to fluffy branched network being enhanced.
@highlight Water content water permeability and water evaporation rate were used to record the liquid transport capacity.
@highlight The fluffy branched structure led to high performance moisture properties.
@highlight Further this fabric with the excellent mechanical properties exhibited effective water retention capacity that maintain the humidity of a microenvironment.
