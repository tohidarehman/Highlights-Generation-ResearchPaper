 In this paper an original experimental method is developed for local strain characterization at the surface of additively manufactured polymeric materials . The process used herein is material extrusion . This experimental method is based on the use of microscopic speckle pattern deposited at the surface of micro single edge notched specimen made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene . Two configurations of filament orientation were used for the specimen manufacturing . Images of the SENT specimen surface were recorded during in situ tensile test . The quantitative analysis of images was made by digital image correlation . The evolutions of the local strain heterogeneities and the crack tip are evidenced on the kinematic fields . It is shown that the crack propagates in the low resistance path which is the interface area between filaments . It is also evidenced that the intersection of perpendicular filaments in two adjacent layers blocks crack growth . The local strain evolutions at the surface of the specimen are compared to the macroscopic response of the material . The method developed herein allows the determination of the materials mechanical properties . The identification of the crack tip location using digital image correlation and J integral calculation lead to plot the J R curve . The J R curves comparison of the two specimen configurations shows that the fracture toughness is directly related to the material structure .
