 The migration of three additives from polypropylene samples into a series of five liquid food simulants was investigated at 60C in a repeated migration regime . This regime was simulated by 20 migration periods each of 8h and using initially additive free food simulants . Between these migration periods the bare samples were stored in an air conditioned room at around 23C for 16h at working days and for 64h during weekends . An asymptotic decrease of the additive level in the food simulants in the successive migration periods from a maximum values towards zero was observed when the additives easily solve in the food simulants . In contrast when the additives solve poorly in the food simulants this additive level decrease is almost linear and shows a slow decrease rate . In the first case the leaching migration of the additives is controlled mainly by their diffusion in the matrix of the polymer . In the latter case this process is controlled mainly by the partitioning of the additives between the polymer and food simulants . Two approaches were used to model theoretically these results .

@highlight Repeated migrations of three additives from polypropylene into five liquid food simulants were determined experimentally.
@highlight The repeated migrations were calculated using two different sets of diffusion and partition coefficients as input parameters.
@highlight A first set resulted from the actual recommendations of a practical guidance document to Regulation EU 10 2011.
@highlight The second set resulted from a best fit of the experimental results.
@highlight The differences between these calculated results are presented and discussed.
