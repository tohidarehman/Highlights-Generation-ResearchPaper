 Electrochemical experiments and first principle calculations were conducted in this study to investigate the impact of carbon doping on the adsorption and absorption on Fe C alloy surfaces . The generalized Iyer Pickering Zawenzaden model was adopted to determine the kinetics related to hydrogen adsorption absorption . Discharge rate constant k

@highlight Effect of carbon on hydrogen adsorption and absorption on Fe C alloys was studied.
@highlight Carbon doping surfaces are more unstable for hydrogen to adsorb on hydrogen surface coverage was reduced.
@highlight Carbon doping reduces the thermodynamic energy difference and diffusion barriers making hydrogen penetration into the bulk more facile.
