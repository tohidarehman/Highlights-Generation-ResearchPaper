 This study presents the development of an efficient extraction protocol for amoxicillin from plasma with improved solubility and stability using pH control . Solubility and stability of amoxicillin in commonly used extraction solvents were determined using a newly developed stability indicating high performance liquid chromatography method . Following this protein precipitation mediated sample purification protocol was developed and validated along with the HPLC method for the extracted amoxicillin from rabbit plasma . The protocol was applied in a pharmacokinetic study in rabbits . A five fold increase in solubility and two fold increase in stability of amoxicillin was found by addition of acetate buffer in acetonitrile . PP mediated extraction protocol containing acetate buffer acetonitrile resulted in an extraction recovery of 80 for all the samples . The HPLC assay following extraction was found linear
