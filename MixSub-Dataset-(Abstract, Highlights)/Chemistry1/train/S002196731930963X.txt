 The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass is a major challenge in the field of renewable energies and bio based chemicals . The diversity of biomasses and processes leads to complex products having a wide range of polarities and molecular weights . Nowadays the molecular description of these oxygenated matrices is still largely incomplete and new analytical strategies are required to have a better understanding of biomass products properties . The present study proposes a reliable protocol based on successive liquidliquid extractions prior to high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry HPLC MS
