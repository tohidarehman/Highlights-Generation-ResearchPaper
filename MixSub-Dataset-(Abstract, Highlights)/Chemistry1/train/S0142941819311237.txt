 Pea protein isolate and bean protein concentrate were evaluated as fiber forming vegetal source materials through electrospinning using various solvents . The effects of hexafluoroisopropanol trifluoroethanol trifluoroacetic acid formic acid and water on rheological and conformational properties of the protein solutions were determined . The morphology and molecular organization of the electrospun structures were studied . All PPI and BPC solutions displayed pseudoplastic behavior . Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that type turns and sheets were the dominant protein conformations in water HFIP and TFE . After electrospinning most of the solutions afforded beads . Fiber like morphologies were only obtained when BPC was dissolved in HFIP . BPC demonstrated better performance in the electrospinning process than PPI . Denaturation of the protein isolates was not sufficient to form fibers the viscosity of the solution as well as the vapor pressure of the solvents played an important role in defining the morphology .

@highlight Solutions of protein isolates in HFIP TFE TFA and FA showed a pseudoplastic behavior.
@highlight Beads were the most common morphology of the electrospun structures.
@highlight BPC demonstrated better performance in the electrospinning process than PPI.
@highlight BPC electrospun structures were obtained for the first time.
