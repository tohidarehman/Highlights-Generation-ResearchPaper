 Herein we present the results describing the synthesis and thermal mechanical and surface properties of liquid polybutadiene rubber cross linked with organosilicon reactants . The differences in the structure of cross linking agents as well as a number of reactive H Si species have a significant impact on the above mentioned properties of synthesized

@highlight A hybrid coatings were prepared
@highlight cross linking of liquid polybutadiene rubber with various organosilicon compounds
@highlight Thermal mechanical and surface properties of the obtained materials were examined.
@highlight The influence of chemical structure of cross linkers on the properties have been found and discussed.
@highlight The properties of polybutadiene based coatings can be modulated by selecting appropriate cross linker.
