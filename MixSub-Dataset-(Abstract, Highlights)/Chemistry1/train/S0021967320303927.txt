 The chiral separations of small peptides is an important challenge in the biological and medical sciences because different stereoisomers of chiral drugs can often possess different pharmacological pharmacokinetic and or toxicological activities . Commercially available crown ether chiral stationary phases based on

@highlight Enantioseparation of tetrapeptide Tyr Arg Phe Lys NH
@highlight on two crown ether chiral stationary phases is reported.
@highlight Baseline separation of all eight tetrapeptide enantiomer pairs was achieved.
@highlight Effect of the ACN content in the mobile phase on retention and enantioselectivity was studied.
@highlight Efforts to extend the use of chiral crown ether based CSPs in resolution of all sixteen tetrapeptide stereoisomers were made.
