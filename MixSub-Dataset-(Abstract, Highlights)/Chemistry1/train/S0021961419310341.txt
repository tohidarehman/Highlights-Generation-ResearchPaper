 We present viscosity measurements of three gas mixtures as well as of the pure fluids methane and ethane over the temperature range from

@highlight Viscosities of methane ethane mixtures were measured accurately.
@highlight A rotating body viscometer with magnetic suspension coupling was used.
@highlight Comparisons with literature data ab initio and model values are presented.
@highlight Good agreement with recent ab initio calculations and current reference values was found.
@highlight The experimental data were correlated with the modified Enskog theory.
