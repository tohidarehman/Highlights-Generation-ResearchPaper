 The use of high aspect ratio cylindrical pressure vessels and rotationally periodic burners in Pressurized Oxy Coal furnaces leads to physical behavior that is 3D periodic near the burner but which transitions to axisymmetric towards the outlet . A fully 3D model would consume unneeded resources and an axisymmetric model would fail to capture periodic features of the near burner region such as recirculation zones . The present work evaluates the ability of a dimensionally adaptive mesh to improve computational speed while still accurately calculating heat flux for such cylindrical systems . The Discrete Ordinates Method was used to solve the cylindrical Radiative Transfer Equation on both a dimensionally adaptive mesh and a fully 3D mesh . The effects of both spatial and angular refinement on speedup and agreement between the adaptive and fully 3D mesh were studied . For the four cylindrical combustor configurations studied speedups ranged from 46.6 on a coarse adaptive mesh to 49.1 on a fine mesh . Increasing angular resolution decreased speedups from 48.0 at S
