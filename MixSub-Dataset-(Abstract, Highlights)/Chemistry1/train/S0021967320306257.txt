 Phthalate diesters are a group of plasticizers extensively used in the manufacturing and processing of plastics . Phthalate monoesters are the primary degradation products of the diesters . Accumulation of endocrine disruptive diesters and monoesters in soil is of great concern because of the extensive use of plastic mulching and misdisposal of plastics . Accurate determination of their levels in soil is critical to assess the occurrence exposure and risks of phthalate diesters and monoesters . In this study we aimed to develop a robust and environmentally friendly method for the simultaneous determination of phthalate diesters and monoesters in soil . Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was used for quantification combined with accelerated solvent extraction and in line cleanup for sample preparation . The method detection limits for the 14 diesters and 11 monoesters were in the range of 0.59 to 10.08ng
