 The capability of liquid chromatography with microemulsions as mobile phases was studied for the analysis of four parabens and seven adrenoceptor antagonists . MEs were formed by mixing aqueous solutions of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate the alcohol 1 butanol that played the role of co surfactant and octane as oil . In order to guarantee the formation of stable MEs a preliminary study was carried out to determine the appropriate ranges of concentrations of the three components . For this purpose mixtures of variable composition were prepared and the possible separation of two phases was visually detected . The advantage offered by the addition of octane to micellar mobile phases inside the concentration range that allows the formation of stable MEs was evaluated by comparing the retention behaviour peak profile and resolution of mixtures of the probe compounds in the presence and absence of octane . The final aim of this work was the proposal of a mathematical equation to model the retention behaviour in microemulsion liquid chromatography . The derived global model that considered the three factors allowed the prediction of retention times at diverse mobile phase compositions with satisfactory accuracy . The behaviour was compared with that found with mobile phases without octane . The model also yielded information about the retention mechanism and revealed that octane when inserted inside the micelle modifies the interaction between solutes and micelles .

@highlight Microemulsion liquid chromatography was evaluated for parabens and adrenoceptor antagonists.
@highlight The performance was compared using sodium dodecyl sulfate and butanol with and without octane.
@highlight Octane showed the highest elution strength appreciably above SDS and 1 butanol.
@highlight The feasibility of modelling the retention with good accuracy is demonstrated.
@highlight The model indicates interactions between solutes and micelle are modified with added octane.
