 Traditional boron affinity materials usually capture cis diol containing molecules under alkaline condition but some cis diol containing molecules such as polyphenols are unstable and easy to be oxidized and degraded under alkaline condition . Teamed boronate affinity can specifically capture cis diol containing molecules under neutral condition . However the report about combination of TBA and magnetic nanoparticle for the extraction was rare . Here we fabricated two kinds of teamed boronate affinity magnetic nanoparticles including

@highlight Teamed boronate affinity TBA can specifically capture cis diol containing molecules under neutral condition.
@highlight TBA magnetic nanoparticles TBAMP was fabricated for capturing polyphenols under neutral condition.
@highlight TBAMP was used for magnetic solid phase extraction MSPE of 13 kinds of polyphenols.
@highlight MSPE combined with HPLC MS was used to detect polyphenols from Flos Lonicerae Beverage.
