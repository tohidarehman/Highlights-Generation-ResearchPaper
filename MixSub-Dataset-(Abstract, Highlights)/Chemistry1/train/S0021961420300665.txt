 Experimental analysis of vapour liquid phase equilibrium for five binary pairs of diethyl carbonate with methyl acetate ethyl acetate isopropyl acetate n butyl acetate and isoamyl acetate was carried out in this study . VLE data were generated experimentally at local atmospheric pressure of 95kPa in a glass dynamic recirculation still . Reliability of data was checked with the thermodynamic consistency tests by Van Ness infinite dilution pure component and mean absolute deviation test . Experimental data was found to be thermodynamically consistent with all tests and data was regressed with Wilson NRTL and UNIQUAC activity coefficient models to determine binary interaction parameters . Binary pair of DEC with n butyl acetate has shown azeotropic behaviour with minimum boiling azeotrope and a close boiling behaviour through out the composition range . No azeotropic behaviour was observed for the rest of the binary pairs .

@highlight Vapor liquid phase equilibrium behaviour is analyzed experimentally for five pairs of diethyl carbonate with esters.
@highlight Vapor liquid equilibrium VLE data is generated at local atmospheric pressure in the form of T x y plots.
@highlight Thermodynamic consistency of the data is checked to confirm suitability of the data for process modelling applications.
