 Electrospinning has been extensively accepted as one of most important techniques for fabrication of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering . Polycaprolactone is one of the most applied electro spinned scaffolds . Since low mechanical strength of polycaprolactone scaffold leads to the limitation of its applications composition of polycaprolactone with ceramic particles is of great interest . Several studies have been conducted on fabrication and characterization of polycaprolactone nanocomposite scaffolds but none of these researches has used mesoporous silica particles . In this project a high strength and bioactive nanocomposite scaffold has been developed which consists of polycaprolactone and mesoporous silica particles . Results showed that increase of KIT 6 particles percentages up to 5 leads to the enhancement of tensile strength of scaffold from 1.80.2 to 2.91.0MPa . Although wettability of scaffolds in presence of particles was totally lower than pure PCL scaffold but increase of particles percentages led to enhancement of wettability and water absorption of scaffolds . On the other hand presence of KIT 6 particles increased specific surface area and also bioactivity of scaffold was increased by enhancement of ion exchange between surface and simulated body fluid . Finally it was concluded that PCL KIT 6 scaffolds are a suitable candidate for application in tissue engineering .
