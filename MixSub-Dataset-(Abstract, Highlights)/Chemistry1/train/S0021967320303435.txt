 Fixed bed adsorption is widely used for separations and purifications of active components in medicine and for wastewater treatment . At present fixed bed adsorption breakthrough curve is generally obtained by manual sampling and off line detection . In this study we proposed a method for on line monitoring of fixed bed adsorption process using a self assembled fiber optic sensing system . The adsorption of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid on the fixed bed packed with molecularly imprinted polymers and non imprinted polymers were studied . The reproducibility and precision of the system was investigated . The relative standard deviation of the system was less than 1.54 which indicates that the system has a good reproducibility . The effects of initial concentration flow rate adsorbent mass and particle size on the breakthrough curves were investigated . Through screening it was found that adsorption kinetics of the polymer materials fit to Thomas and Yoon Nelson models . The MIPs showed high binding capacity good selectivity fast adsorption rate indicating a great potential for the treatment of 2 4 D contaminated water . Moreover this study has identified that the detection method has the advantages of being on line realtime simple and accurate . The on line method can facilitate the study of fixed bed adsorption processes and accelerate the understanding of adsorption kinetics .
