 This work was to investigate piperonylonitrile in terms of its solidliquid equilibrium solubility in thirteen pure solvents by employing laser monitoring technique . Solubility measurements were completed in range of temperature at K in 1 4 dioxane and at K in isopropanol 2 methoxyethanol ethanol ethyl acetate methanol

@highlight Solubility of piperonylonitrile in thirteen pure solvents was measured.
