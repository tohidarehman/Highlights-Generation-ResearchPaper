 Heat resistance epoxy shape memory materials were prepared based on diglycidylether of bisphenol A epoxy resin with the mixture of 4 4 diaminodiphenylether and phthalide containing aromatic amine which was synthesized by Michael addition of 3 3 bisphenyl phthalide and DDM in different molar ratios as curing agents . The chemical structure of PBMI DDM was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra . The dynamical mechanical behavior and high temperature tensile properties and the influence of PBMI DDM content and number of cycles on SM performance were investigated in detail . With increasing PBMI DDM content the glass transition temperatures

@highlight Synthesis of a novel phthalide containing aromatic amine and epoxy SMPs.
@highlight Their crosslinked density reduces with the content of phthalide groups.
@highlight Their optimal deformability can be achieved by adjusting phthalide content.
@highlight Their tensile ultimate elongation at deformation temperature is better.
@highlight Their shape memory performance is improved with increasing phthalide groups.
