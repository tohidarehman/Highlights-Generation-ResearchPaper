 In recent years significant advancements in Fused Filament Fabrication have enabled this technology to become one of the most leading techniques of Additive Manufacturing for the production of functional products . The poor mechanical properties of manufactured parts have traditionally imposed considerable limitations on use of FFF processes . These shortcomings have been overcome using new advanced filaments with nanoparticle reinforced components short length and continuous fibres and other composite material processing technologies . Polymers reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets have been an effective solution for improving electrical thermal and mechanical properties . However the geometric properties of functional products manufactured with GNP reinforced polymers have not been analysed in spite of being crucial for the manufacture assembly and service life of functional products . The aim of this study was to compare an improved PLA polymer with a GNP reinforced PLA composite by analysing the geometric properties of dimensional accuracy flatness error surface texture and surface roughness .

@highlight Geometric properties of unreinforced PLA and PLA Graphene composite materials were analysed.
@highlight The impact of 3D printing parameters on geometric behaviour was evaluated.
@highlight Dimensional accuracy was affected by build orientation and extruder displacement.
@highlight Flatness error and surface roughness were strongly conditioned by building orientation.
@highlight In general both materials showed no significant variations in geometric properties.
