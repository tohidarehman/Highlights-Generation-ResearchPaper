 Peptide N glycosidase F is the most frequently used enzyme to release N glycan from glycoproteins in glycomics however the releasing process using PNGase F is tedious and can range in duration from hours to overnight . Recently efforts have been made to accelerate this enzymatic reaction and they include the use of microwave irradiation ultrahigh pressure enzyme immobilization and other techniques . Here we developed a novel method combining the oriented immobilization of PNGase F on magnetic particles and microwave assisted enzymatic digestion techniques to achieve highly efficient release of N glycans . The oriented immobilization of PNGase F on magnetic particles utilizes the affinity of its co expressed His tag towards iminodiacetic acid Nickel modified magnetic particles . Compared with non oriented immobilization the oriented immobilization of PNGase F exhibits several advantages including tolerance to high temperature and the ability to retain strong activity after more than five reuses . When used in combination with microwave irradiation efficient N glycan removal from ribonuclease B was achieved within 5min . The proposed strategy was also used to release glycan from fetuin and human serum and has proven to provide a promising deglycosylation method for the characterization of protein glycosylation .
