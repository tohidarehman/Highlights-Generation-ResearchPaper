 Chiral column chromatography is a revolutionary analytical methodology for the enantioseparation of novel positron emission tomography tracers in the primary stages of drug development . Due to the different behaviors of tracer enantiomers in administrated subjects their separation and purification is a challenging endeavor . Over the last three decades different commercial chiral columns have been applied for the enantioseparation of PET radioligand or radiotracers using high performance liquid chromatography . The categorization and reviewing of them is a vital topic . This review presents a brief overview of advances applications and future prospectives of CCC in radiopharmaceutical approaches . In addition the effective chromatographic parameters and degravitation trends to enhance enantioseparation resolution are addressed . Moreover the application and potential of chiral super fluidical chromatography as an alternative for enantioseparation in the field of radiopharmaceutical is discussed . Finally the crucial application challenges of CCC are explained and imminent tasks are suggested .
