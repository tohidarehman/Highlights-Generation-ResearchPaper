 This study focused on montmorillonite modification and crystal structure regulation to prepare polypropylene montmorillonite composites with high stiffness and toughness simultaneously . A kind of organic montmorillonite was prepared successfully through a new and simple method which was introducing Fe

@highlight The modified montmorillonites form an intercalation structure in polypropylene matrix.
@highlight The synergistic effect of Montmorillonite and TMB 5 on PP crystallization is researched.
@highlight A good balance between toughness and stiffness of composites is realized.
@highlight Various characterization methods were adopted to analyse nanocomposite system.
