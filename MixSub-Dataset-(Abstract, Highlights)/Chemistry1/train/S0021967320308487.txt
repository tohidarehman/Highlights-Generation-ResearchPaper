 High molecular weight aggregate formation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies during cation exchange chromatography has been frequently observed and can be a challenge for downstream purification . To gain mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon aggregate formation in bind elute CEX for two therapeutic mAbs was examined on three CEX resins . First mAb structural stability was studied in solutions under CEX load conditions . Using differential scanning fluorimetry the measured melting temperature Tm

@highlight mAb structural stability decreases when lowering the solution pH from 6.0 to 4.5
@highlight mAb structural stability further decreases when bound on CEX surfaces
@highlight mAb accessible hydrophobicity of CEX resins affects structural stability of bound mAb
@highlight A fluorescence based method is used to quantitatively characterize CEX resin hydrophobicity
@highlight Overall mAb resin interactions and inherent resin hydrophobicity dictate mAb aggregation in CEX step
