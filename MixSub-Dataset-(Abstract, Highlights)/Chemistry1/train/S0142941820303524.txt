 The effect of exfoliated graphite on the mechanical tribological and dielectric properties of the silicone rubber composites has been systematically investigated and analysed . Morphological analysis of the composites helps to understand the interfacial interaction between the filler and the rubber matrix as well as wear mechanism respectively . An enhancement in the mechanical tribological and dielectric properties was observed with an increase in filler loading and better performance was observed at 7 phr of filler loading . The improvement in performance is attributed to the better interaction between the QM chains and the EG layers as evident from the AFM and TEM analysis . It is also evident from the Kraus plot which supports the reinforcing effect of EG in QM matrix .
