 Retention rules are well known in liquid chromatography . For the mobile phase composition retention decreases when adding organic solvent to water for reversed phase or increasing water proportion for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and a decrease in temperature usually increases retention . For supercritical fluids the fluid density which is related to temperature and column back pressure is significant for neat CO
