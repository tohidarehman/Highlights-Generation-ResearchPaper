 The saturated solubility of 6 phenyl 3 pyridazinone in aqueous co solvent mixtures of methanol ethanol isopropanol and ethylene glycol was determined through experiment by employing the saturation shake flask method at temperatures from 278.15 to 318.15K and local atmospheric pressure . For all the co solvent mixtures the maximum value of solubility was observed in neat methanol . The 6 phenyl 3 pyridazinone solubility in mole fraction scale was well correlated by using the Jouyban Acree model and vant Hoff Jouyban Acree model obtaining the values of relative average deviations smaller than 3.98 and root mean square deviation lower than 7.8110
