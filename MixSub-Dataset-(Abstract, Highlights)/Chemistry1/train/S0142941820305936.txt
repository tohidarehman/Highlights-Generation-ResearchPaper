 Applications of a hybrid material consisting of polyacrylamide and Xylidyl Blue for the removal of uranyl ions from aqueous solutions has been investigated with all details . Adsorption experiments were performed at batch mode and constant temperature . Experimental parameters affecting adsorption process such as pH initial uranyl concentration time and temperature were studied on the removal of the uranyl ions . The isotherms assays were carried out with synthetic solutions and adsorption data were evaluated by using Langmuir Freundlich and DubininRadushkevich isotherm models . Morphological and chemical characterizations of new synthesized material were investigated by UV VIS NIR spectroscopy and SEM EDX techniques and pH

@highlight A new polymeric adsorbent containing a powerful chelating for uranyl ions was developed and characterized.
@highlight Characterization was carried out by FTIR EDX SEM UV VIS and PZC technical.
@highlight As we know this is the first application for grafting of Xylidyl Blue to a polymeric matrix.
@highlight can be used as potential adsorbent for removal or pre concentration of uranyl.
