 Use of surfactants in numerous household and industrial processes and their interaction with proteins in our day to day life has made protein surfactant interactions a booming topic among the researchers of current era . Bovine serum albumin being structural homologue to Human Serum albumin allowed us to study its binding efficiency with anionic surfactant such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate . BSA is known as transport protein due its binding characteristics as well as transportation of hydrophobic drugs or ligands to different target areas . Surfactants are also known as eminent constituents of pharmaceutical drug delivery systems . So interactions of BSA SDBS in presence of two industrially important co solvents DMSO and Glycerol have decided its fate as a novel drug delivery system . These interactional studies were performed by means of myriad experimental and theoretical approaches i.e . conductivity fluorescence Ligand Simultaneous Docking and non covalent interactions index . Results showed the dominance of Van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic forces with important changes in the preferred binding site .

@highlight Structural changes of Bovine Serum Albumin BSA on addition of an anionic surfactants were studied.
@highlight A combined scheme experimental and multiple ligand molecular modeling study was performed.
@highlight Micellization and quenching process were evaluated.
