 In source fragmentation of ginsenosides in the positive ESI mode frequently occurs which results in little fragment information useful for the structural elucidation . We are aimed to unveil the genesic mechanism and explore its potential significance in quality control of Ginseng and the related compound formulae . By applying six high resolution mass spectrometers from Agilent Waters and Thermo Fisher we could primarily demonstrate the susceptibility of pISF G. The ion clusters in the positive full scan MS

@highlight ISF of ginsenosides in positive ESI mode was studied systematically.
@highlight ISF of ginsenosides was examined on six different HRMS instruments.
@highlight SIM of the sapogenin product ions delineated group target ginsenoside profiles.
@highlight A novel characteristic chromatogram CC was elaborated for Ginseng.
@highlight IM SIM CC could identify seven Ginseng and their presence in TCM formulae.
