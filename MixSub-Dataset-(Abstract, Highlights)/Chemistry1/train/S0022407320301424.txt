 An optical frequency comb referenced quantum cascade laser is used to perform wavelength modulation Lamb dip spectroscopy on a large number of ro vibrational transitions falling in the CHF

@highlight The absolute line center frequencies of 59 lines were measured with a fractional uncertainty ranging from 910
@highlight to 2 10
@highlight which represents a two order of magnitude improvement with respect to our previous studies A .
@highlight In addition a detailed comparison with recent high resolution FTIR measurements B was also accomplished bringing out an enhancement in the accuracy performance by more than three orders of magnitude.
