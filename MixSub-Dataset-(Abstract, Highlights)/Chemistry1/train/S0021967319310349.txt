 This work presents the investigation of utilizing adenine functionalized polypropylene glycol for capillary gas chromatographic separations . The statically coated APPG column showed moderate polarity and high column efficiencies of 4660plates m and 4376plates m determined by

@highlight Adenine functionalized polypropylene glycol.
@highlight High resolution of the Grob test mixture and the isomers of anilines and phenols.
@highlight Simultaneously improved column selectivity and inertness.
@highlight Advantageous performance over conventional stationary phases.
