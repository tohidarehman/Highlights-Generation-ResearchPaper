 A compound specific chlorine bromine isotope analysis method was developed using gas chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry for polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers which are toxic to human health and are frequently detected in various abiotic and biotic media . For PCB congeners the molecular ion method for a concentration of 0.510.0 ppm a dwell time of 20100 ms a relative EM voltage of 200 V an electric current of 34 A and an ionization energy of 70 eV was determined as the most suitable scheme which obtained standard deviations of chlorine isotope ratios ranging from 0.00008 to 0.00068 . As for the PBDE congeners the lowest SDs ranging from 0.00050 to 0.00172 were determined using the top four ion method with a concentration of 510 ppm and a dwell time of 2050 ms . Both the chlorine and bromine isotope ratios showed strong concentration dependencies . Therefore external standardization or detecting chlorine and bromine isotope ratios at a uniform concentration level is necessary to eliminate the concentration effect . In addition

@highlight A Cl Br CSIA method using GC qMS was developed for PCBs and PBDEs.
@highlight The best schemes were the molecular ion PCB and top four ion PBDE methods.
@highlight Both chlorine and bromine isotope ratios showed strong concentration dependencies.
@highlight Cl Br CSIA provides a new way to trace the sources and degradation of PCBs PBDEs.
