 In this study 31 racemates of N FMOC amino acids with different chemico physical characteristics have been successfully resolved in fast enantioselective chromatography on recently developed zwitterionic teicoplanin chiral stationary phases . The CSPs were prepared by covalently bonding the teicoplanin selector on fully porous particles of narrow dispersion particle size distribution and superficially porous particles . Both the zwitterionic teicoplanin CSPs have proved to be ideal media for the separation of this important class of compounds . In particular the zwitterionic CSP prepared on superficially porous particles exhibited superior enantioselectivity and resolution compared to that made of fully porous particles in virtue of more favorable thermodynamics . The zwitterionic nature of these CSPs allowed avoiding the annoying effect of Donnan s exclusion of enantiomers from the stationary phase . This effect on the opposite was frequently observed on a commercial teicoplanin CSP employed for comparative purposes . Noticeably on the zwitterionic teicoplanin CSPs by using either acetonitrile or methanol rich mobile phases it was possible to favor speed over enantioresolution and vice versa . This work gives further replies to the request for rapid determination of enantiomeric excess of N FMOC proteinogenic AAs typically used as preferred chiral synthons in the solid phase synthesis of therapeutic peptides .
