 As an endogenous nucleoside adenosine was significant for the diagnosis and treatment of some diseases such as schizophrenia . However due to the complicated matrix interference it was difficult to monitor trace or ultra trace adenosine directly in bio samples . In this contribution a novel in tube SPME technique based on aptamer Au nanoparticles coated open tubular fused silica capillary was established to separate and enrich adenosine in bio samples with high affinity . Therefore a uniform and dense AuNPs layer was coated on the inner surface of the open tubular capillary and then adenosine aptamer was immobilized on AuNPs with a high capacity of 2.44g per 27 cm capillary . As a result the capillary shown high selectivity to adenosine with a selectivity factor of 14.4 when compared with the scrambled aptamer AuNPs coated capillary . Also the extraction amount of adenosine was 2.824.8 times higher than those of its structural analogs and contrast such as guanosine uridine cytidine thymidine and toluic acid . After the optimization of extraction conditions the aptamer AuNPs coated in tube SPME HPLC method was developed for the adenosine assay with the linear range of 0.0020.100gmL
