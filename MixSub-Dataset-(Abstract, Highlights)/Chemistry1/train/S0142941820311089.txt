 Laminated polymer steel composites are promising layered materials for practical applications in the automotive industry considering their superior crush resistance capacity in terms of enhanced damping potential . In this research the sheet lamination route of friction stir additive manufacturing technology was implemented for the production of a poly methyl methacrylate polymer matrix composite structure as reinforced by textile stainless steel layers and feeding of PMMA granulates inside the stirred region . Layers bonding and the soundness of composite formation during fabrication of the laminated structure were studied . Possible chemical interactions between the steel and PMMA during friction stir mixing followed by solid state consolidation of composite layers were characterized by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis . The results revealed some evidence for dipole bonding between iron with oxygen and carbon elements . Orientation dependency of polymer steel sheet laminated composite structures was demonstrated by universal tensile testing and flexural bending from different sections and fractographic analyses . Superior flexural bending was shown for the produced layered structure .
