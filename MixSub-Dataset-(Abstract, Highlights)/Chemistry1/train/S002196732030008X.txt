@highlight Model based approach for scaling up chromatographic capture step was developed.
@highlight Model system for the study was fibroblast growth factor protein from an
@highlight homogenate.
@highlight Dynamic model was formulated which was used to scale up the operation.
@highlight Effects of feed viscosity and competitive adsorption of impurities were accounted for.
