 In this study we describe the experimental variables influencing enantioseparation of twelve blockers when analyzed under polar organic reversed phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography conditions on a column with immobilized amylose

@highlight Chiral separations on amylose
@highlight  3 chloro 5 methylphenylcarbamate column.
@highlight Evaluation of variables influencing enantioseparation of blockers by HPLC.
@highlight Effect of mobile phase composition and temperature in HPLC polar organic conditions.
@highlight Study of solvent and buffer type pH and composition of mobile phases in RP HPLC.
@highlight Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography mode is explored and discussed.
