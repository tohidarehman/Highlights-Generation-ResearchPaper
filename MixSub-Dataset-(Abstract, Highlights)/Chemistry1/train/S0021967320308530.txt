 Environmental sciences are expanding and are based on standardized and certified calibrations when measurements are required . When a gaseous composition is quantified commercial standards are used . Here we report on a two component device for the preparation and injection of gas mixtures at the appropriate levels of pressure and volume . The two component calibrator injector can be used simultaneously or separately depending on the experimental objective but their combination is extremely effective for injecting gas mixtures at low concentrations . The quantity of gas introduced into a gas chromatograph with the injector can be adapted to the sensitivity of the detector or to avoid column overload . The calibrator provides for a large range of gas mixture concentrations from ppm to mol mol with an error of preparation of around 1 and an accuracy of less than 3 . This device prepares a variety of gas mixtures which are compared with certified mixtures by means of gas chromatographic measurements . The results show good agreement between prepared and certified mixtures with a maximum difference of 2 which remains within the relative error of commercial standard . In addition the preparation of dissolved methane at different concentrations in seawater is presented as a direct application of the calibrator .
