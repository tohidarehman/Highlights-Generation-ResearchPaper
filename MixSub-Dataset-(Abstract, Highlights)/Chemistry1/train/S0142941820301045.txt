 Use of nanocomposites is a well established approach in enhancing the mechanical and barrier properties of bionanocomposite film for food packaging applications . The seed mucilage of

@highlight mucilage based nanocomposite films were prepared.
@highlight The physical and mechanical properties of the films were altered by pH of mucilage solution.
@highlight XRD showed exfoliated dispersion of MMT at pH 9 and 5 MMT.
@highlight The film showed improved tensile strength and reduced water vapour permeability.
@highlight The improved nanocomposite film is suitable for food packaging applications.
