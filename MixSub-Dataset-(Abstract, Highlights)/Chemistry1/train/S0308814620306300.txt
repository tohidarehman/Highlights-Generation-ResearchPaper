 A colorimetric pH indicator was developed using nanofibers of poly and polyethylene oxide combined with biomass of the microalga

@highlight The microalga
@highlight biomass changes its color at different pH values.
@highlight Polymeric nanofibers containing the microalgal biomass present a hydrophilic surface.
@highlight Nanofibers containing the microalgal biomass are useful as a pH indicator for food.
@highlight The pH indicator does not lose its colorimetric potential over time.
