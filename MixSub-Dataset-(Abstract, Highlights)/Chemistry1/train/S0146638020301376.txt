 Hydrothermal systems have a pronounced effect on deep sea chemistry and some plumes are reported to occupy large parts of ocean volume . However the impact of these systems on the marine organic carbon cycle is not well understood . Here we compare the distribution of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers in several short and one long sediment core of hydrothermal vent sites at the Central and Southeast Indian Ridges and to those of nearby normal marine sediment as reference to characterize the impact of hydrothermal activity on deep sea sediment organic matter . We detected a range of GDGTs in some of the sediments . BrGDGT and GMGTs were absent at the normal marine reference location but present in some of the hydrothermal sediments with relatively high concentrations of brGMGT IIIa and brGDGT Ia hinting at

@highlight Distributions of GDGTs in sediment cores of hydrothermal vent sites of Central and Southeast Indian Ridges were studied.
@highlight brGDGTs occurring in hydrothermal sediments are absent in open marine reference sediments.
@highlight brGMGTs were detected only at hydrothermal influenced sediments.
@highlight A minor trend of increasing
@highlight values with depth at the hydrothermal influenced sites was observed.
@highlight The influence of hydrothermal vent activity appears to be minor in surrounding sediments.
