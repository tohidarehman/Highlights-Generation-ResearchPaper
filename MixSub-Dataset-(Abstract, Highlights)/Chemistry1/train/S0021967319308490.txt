 The present study reports on the analysis of different factors affecting the magnitude of the peak capacity for intact protein separations conducted in gradient reversed phase liquid chromatography . Experiments were conducted using a 200m i.d . capillary styrene

@highlight The maximum peak capacity is achieved at a flow rate 20 x higher than the optimal van Deemter flow rate.
@highlight The gradient volume has an important impact on overall peak capacity.
@highlight The use of TFA as ion pairing agent leads to better mass loadability compared to FA.
