 Hydrogen segregation to vacancies in the surface and subsurface layers of and surfaces of Pd is studied in the density functional theory approach . Adsorption energies and configurations of various clusters of H atoms at the vacancies are calculated . The adsorption energy varies for different sites in the vacancies with the distance to the surface from 0.26eV to 0.62eV . Enhanced binding is found for the sites above the pores produced by vacancies in the subsurface layer . For the surface vacancy the most favorable for segregation are tetrahedral lattice sites while for octa sites have higher binding energy . Lattice relaxation effects are minor for the surface but noticeably enhanced for the surface . Hydrogen segregation to surface layer vacancies is accompanied with minimal charge transfer which shows itself in cluster configurations . At high surface coverage the reduction of the cluster formation energy due to the H segregation should result in strongly enlarged concentration of the subsurface vacancy clusters while the surface remains undamaged due to the prevailing surface adsorption .
