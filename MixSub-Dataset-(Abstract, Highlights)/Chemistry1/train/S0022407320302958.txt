 The composition of the Earth s atmosphere is changing . The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment satellite measures infrared transmission spectra of the atmosphere using the Sun as a light source . ACE provides a global view of atmospheric composition from altitude composition profiles for 44 molecules starting in February 2004 . Altitude latitude abundance distributions and composition trends for more than 16 years are presented and briefly discussed . The ACE trends provide a quantitative state of the atmosphere report .
