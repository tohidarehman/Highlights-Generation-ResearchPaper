 Natural products and traditional medicines are used for treatment of various diseases and also to develop new drugs . However identification of drug leads within the immense biodiversity of living organisms is a challenging task that requires considerable time labor and computational resources as well as the application of modern analytical instruments . LCMS platforms are widely used for both drug discovery and quality control of TMs and food supplements . Moreover a large dataset generated during LCMS analysis contains valuable information that could be extracted and handled by means of various data mining and statistical tools . Novel sophisticated LCMS based approaches are being introduced every year . Therefore this review is prepared for the scientists specialized in pharmacognosy and analytical chemistry of NPs as well as working in related areas in order to navigate them in the world of diverse LCMS based techniques and strategies currently employed for NP discovery and dereplication quality control pattern recognition and sample comparison and also in targeted and untargeted metabolomic studies . The suggested classification system includes the following LCMS based procedures elemental composition determination isotopic fine structure analysis mass defect filtering

@highlight Analytical strategies employed in the natural products research are discussed.
@highlight Dereplication and untargeted metabolomics workflows are decomposed to separate blocks.
@highlight A von Koch star based classification of LCMS techniques is suggested.
@highlight Recent advances of the analytical techniques for traditional medicine study are included.
