 Equilibrium swelling measurement was employed to correlate the Hildebrand solubility parameter of styrene butadiene rubber with using different kinds of solvents . The was estimated to be a range from 17 MPa

@highlight The swelling responses of Styrene butadiene rubber have been measured in different types of solvents.
@highlight The three dimensional solubility parameters of the SBR have been determined.
@highlight New Flory Huggins interaction parameter 
@highlight  has been calculated with HSP values.
@highlight The relationship of correlation index and
@highlight value has been established.
@highlight The interactions between SBR and ingredients can be calculated now for better formula design.
