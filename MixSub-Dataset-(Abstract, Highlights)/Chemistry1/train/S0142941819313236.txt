 The frictional behaviors of prepreg prepreg and prepreg tool play the most important role in hot diaphragm forming and greatly influence the quality of the final product . A new set up was developed to characterize the frictional behaviors for unidirectional carbon fiber epoxy prepreg . The effects of temperature normal force pulling rate and relative fiber angles on the frictional behaviors of the prepreg prepreg and prepreg tool interface have been investigated . Results of these tests are presented and observations are noted . The results show that the frictional resistance increases with increase in the normal force and the pulling rate and its variation with the temperature is complicated . The frictional resistance is higher at 90 fiber orientation to the pulling direction than that at 45 and 0 .

@highlight A new apparatus was developed to characterize the friction for unidirectional carbon fiber epoxy prepreg during hot diaphragm forming process.
@highlight Inter ply friction in between prepreg and prepreg tool frictional behavior were systematically investigated.
@highlight The effect of temperature normal force and pulling rate on the frictional behavior of the prepreg prepreg and prepreg tool were studied.
@highlight Measurements were performed with different relative fiber angles at the slipping interface.
@highlight These results provide a large amount of data for subsequent simulation of diaphragm forming.
