 This work focuses on the determination of important thermochemical properties of several chemical warfare agent simulants diethyl methylphosphonate DEMP CAS 683 08 9

@highlight New experimental vapor pressure results on chemical warfare agent CWA simulants.
@highlight Work contains experimental results for DEMP TEP malathion and MS.
@highlight Vapor pressures measured with the transpiration method at ambient conditions.
@highlight Additional physico chemical properties e.g. enthalpies of sublimation were derived.
