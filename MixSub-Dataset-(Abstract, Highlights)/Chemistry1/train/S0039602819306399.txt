 The structure of high Miller index Si surface inclined at 10.7 to the plane is investigated using low energy electron diffraction scanning tunneling microscopy and first principles calculations based on the density functional theory . It was shown that the surface has the 11 periodicity and is significantly reconstructed exhibiting the pentameric structures similar to that found on Si and Ge surfaces . The tentative surface model is developed on the basis of high resolution STM images and the universal building block structure recently proposed for Si and Ge reconstructed surfaces 46 .

@highlight The structure of Si 47 35 7 surface is investigated using LEED STM and DFT.
@highlight The surface is significantly reconstructed exhibiting the pentameric structures.
@highlight The surface model is proposed based on the universal building block structure.
