 For the first time herein we report the theoretical investigation on short and elongated photonic nanojets generated by single solid hollow core shell microparticles illuminated with focused Gaussian beams . This investigation is carried out using developed analytical equations based on Bromwich formalism . The effect of the beam waist thickness of shell size and refractive index of the microparticle on the characteristic parameters of the PNJs such as maximum electric field enhancement spatial separation between the PNJs and length of the PNJs is studied in detail . The electric field enhancement values of the PNJs upon FGB illumination are compared to those obtained from the plane wave illumination .

@highlight Using developed analytical equations for the first time the theoretical investigation has been done on short and elongated photonic nanojets PNJs generated by single solid hollow core shell microparticles illuminated with focused Gaussian beams FGBs .
@highlight The effect of the beam waist thickness of shell size and refractive index of the microparticle on the characteristic parameters of the PNJs has been studied systematically.
@highlight The electric field enhancement values of the PNJs upon FGB illumination are compared to those obtained from the plane wave illumination.
@highlight We strongly believe that the analytical equations reported in this manuscript will be useful to the Nanophotonics community to understand the characteristic parameters of the PNJs generated by various types of solid hollow core shell microparticles of any arbitrary size illuminated by FGBs with different beam waists.
