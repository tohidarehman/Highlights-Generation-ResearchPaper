 The equilibrium 5 nitrosalicylaldehyde solubility in methanol water ethanol water isopropanol water and acetonitrile water mixtures was determined by a shake flask method from 273.15K to 313.15K under local pressure of 101.2kPa . At the same mass fraction of methanol and temperature the mole fraction solubility of 5 nitrosalicylaldehyde was greater in mixture than in ethanol water isopropanol water and methanol water mixtures . The relative importance of solutesolvent and solventsolvent interactions upon the solubility variation was valued by using the linear solvation energy relationship analysis of solvent effect . The method of inverse KirkwoodBuff integrals was used to study the preferential solvation on the basis of thermodynamic solution properties . The preferential solvation parameters for methanol ethanol isopropanol and acetonitrile were positive in the four mixtures in co solvent rich and intermediate composition indicating that 5 nitrosalicylaldehyde was solvated preferentially by the co solvent . It is conjecturable that in these regions 5 nitrosalicylaldehyde acts as a Lewis acid with the alcohols molecules while for the acetonitrile water mixture the preferential solvation could be attributed to polarization effects . Moreover the drugs solubility was mathematically represented via the Jouyban Acree model acquiring the average relative deviations 6.03 .
