 This study describes the synthesis of a novel polymer coated magnetic porous carbon composite derived from magnetic metal organic framework and its utilization in multi target environmental pollutants preconcentration . In this regards Fe

@highlight A novel polymer coated magnetic porous carbon MPC nanocomposite is synthesized.
@highlight The MPC was derived from a magnetic metal organic framework.
@highlight This sorbent was used in multi target environmental pollutants preconcentration.
@highlight The whole extraction time was 8.0 min.
@highlight This method is simple accurate and precise for the analysis of complex matrixes.
