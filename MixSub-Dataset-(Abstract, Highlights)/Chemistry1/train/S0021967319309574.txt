 Modified micellar liquid chromatography with a natural deep eutectic solvent produced from choline chloride and ethylene glycol was employed for melamine monitoring in milk matrix . This sustainable mobile phase was attained through chemometrical optimization of crucial variables including concentration of sodium dodecyl sulphate along with volume percentages of both NADES and glacial acetic acid . The desirability function and central composite design were utilized as chemometrical tools . Retention time t
