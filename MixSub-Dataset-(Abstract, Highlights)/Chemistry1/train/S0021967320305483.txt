 In sample pre treatment millifluidic electromembrane platforms have been developed to extract and pre concentrate target molecules with good clean up that minimize matrix effects . Optimal operation conditions are normally determined experimentally repeating the extractions at different conditions and determining the efficiencies by an analytical technique . To shorten and simplify the optimization protocol millifluidic platforms have been electrically characterized by impedance spectroscopy . The magnitude of the resistance of the electromembrane has been found very predictive of the migration capacity and extraction efficiency of three different parabens on real time . The optimal conditions have been successfully applied in the extraction of parabens from urine samples that not only improves the extraction efficiency but also provides a very low current intensity which is very important in electromembrane to minimize electrolysis phenomena . The possibility to optimize one of the most critical and important parameters such as the voltage with a simple electrical model may accelerate the production of application specific millifluidic electromembrane platforms in a short development time . The results showed that millifluidic electromembrane extraction based low voltage has a future potential as a simple selective and time efficient sample preparation technique allowing a simple battery as power supply .
