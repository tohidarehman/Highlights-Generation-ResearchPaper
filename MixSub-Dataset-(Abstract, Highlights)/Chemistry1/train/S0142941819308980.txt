 Shrimp shell wastes protein mixed with chitosan were used as the sources of biopolymers to prepare active films and different concentrations of oolong tea extract corn silk extract and black soybean seed coat extract were added as active constituents . The physicochemical properties of films as observed by scanning electron microscopic differential scanning calorimeter fourier transform infrared and X ray diffraction were strongly affected by the addition of OTE CSE and BSSCE . The thermal stability was improved with increased concentration of the extracts . The films incorporated with 5 w w BSSCE improved the barrier of film against the UV light with the transparency value of 15.97mm

@highlight Functional shrimp shell wastes protein SSWP based films were prepared.
@highlight Oolong tea corn silk and black soybean seed coat extracts were added as active additive.
@highlight SSWP based films improved the barrier to UV light and increased the antioxidant activities.
@highlight The incorporation of natural extracts could enhance the antioxidant properties of films.
