 Anaerobic ammonium oxidation is a major process of bioavailable nitrogen removal from marine systems . Previously a bacteriohopanetetrol isomer with unknown stereochemistry eluting later than BHT when examined by high performance liquid chromatography was detected in

@highlight Five known bacterial genera produce late eluting bacteriohopanetetrol BHT isomers.
@highlight Four genera including
@highlight Brocadia synthesize BHT with 34
@highlight stereochemistry.
@highlight Only
@highlight Scalindua synthesizes a BHT with unknown stereochemistry BHT 
@highlight BHT 34
@highlight and BHT 
@highlight are separated by GC acetylated and UHPLC non acetylated .
@highlight Acetylated BHT 34
@highlight and BHT 
@highlight could not be resolved by conventional HPLC.
