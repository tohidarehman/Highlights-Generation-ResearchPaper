 A systematic diagnosis study was performed to understand the expansion dynamics and emission characteristics of nanosecondpicosecond collinear double pulse laser induced plasma of aluminum in air at atmospheric pressure by combining shadowgraphy interferometry and spectrometry . The expansions of the shock waves were investigated using shadowgraphic images and their distinctive evolution properties were analyzed including the colliding and merging of picosecond and nanosecond shock waves but more particularly the appearance of a third shock wave and the formation of an interaction layer . The plume expansion and electron density distribution of DP plasma were discussed by comparison with single pulse plasma based on the diagnosis results of interferometry and spectrometry . In addition evolution characteristics of emission spectra of different species in SP and DP cases were also analyzed and evident signal enhancements for atomic and ionic lines were obtained in collinear DP case .
