 Profiling the spatial distributions and dynamic changes of metabolites in plant tissue is critical to elucidate the complex metabolic regulation during plant growth development and responses to abiotic or biotic stresses . In this study we developed a high coverage MALDI MS imaging method to visualize the spatial locations of a wide spectrum of metabolites in
