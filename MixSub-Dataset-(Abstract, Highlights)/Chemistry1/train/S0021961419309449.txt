 Aqueous solubility of acetaminophen in the presence of 1 octyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide 1 butyl 4 methyl pyridinium bromide and 1 octyl 4 methyl pyridinium bromide ionic liquid as co solvent was investigated at different temperatures and mass fraction of ionic liquid . The obtained results reveal that the solubility of acetaminophen was increased by increasing temperature and concentration of ionic liquid . Solubility of ACP was significantly increased when mass fraction of 1 octyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide and 1 octyl 4 methyl pyridinium bromide reaches to more than 0.05 . The possible reasons behind enhanced solubility of ACP in aqueous solution of ionic liquid are hydrophobic interaction and the formed micelles by cations of ionic liquid . Thermodynamic functions of dissolution were calculated by Van t Hoff equation . The experimental solubility of acetaminophen was correlated with the modified Wilson and the electrolyte NRTL models as activity coefficient model .
