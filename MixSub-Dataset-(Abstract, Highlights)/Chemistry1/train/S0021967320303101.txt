 Given the increasing need for analyzing natural or contaminating compounds in complex food matrices in a simple and automated way coupling miniaturized sample preparation techniques with chromatographic systems have become a growing field of research . In this regard given the low extraction efficiency of conventional sorbent phases the development of materials with enhanced extraction capabilities is of particular interest . Here we present several synthesized graphene based materials supported on aminopropyl silica as sorbents for the extraction of xanthines . The synthesized materials were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy . Aminopropyl silica coated with graphene oxide and functionalized with octadecylsilane end capped showed the best performance for xanthines extraction . Hence this material was employed as an in tube solid phase microextraction device coupled online with ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and applied for the analysis of xanthines in roasted coffee samples . Extraction parameters and detection conditions were optimized . The method showed low limits of quantification 0.31.0gL
