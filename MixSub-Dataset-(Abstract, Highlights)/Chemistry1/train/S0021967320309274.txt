 A combined experimental and theoretical study was performed to understand how the pore size of packing materials with pores 60300 in size affects the separation of 550 mer oligonucleotides . For this purpose we developed a model in which the solutes were described as thin rods to estimate the accessible surface area of the solute as a function of the pore size and solute size . First an analytical investigation was conducted in which we found that the selectivity increased by a factor of 2.5 when separating 5 and 15 mer oligonucleotides using packing with 300 rather than 100 pores . We complemented the analytical investigation by theoretically demonstrating how the selectivity is dependent on the column s accessible surface area as a function of solute size . In the preparative investigation we determined adsorption isotherms for oligonucleotides using the inverse method for separations of a 9 and a 10 mer . We found that preparative columns with a 60 pore size packing material provided a 10 increase in productivity as compared with a 300 packing material although the surface area of the 60 packing is as much as five time larger .
