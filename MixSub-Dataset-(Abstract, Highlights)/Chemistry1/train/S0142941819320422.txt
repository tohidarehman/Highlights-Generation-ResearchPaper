 Two end functionalized solution polymerized styrene butadiene rubber was synthesized through anionic polymerization for using in formulation of well dispersed silica compounds with study the wear behavior of the vulcanizates . Polymerization and functionalization were analyzed and confirmed via FT IR GPC and NMR analyses . Novel functionalization using an amine containing agent improved the distribution of silica . With the fine dispersion of silica the wear rate dropped the correlations between vulcanizate abrasion resistance hardness tear strength glass transition temperature and the SEM micrographs of the worn surface were studied . The abrasive stick slip process was the primary wear mechanism and pattern spacing was the least for amino modified vulcanizates . Lower reinforcement caused deep grooves scratches and pits in the non modified sample . The amino functionalized samples had desirable SEM characteristics low hardness more dispersed silica with fewer agglomerates and higher tear strength confirming the higher interaction of silica particles and rubber chains .

@highlight Anionic synthesis of functionalized SBR able to form hydrogen bonds with silica.
@highlight Higher filler dispersion in the matrix due to increased silica rubber interaction.
@highlight A desirable decrease in the hardness concurrent with wear loss decreasing.
@highlight High tear strength resulting in high resistance to crack formation and growth.
@highlight Detection of fine wear characterization from SEM images agreeing wear experiment.
