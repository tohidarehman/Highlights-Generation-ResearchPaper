 A high sampling rate good stability high throughput masking fluorescence detection system with easy positioning of each channel for capillary array electrophoresis was prepared and studied . A special mask combined with convex lenses was designed to modulate signals without using any extra device to position each channel . The signal of each channel was detected by a photomultiplier tube classified and saved by software . The design was used to evidently reduce the rotational vibration of optical components and to stabilize the system so a high sampling rate was obtained by increasing the DC motor speed . To improve the optical system optical fibers instead of conventional bulky optical components were used to transmit optical signal and to collect fluorescences in multiple directions which greatly raised the sensitivity . Other important parameters including sampling rate rotating speed and driven voltage laser diode have also been investigated . Under optimal conditions the performance of the detection system was evaluated . This novel system had a well designed structure and allowed independent multiple capillary operations and easy microanalysis . Its limit of detection for rhodamine 6G was 2.010
