 The purpose of this paper is broadening the understanding of amine solution behaviour through the experimental measurements of density and viscosity in a temperature range from K. The two selected blends are Piperazine Water and Piperazine 2 Dimethylaminoethanol Water . Densities were measured using a vibrating tube densimeter with an expanded uncertainty

@highlight Density and viscosity behavior of PZ and PZ DMAE aqueous solutions is reported.
@highlight Measurements were carried out up to 140MPa and temperatures 293.15393.15 K.
@highlight Data were correlated using Tammann Tait and VFT models for densities and viscosities respectively.
@highlight The fitting results are good and in agreement with the uncertainties.
