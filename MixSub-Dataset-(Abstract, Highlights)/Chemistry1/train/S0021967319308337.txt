 In this work we reported a simple two step method for the synthesis of magnetic mesoporous epoxy resin including one pot template free hydrothermal synthesis of nanoscale amine functionalized magnetic nanoparticles MN NH

@highlight A magnetic mesoporous epoxy resin MMER was prepared by a simple two step method.
@highlight MMER had adequate magnetic responsiveness and thermal stability for rapid separation.
@highlight MMER was used as magnetic solid phase extraction MSPE sorbent for enrichment of bile acids.
@highlight MSPE combined with LCMS MS method was used to monitor 11 kinds of bile acids from serum.
