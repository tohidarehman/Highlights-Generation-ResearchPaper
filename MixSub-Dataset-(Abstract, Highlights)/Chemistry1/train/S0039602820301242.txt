 We use a Tight Binding Ising Model with effective pair interactions depending on concentration able to reproduce the bulk phase diagram of Pt Ag system and in particular its strong asymmetry as a function of composition . This system presents both an L1

@highlight Fitting a Tight Binding Ising Model with effective pair interactions depending on concentration able to reproduce the bulk phase diagram of Pt Ag system in particular its strong asymmetry as a function of composition and the peculiar L1
@highlight ordered phase.

@highlight ordered phase or the Ag rich solid solution as a function of the concentration.
@highlight Prediction of the core shell nanoalloys with silver shell and a core made of Pt rich solid solution ordered L1
@highlight phase or Ag rich solid solution with increasing Silver concentration. A surprising pseudo L1
@highlight phase has been obtained in a narrow composition range slightly lower than the one for the perfect L1
@highlight core where the L1
@highlight phase develops beneath each 111 cluster facets leading to an alternate staking of Ag pure Pt pure concentric layers.
