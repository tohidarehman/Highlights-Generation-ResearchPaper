 Microfibrillar composites with in situ generated short polymeric fibres feature unlike composites containing inorganic rigid fibres particles lower creep resistance in comparison with analogous blends containing spheres . Further attribute is unprecedented decrease in creep resistance of the blend by graphite nanoplatelets . Explanation of this behaviour of the HDPE PA66 GNP system consists in characterization of structure and finite element analysis mapping the effect of reinforcement and interface parameters on creep behaviour . Lowering of reinforcement modulus and its viscoelasticity may lead to worse creep resistance of fibrous composites . FEA also indicates marked negative effect of the soft interface i.e . GNP reduced crystallinity of HDPE near the interface on creep resistance of the spheres reinforced system in contrast to MFC . Structural changes are indicated by polarized light microscopy SEM and TEM . The results reveal so far unknown complexity of the performance of polymer polymer composites which may cause unprecedented antagonistic effects .

@highlight Highlighting of peculiar lower creep resistance of fibrous polymer polymer composites in comparison with spheres reinforcement.
@highlight So far unknown complexity of the performance of multicomponent polymer systems in long term loading.
@highlight Crucial effect of modulus of polymeric reinforcement the interface thickness and parameters being of lower importance.
@highlight The antagonistic effect of the GNP reinforcement on creep of polymeric spheres composite corresponds to GNP created soft interphase.
