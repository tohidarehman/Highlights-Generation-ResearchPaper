 To make use of an O ring under different pressures and temperatures and to procedure predictive numerical simulations of its use it becomes important to identify the O ring behavior under coupled CO

@highlight This method permits to characterize the material used in the structure obtained with industrial process.
@highlight In order to measure the swelling of an elastomer seal under conditions an in situ optical measurement system is used.
@highlight Pressurization and depressurization tests under CO
@highlight and a coupled temperature pressure CO
@highlight test are carried out.
@highlight Non contact measurement method is validated in a thermal expansion test.
@highlight The CO
@highlight sorption and desorption coefficients are independent of pressure but dependent on temperature.
