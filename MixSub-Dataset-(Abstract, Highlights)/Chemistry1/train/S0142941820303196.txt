 Stretchable electronics have attracted great attention in recent years due to low cost physical robustness light weight and potential for multi level integration . However effective methods for analyzing the strains developed in polymer substrates under torsional loading are essential to ensure that the device meets its functional and mechanical requirements . Accordingly the present study proposes two analytical models based on thin plate theory and large deformation assumptions for predicting the in plane strain of polymer substrates with known geometries and material parameters as a function of the torsional loading . It is shown that the predictions of the non linear model which includes 3s order strain components is in excellent agreement with the experimental results obtained by using two optical fiber Bragg gratings attached to the substrate surface . Further experiments are performed to investigate the torsional behavior of polymer substrates with different thicknesses coating films and aspect ratio . The results show that the in plane strain increases with an increasing thickness but decreases with the addition of a thin ITO coating and aspect ratio .
