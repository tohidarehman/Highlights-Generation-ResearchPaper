 The consumption of the polymeric membrane is increased over the years due to the high demand from the industries . This work attempts to evaluate the performance of polyethersulfone membrane incorporated with cellulose nanofibrils which can be extracted from empty fruit bunches generated from palm oil mills . PES CNF polyvinylpyrrolidone blend membranes were fabricated using phase inversion method under the following conditions 16 to 24wt PES 0.2 to 1.2wt CNF and 0.3 to 1.0wt PVP . Response Surface Methodology was employed to optimize the composition of this composite membrane . 80.9L m
