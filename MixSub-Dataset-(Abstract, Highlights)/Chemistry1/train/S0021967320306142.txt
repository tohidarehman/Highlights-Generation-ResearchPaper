 Thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatography mass spectrometry is capable of online measuring speciated organics in atmospheric aerosols . Compared to the one dimensional gas chromatography comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography increases the resolution and the sensitivity mitigates the unresolved complex mixture and co elution occurred in one dimensional gas chromatography . In this study we report a quartz filter based thermal desorption aerosol comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry . It combines a solid state thermal modulator with a quartz filter based thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatography mass spectrometry . The solid state thermal modulator conducts modulation independently from the chromatographic oven without using cryogens or compressed air which makes the system readily adaptive for field measurement . The 2D Q TAG was evaluated using C7 C40 n alkanes and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . It has low limits of detection from 0.001 to 0.104 ng . The instrument was then deployed to measure atmospheric PM

@highlight An online TD GCGC MS was developed for measuring organic aerosols.
@highlight Major aliphatic and aromatic organics were well separated in PM
@highlight in Beijing.
@highlight Time resolved quantification showed dynamic variation of different n alkanes.
