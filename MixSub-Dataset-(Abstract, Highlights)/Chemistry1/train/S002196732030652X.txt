 Since decades cyclodextrins are one of the most powerful selectors in chiral capillary electrophoresis for the enantioseparation of diverse organic compounds . This review concerns papers published over the last decade dealing with the capillary electrophoretic application of single isomer cyclodextrin derivatives in chiral separations . Following a brief overview of their synthetic approaches the inventory of the neutral negatively and positively charged and zwitterionic CD derivatives is presented with insights to underlying structural aspects by NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling . CE represents an ideal tool to study the weak non covalent supramolecular interactions . The published methods are reviewed in the light of enantioselectivity enantiomer migration order and the fine tuning of enantiodiscrimination by the substitution pattern of the single entity selector molecules which is hardly possible for their randomly substituted counterparts . All the reviewed publications herein support that cyclodextrin based chiral capillary electrophoresis seems to remain a popular choice in pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis .
