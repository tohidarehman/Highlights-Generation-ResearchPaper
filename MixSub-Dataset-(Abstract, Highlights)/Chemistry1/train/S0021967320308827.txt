 Based on theory of two site model a subtraction fitting method is proposed to independently fit enantioselective adsorption sites and the nonselective adsorption sites on the surface of chiral stationary phases based on polysaccharide derivatives . Compared with the direct fitting method the method allows independent fitting the isotherm models of two types of adsorption sites . By the SFM the adsorption data of methyl mandelate on the CSP based on cellulose tri was measured . The adsorption on enantioselective sites was well fitted with Langmuir model and the adsorption on nonselective sites was well fitted with Tth model or Langmuir Freundlich model . The adsorption isotherms of the enantiomers of Corey PG lactone diol on chiral stationary phase coated with different amounts of amylose tri W

@highlight A method for independent determination the enantioselective and nonselective adsorption.
@highlight The nonselective adsorption of methyl mandelate has a complex isothermal.
@highlight The selectivity of CLD on the CSPs coated with different amount of chiral selector.
@highlight CSP with low chiral selector coating amounts has high true separation factor.
