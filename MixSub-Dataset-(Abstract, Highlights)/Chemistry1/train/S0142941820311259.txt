 In this work the growth dependence of oriented crystals in isotactic polypropylene including their content orientation and lamellar structures on the thermal treatment temperature is first investigated by

@highlight The growth dependence of oriented crystals on the thermal treatment temperature was studied by
@highlight synchrotron X ray diffraction scattering.
@highlight The thermal treatment temperature was divided into three categories to regulate the growth of oriented crystals.
@highlight The reasons for the dominance of oriented crystals in the temperature range from 155 to 170 is fully elucidated.
@highlight Our work provides a useful strategy to efficiently regulate the content of oriented crystals.
