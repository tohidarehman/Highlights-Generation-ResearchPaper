 The correct identification of the metalloproteins present in human tissues and fluids is essential to our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underpinning a host of health disorders . Separation and analysis of biological samples are typically done

@highlight NH
@highlight NO
@highlight  Tris HCl and NH
@highlight CH
@highlight COO are optimal buffers for use in SEC ICP MS metalloprotein analyses.
@highlight Optimal range of buffer concentration is 50200mM in SEC ICP MS.
@highlight 100mM concentration reduces both protein column interactions and ICP MS maintenance.
@highlight Dextran based columns are best suited for the analysis of apo copper proteins.
