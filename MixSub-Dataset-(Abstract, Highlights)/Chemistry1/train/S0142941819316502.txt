 In this paper an inclined edge cracked short beam specimen subjected to symmetric three point bend loading was designed and examined for conducting mixed mode I II fracture toughness experiments . The aspect ratio and the loading span distance are considered much lower than the other conventional cracked bend beam samples . Crack tip parameters such as stress intensity factors and

@highlight A novel short bend beam specimen was designed for mixed mode fracture investigations.
@highlight Both aspect ratio and span ratio are much lower than other conventional beam specimens.
@highlight Complete mode I II mixities can be produced by the short bend beam specimen.
@highlight Fracture toughness of PMMA was studied experimentally under mixed mode.
@highlight The fracture toughness value was decreased by increasing the contribution of mode II component.
