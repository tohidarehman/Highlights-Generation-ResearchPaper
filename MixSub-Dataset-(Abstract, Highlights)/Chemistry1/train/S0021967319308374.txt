 Absolute quantification of B vitamins in milk is becoming imperative to correlate its impact on child human health . In today s world of changing food habits and environmental pollution there is concern if milk is what we think it to be . In the present work ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry selected reaction monitoring methods have been developed and validated for quantitative estimation of 21 different B vitamins from a drop and B12 from 500L of milk . These two methods qualify all essential bio analytical parameters and are highly reproducible . By using these developed methods B vitamins in different fresh milk samples from cow goat buffalo and pasteurized cow milk each 10 and total

@highlight For the first time 21 B vitamins were quantified from miniscule volume of milk.
@highlight Three different fresh milk samples from cow goat buffalo were compared.
@highlight Total choline is the highest and vitamin B8 is the lowest in all milk samples.
@highlight Inverse correlation between vitamin B2 and B5 was observed in milk samples.
@highlight Total B vitamin and B12 contents are higher in cow milk compared to other two.
