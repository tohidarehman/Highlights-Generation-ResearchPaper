 Exploring new material as adsorbent for the efficient enrichment of pollutants is always of great significance in analytical chemistry . In this work a magnetic azobenzene framework was constructed as a magnetic solid phase extraction adsorbent by a simple and environmentally benign strategy . The MAzo exhibited the attractive features of strong magnetism outstanding adsorption performance as well as good reusability . Combining MAzo based MSPE with high performance liquid phase chromatography a simple and effective method was developed for simultaneous determination of four phenylurea herbicides in pear juice and apple juice samples . Under optimized experimental conditions the method offered low limits of detection of 0.05 0.15 ng mL

@highlight A magnetic azobenzene framework was synthesized by an environmentally benign method.
@highlight The adsorbent displayed good adsorption performance for phenylurea herbicides PUHs .
