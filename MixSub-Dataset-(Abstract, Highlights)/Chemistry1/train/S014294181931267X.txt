 The interfacial interaction between nano silica and rubber matrix is very important for the preparation of high performance rubber composites . In this paper we first proposed the use of TWEEN 20 as a new silica modifier it has four long arms consisting of three polyether chains with terminal hydroxyl group and a fatty chain . The oxygen on the polyether can form a hydrogen bond with the silanol groups on silica surface and the terminal hydroxyl groups can chemically react with the silanol groups without any VOCs . Moreover the long fatty chain can weaken silica polarity to obtain a better compatibility with rubber so that silica modified by TWEEN 20 with chemical reaction and physical absorption can homogeneously disperses in rubber matrix . Nextly we prepared high performance natural rubber composites by adjusting the ratio of TWEEN 20 to TESPT to adjust the physical and chemical interaction between nano silica and rubber molecular chains . The results indicated that the performances including the filler dispersion static mechanical properties and dynamic heating were optimal when the ratio of TESPT to TWEEN 20 was 2 1 . In addition one third of TESPT was replaced by TWEEN 20 to prepare silica rubber composites which can reduce one third of VOCs improve scorchy and achieve high dispersion of silica .

@highlight We found that TWEEN 20 can greatly enhance the dispersion of silica.
@highlight TWEEN 20 modified silica includes chemical reaction and physical absorption effects.
@highlight Surface modification do not change the structure of silica.
@highlight The overall performances of silica natural rubber NR composite is better than TESPT.
@highlight Replacing part of TESPT with TWEEN 20 can reduce VOCs improve scorchy and achieve high dispersion of silica.
