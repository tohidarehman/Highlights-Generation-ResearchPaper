 Silica particles with various pore sizes were modified with poly via surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization under different reaction conditions . Twenty different columns were prepared and characterized according to a test method for hydrophilic interaction chromatography columns . Hydrophilic retention by the SI ATRP columns was much higher than that of poly columns prepared via free radical polymerization and many commercially available HILIC columns . The SI ATRP columns displayed greater selectivity for OH groups than any of the HILIC columns based on their values . SI ATRP functionalization was used to increase the polymer chain density on the silica particles which suggested a brush type morphology and improved hydrophilic selectivity . This indicated that hydrophilic retention and selectivity could be controlled by adjusting the morphology of the organic stationary phase . This stationary phase design strategy was validated experimentally by the effective separation of highly hydrophilic analytes . The findings of this study will greatly contribute to the creation of better separation media .

@highlight 20 Poly acrylamide type columns were synthesized by surface initiated ATRP.
@highlight The new HILIC columns were characterized chromatographically.
@highlight Density of polymer was different on each silica possessing 100 to 300 pores.
@highlight Higher density of the polymer chain around
@highlight  5000 provided higher hydrophilicity.
@highlight 200 Pore was found to be the best to prepare significantly hydrophilic columns.
