 In this study the principle advantages and disadvantages of the three representative chlorophyll fluorescence remote sensing inversion algorithms standard Fraunhofer Line Discrimination 3FLD and improved FLD were compared and analyzed and the inverted Gaussian model fluorescence inversion algorithm was proposed . Vegetation canopy spectral data were simulated by the soil canopy observation photochemistry and energy flux model . The analysis of the simulated and measured spectral data revealed that in contrast to the model parameters of sFLD 3FLD and iFLD those of IGM FLD have definite physical meanings . In addition the apparent reflectance baseline of IGM FLD was more reasonable than that of the other models . Given these properties the fluorescence inversion accuracy of the IGM FLD model was higher than that of the other three models . Moreover it only required the construction of a reflectance baseline in the 680800nm spectral range and can simultaneously invert the fluorescence information of the O

@highlight An inverted Gaussian model IGM based vegetation fluorescence remote sensing inversion algorithm IGM FLD was proposed on the basis of the comparison and analysis of the FLD algorithms.
@highlight The proposed algorithm uses the inverted Gaussian reflectance model to construct the apparent reflectance baseline of the red edge region of vegetation 680800nm spectral range and can simultaneously invert fluorescence intensity at the O2 B and O2 A bands.
@highlight The IGM FLD algorithm shows definite physical meanings because the model has been found to provide an effective quantitative representation of the shape and position of the vegetation red edge reflectance in terms of parameters of physical significance in the manuscript.
