 High transparent and biocompatible hydrogel dressing with bioactivity is attractive for clinical skin repair . Here we report a high optically transparent interpenetrating network hydrogel that was fabricated by sericin and polyacrylamide . The hydrogels possess pH dependent degradation as well as high porosity and porous structures with different sized diameters and distribution . Moreover the swelling behaviors degradation dynamics and mechanical strength can be flexibly regulated by adjusting the content of sericin . In addition the hydrogel system is compatible with hosting cells owing to its excellent cell adhesive capability effectively promoting cell attachment proliferation and long term survival . Together our study demonstrates that the sericin polyacrylamide interpenetrating network hydrogel may serve as a visualized dressing material for real time monitoring of wounds .
