 The thermoplastic vulcanizates of Polylactide Epoxidized natural rubber were prepared by dynamic vulcanization technology . The processing torque crosslink density morphology of PLA ENR blends and PLA s molecular weight during the processing were investigated by HAAKE rheometer swelling measurement scanning electron microscopy and gel permeation chromatography . It was found that the vulcanization of ENR completed at the turning point after torque peak . After the turning point the torque and crosslink density decreased with the processing time increasing . Moreover the morphology of PLA ENR blends showed bi continuous structure during the dynamic vulcanization processing and the phase size of PLA ENR was increased with processing time and temperature . GPC results showed PLA degradation mainly happened after torque turning point . Thermal gravimetric analysis results indicated that some parts of PLA would graft on ENR during processing and the higher the processing temperature the more the PLA was grafted .

@highlight The maximum crosslinking degree of ENR appeared after the peak of processing torque.
@highlight Phase size of PLA ENR TPV increased with processing temperature and time increasing.
@highlight ENR phase was sheared and torn after vulcanization completion.
