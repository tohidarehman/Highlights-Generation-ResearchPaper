 The structure of coadsorption phases formed on Ag by TCNQ with Cs are compared with previously reported coadsorption phases formed with K following investigation by scanning tunnelling microscopy low energy electron diffraction soft X ray photoelectrons spectroscopy and normal incidence X ray standing waves . For each alkali we identify two ordered phases one with an alkali TCNQ stoichiometry of 1 1 and the other 2 1 . STM images show the molecular organisation is the same for Cs and K although only the K

@highlight Coadsorption phases of TCNQ with K and Cs studied by STM LEED NIXSW.
@highlight KTCNQ and CsTCNQ phases both incommensurate and have very similar structures.
@highlight K2TCNQ is commensurate Cs2TCNQ is incommensurate but structures very similar.
@highlight Role of commensuration and relative heights of alkalis and TCNQ in all phases reported and discussed.
