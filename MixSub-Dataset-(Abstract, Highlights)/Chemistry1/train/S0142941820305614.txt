 Rigid polyurethane foams were manufactured using rapeseed oil based polyol with hydroxyl number 270mg KOH g and ground egg shell waste as a natural filler in a single step synthesis procedure . The goal of the study was the investigation of the influence of renewable raw materials on the structure and physico mechanical thermal and biological properties of the final foams . The materials were analyzed using a variety of techniques involving differential scanning calorimetry thermogravimetric analysis infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and computer tomography as well as other methods in accordance to polish and international standards . The results clearly indicate that the modification of the polyurethane composition with the rapeseed oil based polyol and egg shells leads to a beneficial influence on the foam structure . Depending on the renewable raw materials content the modified materials exhibited similar or improved characteristics in comparison to the reference foams obtained using only petrochemical substrates .

@highlight Polyurethane foams were prepared using rapeseed oil based polyol and egg shell waste.
@highlight The structure physico mechanical thermal and biological properties were analyzed.
@highlight Introduction of rapeseed polyol reduced friability and water absorption of the foams.
@highlight Addition of natural polyol increased dimensional and thermal stability of the foams.
@highlight Introduction of egg shell decreased the adhesion of bacteria to the foam surface.
