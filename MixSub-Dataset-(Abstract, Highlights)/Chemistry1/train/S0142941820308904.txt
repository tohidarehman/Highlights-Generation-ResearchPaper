 With the goals of reducing negative environmental impacts and improving the novel food packaging industry edible films composed of Chinese yam mucilage and starch were prepared via a casting method . The films were characterized by analysing the physical morphological mechanical and barrier properties performing a thermal analysis and finally performing an acute toxicity analysis in rats that ingested the film forming solutions . Four film samples were prepared to evaluate the effects of ultrasound and the addition of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose on DOM . DOM films presented a compact and uniform structure without toxicological responses and the optimal DOM film forming solution contained 20.0 mucilage 10.0 starch 1.0 glycerol and 2.0 CMC after a 1h ultrasound treatment . The solubility swelling degree and water vapour permeability of DOM film were 41.11 95.03 and 55.30gmm m
