 A series of copolyimides containing non coplanar alicyclic units combined with fluorinated or rigid aromatic monomer segments is synthesized . The solid film samples display an elevated heat resistance as their degradation started at temperatures around 415C . Introduction into CPI backbone of bicyclic units aromatic aliphatic rings angular bonds and or low polarizable groups determine the variation of the dielectric constant in the range 2.443.04at 100Hz . When using these CPIs as interlayer dielectrics it is revealed that resistance capacitance delay is minimized 10

@highlight New copolyimides interlayer dielectrics with non coplanar alicyclic units were made.
@highlight The films have great thermal stability T
@highlight  415C and adhesion with copper wires.
@highlight The film nanoporous architecture induced low dielectric constant 2.44at 100Hz .
@highlight The low RC delay of samples is adequate for dielectrics in high speed electronics.
