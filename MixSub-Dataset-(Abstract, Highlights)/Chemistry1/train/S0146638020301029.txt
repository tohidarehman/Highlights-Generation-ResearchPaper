 Sulfur incorporation into sedimentary organic matter has a key role in carbon preservation in the geosphere . Such processes can inform strategies for human timescale carbon storage to mitigate climate change impacts and thus more detailed knowledge of sulfur incorporation into biomass species is needed . Until recently detailed chemical characterization of sulfurized organic matter was only possible by analyzing individual building blocks obtained after desulfurization reactions . In this study Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure photoionization in positive ion mode APPI was used to investigate the chemical composition of sulfur rich crude oils and to obtain mechanistic insights into the sulfur incorporation reactions happening during early diagenesis . Contrary to expectations APPI FTICR MS data show that sulfurized lipids with up to 6 sulfur atoms and up to

@highlight Lipids with 6 S atoms have been detected as free molecules in sulfur rich oils.
@highlight Immature sulfur rich oils contain S steroids hopanoids carotenoids alkenones.
@highlight  APPI CID FTICR MS indicated only minor thiols and sulfide bridges.
@highlight Precursor and sulfurized products relationships are clarified.
@highlight Some geoengineering paths to carbon sequestration require such understanding.
