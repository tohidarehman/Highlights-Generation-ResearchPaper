 In this work a new strategy is proposed to improve the performance of poly based organic field effect transistor . The high orientation of P3HT chain is obtained via utilizing precipitation characteristics of P3HT in volatile CH

@highlight P3HT based OFET performance is enhanced by mixing the volatile CH
@highlight Cl
@highlight with slight high boiling point good solvent ODCB .
@highlight Controlling P3HT precipitation speed can prolong chain crystallization time and reduce film surface roughness effectively.
@highlight P3HT OFET based blended solvent increases 20 fold in mobility and three orders of magnitude in on off ratio.
