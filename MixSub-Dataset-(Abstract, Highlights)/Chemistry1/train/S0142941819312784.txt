 The process dependence of pressure specific volume temperature measurement for an amorphous polymer acrylonitrile butadiene styrene was investigated . The influences of different measurement processes were considered in the pvT measurements . The pvT measurements of isobaric cooling and heating with different cooling and heating rates and isothermal compression and decompression with different compression and decompression rates were conducted . The testing temperature ranged between 40 and 230C and the pressure ranged between 20 and 2200bar . The obtained results demonstrated that the pvT diagram will be significantly different depending on the direction in which the pressure or temperature is changing and also on the rate of the change . Isobaric pvT diagrams are different between cooling and heating . Fast cooling accelerates phase transitions while fast heating reverses . Specific volume at the same pressure and temperature in decompression process is lower than that in compression . Compression and decompression leads to different pvT curves . Compression and decompression rates have different effects on specific volume in different states .
