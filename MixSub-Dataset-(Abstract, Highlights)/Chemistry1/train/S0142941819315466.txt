 Chitosan based membranes are among the most effective and efficient PEMs for fuel cells however their low proton conductivity needs to be improved . In this study chitosan chloroacetate chitosan chitosan blend with epoxidized natural rubber and CCS with ENR blend based membranes were prepared by solution casting crosslinked with NaOH and H

@highlight Chitosan considered one of the most effective and efficient polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cell however due to low proton conductivity it is necessary to enhance its proton conductivity.
@highlight Chitosan was modified by blending it with chloroacetic acid and Epoxidized Natural rubber.
@highlight The membranes were prepared by solution casting technique.
@highlight The characterization of the membrane took place by using ATR FTIR AFM LCR meter and OCA to determine functional groups surface roughness electrical properties and contact angle.
