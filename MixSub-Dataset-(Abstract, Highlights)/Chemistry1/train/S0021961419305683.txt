 It is well known that alcohol beverages are mainly composed by the two core water and ethanol components . 1 propanol and 2 propanol which are the so called ethanol congeners change the physicochemical properties of the binary liquid mixture when present even at small concentration . New accurate density values were obtained for the ternary and binary and liquid mixtures at 293.15K and 0.1MPa . Three dimensional representations of the excess molar and partial molar volumes are presented and interpreted in terms of H bonding packing branching and hydrophobic hydrophilic balance . The branching effect was assessed by the comparison with the ternary system where 1 propanol is substituted by its bulkier isomer 2 propanol .

@highlight New density data of the ternary water ethanol 1 propanol mixtures is presented.
@highlight Use of Cibulka equation to fit excess molar volumes.
@highlight Excess partial molar volumes of the alcohols reveal that 1 propanol has higher impact in the total volume.
@highlight The hydrophobic hydrophilic balance shifts to the hydrophobic side with the addition of 1 propanol.
