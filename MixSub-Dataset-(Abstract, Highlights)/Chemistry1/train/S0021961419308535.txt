 The dissolution behavior of naftopidil in methanol ethanol ethyl acetate toluene acetone acetonitrile and two mixtures of and was studied . In pure and mixed solvents the solubility was determined experimentally and correlated by some thermodynamic models . The maximum data was obtained at 313.15K in toluene and the minimum data was obtained at 273.15K in acetonitrile . Moreover there is co solvence phenomenon in two co solvent mixtures the values increased monotonically with the increasing temperature while increased with increasing co solvent mass fraction

@highlight Research the dissolution behavior of naftopidil in pure and mixed solvents.
@highlight Extended Hildebrand Solubility Approach was used to explain co solvence phenomenon.
@highlight The solubility data were correlated by some thermodynamic models.
@highlight Some apparent thermodynamic properties were evaluated.
