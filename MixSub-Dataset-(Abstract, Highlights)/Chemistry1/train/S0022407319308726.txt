 Clouds are a kind of atmospheric factor that most effectively scatters the artificial light coming from the ground . Therefore they have the most significant impact on the brightness of the night sky . The paper analyses the influence of both the level of cloudiness as well as the genera of clouds and altitude of its base on amplifying of the light pollution . The impact of cloudiness on the brightness of the night sky in places with different levels of light pollution was researched . Measurements of meteorological elements were used together with clouds genera assessments . The introduction of an innovative method of identifying some genera of clouds on the base of the all night continuous measurements of the sky s brightness allowed for a similar analysis in the absence of observational data specifying the genera of clouds .

@highlight Clouds are the main factor of ecological light pollution.
@highlight There is a clear linear dependence of the night sky brightness and the cloudiness.
@highlight There are three groups of light polluted areas connected to the population density.
@highlight Night sky brightness depends on the clouds genus.
@highlight Brightness of the night sky depends on the altitude of clouds base.
