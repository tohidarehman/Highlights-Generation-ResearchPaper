 In this study we use an artificial neural network method to estimate the downward surface shortwave radiation over China from Himawari 8 geostationary satellite data . As the training data of the DSSR estimation algorithm ground observed DSSR data is compiled to complete the ANN method . GOS data from 89 stations over mainland China in 2016 are divided into training testing and validation samples with a proportion of 3 1 1 in order to perform the DSSR estimation and accuracy validation . As a result estimated DSSR from Himawari 8 data in 2016 shows good consistency with validation samples of ground observed DSSR holding the determination coefficient and root mean square error of 0.90 and 88.86Wm

@highlight The ANN algorithm model can quickly and accurately calculate the hourly SSR by directly connect the satellite data and in situ SSR measurements in a simple way rather than the complex scheme based on the lookup table estimation approach.
@highlight The ANN model was applied to Himawari 8 geostationary satellite data and the estimated SSR show a good agreement with in situ observation.
@highlight We analyze the spatio temporal characteristics of SSR in China on the hourly daily and monthly scale in 2016. The previous studies have less to analyze the characteristics of SSR spatio temporal at the daily scale especially at the hourly scale.
