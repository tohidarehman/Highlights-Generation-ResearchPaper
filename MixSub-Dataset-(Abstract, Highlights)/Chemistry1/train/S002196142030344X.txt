 In carbon capture utilization and storage a thorough understanding of thermophysical behaviour of the candidate fluid is an essential requirement for accurate design and optimised operation of the processes . In this communication vapour liquid equilibrium data of the binary mixtures of CO CO

@highlight VLE data for CO
@highlight  CO at 253 to 298K.
@highlight Results compared to the PR classical and WS mixing rules EoS GC and GERG EoSs.
@highlight EoS GC with the specific departure function is superior to other models.
