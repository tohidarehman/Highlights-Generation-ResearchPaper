 One of the main challenges in membrane gas separation is the plasticizing effect that reduces selectivity . For a better understanding of this phenomenon the knowledge of the sorption behavior of each component of the mixture is necessary . For this purpose the sorption thermosyphon apparatus was successfully designed and tested with gas sorption measurements . One of the main advantages of the STA compared to actual other methods is to ensure concentration uniformity at the headspace using a thermosiphon as pressure decay is recorded . The equilibrium condition is not disturbed during the sampling and allow the obtention of accurate data at the end of the sorption experiment . To validate the novel system the sorption diffusion and permeation coefficients of pure CO2 and CH
