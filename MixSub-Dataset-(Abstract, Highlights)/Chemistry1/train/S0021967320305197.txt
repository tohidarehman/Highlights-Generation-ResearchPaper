 Synthetic opioids are responsible for numerous overdoses and fatalities worldwide . Currently fentanyl and its analogs are also mixed with heroin cocaine and methamphetamine or sold as oxycodone hydrocodone and alprazolam in counterfeit medications . Microextraction techniques became more frequent in analytical toxicology over the last decade . A method to simultaneously quantify nine synthetic opioids fentanyl sufentanil alfentanil acrylfentanyl thiofentanyl valerylfentanyl furanylfentanyl acetyl fentanyl and carfentanil and two metabolites norfentanyl and acetyl norfentanyl in urine samples by microextraction with packed sorbent and liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated . A multivariate optimization was performed to establish the number and speed of draw eject sample cycles and the extraction solvent . The best extraction condition was eight draw eject sample cycles with a velocity of 3.6 L sec and acetonitrile as elution solvent . Linearity was achieved between 1 to 100 ng mL with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng mL and limit of quantification of 1 ng mL . Imprecision and bias were less than 12.8 and 5.7 respectively . The method had good specificity and selectivity when challenged with 10 different matrix sources and 36 pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse at concentrations of 100 or 500 ng mL . The method was successfully applied to authentic urine samples . MEPS was an efficient semi automatic extraction technique requiring small volumes of organic solvents and sample . The cartridges can be cleaned and reused .
