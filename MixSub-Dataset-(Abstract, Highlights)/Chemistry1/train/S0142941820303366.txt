 The preparation of a new nanocomposite by combining zein and quantum dots was the main interest of the present work . By the sol gel method colloidal ethanolic dispersions of zinc oxide particles and ZnO particles doped with magnesium were obtained sized 4.26 and 3.65nm respectively as determined by UVVis spectroscopy . The prepared QDs were used as nanofillers in order to obtain zein based nanocomposite films which displayed good visual appearance homogeneity and transparency . The presence of QDs increased the hydrophobicity and reduced up to three times the amount of water uptake of the composite films when compared to pure zein . Those effects were more pronounced for ZnO Mg QDs . TEM FTIR and fluorescence microscopy analysis indicated that zein interacts more effectively with ZnO Mg than with ZnO . In addition and most importantly the presence of QDs in the films showed an important advantage when compared to those of pure zein the extended UV blocking in the absorbance spectra . The antimicrobial assays demonstrated that the ZnO NPs loaded into zein films are promising antibacterial materials since the inhibition of growth of
