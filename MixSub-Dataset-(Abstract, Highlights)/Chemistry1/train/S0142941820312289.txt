 In this study poly lactic acid based nanocomposites containing perlite nanoparticles were prepared by melt mixing method . Various characterization techniques were employed to evaluate the performance PLA nanoperlite nanocomposites . The nanocomposites were characterized via FTIR to investigate the functional groups and chemical structure of the nanocomposites . Thermal properties of the nanocomposites examined by DSC showed that the increase of nano perlite content in the PLA matrix reduces the crystallinity and melting temperature of the nanocomposites . The rheological studies indicated that both of storage and loss modulus are increased when the nanoperlite is added up to 5wt . However the modulus is reduced in samples containing more than 5wt nanoparticle due to their agglomeration . The in vitro degradation studies of the nanocomposites at elevated and normal temperatures showed hydrolytic degradation around 1315 months . The surface behavior results implied that the water contact angle values exhibit a reducing trend when the nanoperlite content increases up to 3wt which can be related to the decreased crystallinity of PLA and also to the hydrophilic nature of perlite . Moreover the adhesion of osteoblast cells and their viability on an electrospun scaffold made of optimized sample showed the initial implications of potential applications of the nanocomposites in bone regeneration and biomedical applications . These multipurpose nanocomposites can also be used for packaging applications .
