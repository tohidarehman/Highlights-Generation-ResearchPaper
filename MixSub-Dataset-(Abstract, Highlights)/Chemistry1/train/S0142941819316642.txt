 A concept for taking a sample from a polymer melt stream plus the direct processing of this melt to specimen is presented . Therefore a melt sampling and direct injection molding device was developed . Process parameters were studied and the set up was implemented successfully . Using the MSIM device different thermoplastics were processed and provided specimen characterized . The mechanical material properties from samples of the MSIM process show a good consistency compared with data from conventional processes . The MSIM device can be used in production processes for quality control e.g . color or mechanical properties as well as in the field of research and development to reduce development cycles .

@highlight A device for taking a sample from a polymer melt stream and subsequent production of specimen was developed.
@highlight Trials with different thermoplastics show the possibility of melt processing without interrupting the compounding process.
@highlight The developed device works for unfilled and filled materials.
@highlight Tested specimen show a good reproducibility and consistency compared with data from conventional process.
@highlight The device can be used in industry for quality control as well as in the field of research for material development.
