 Waterfowl populations have been decreasing in Europe for the last years and pollution appears to be one of the main factors . This study was conducted to develop a single sensitive and robust analytical method for the monitoring of 2 fungicides 15 herbicides 3 insecticides and 24 transformation products in wild bird eggs . One of the major challenges addressed was the characterization of chemicals with large logP range . A total of 11 different extraction parameters were tested in triplicate to optimize the extraction protocol on generic parameters buffer addition and use of clean up steps . Quantification was based on matrix match approach with hen eggs as reference matrix . Particular attention was payed to matrix effects quantification limits 0.5 to 25ng.g

@highlight Development of a multi residue analysis method for 44 pesticides and TP in eggs.
@highlight Six critical parameters of the sample extraction protocol were fully studied.
@highlight Extraction recoveries were superior to 50 even for the most polar TP.
@highlight Inter day precision relative standard deviations were inferior to 22 at LOQ.
