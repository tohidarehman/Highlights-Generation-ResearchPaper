 In this work a Low Density Polyethylene Ethylene Vinyl Acetate polymeric blend with antimicrobial activity was obtained . The main objective was to develop an antibacterial LDPE EVA polymeric blend from the incorporation of antibacterial nanoparticles to increase the antimicrobial and sanitary safety of this polymeric blend when applied in the manufacture of medical products . The antibacterial activity was obtained from the incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles in the LDPE EVA polymeric blends and the thermal properties were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and the mechanical properties by tensile stress tests for different percentages of ZnO NPs . Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the morphological characteristics of the ZnO NPs and also the characteristics of the distribution of nanoparticles in the polymer blends . The dispersive energy of x ray fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the chemical composition of the nanoparticles . Microbiological tests were performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the LDPE EVA polymeric blends without and with ZnO NPs against the bacteria

@highlight LDPE EVA with antibacterial activity were obtained by the incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles.
@highlight Nanoparticles of zinc oxide were incorporated into LDPE EVA and the thermal properties did not show significant changes.
@highlight The incorporation of the zinc oxide nanoparticles improved the flexibility of the LDE EVA blends.
@highlight The incorporation of the zinc oxide nanoparticles not modified significantly the tensile strength of the antibacterial LDPE EVA blends.
@highlight The antibacterial LDPE EVA blends with zinc oxide nanoparticle were able to eliminate the bacteria with just 2 h.
