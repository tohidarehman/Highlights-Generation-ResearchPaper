 An expression for peak compression factor based on temporal peak widths is proposed which can be measured directly . The relationship between it and peak compression factor based on spatial peak widths is given . The experimental data presented in the Neue s work are reevaluated . The peak compression factor is recalculated by taking into account the curvature in the plot of logarithmic retention factor ln

@highlight A peak compression factor 
@highlight  based on temporal peak widths is proposed.
@highlight The variation in plate number 
@highlight  with mobile phase composition 
@highlight  is considered.
@highlight The curvature in the plot of logarithmic retention factor ln
@highlight  vs.
@highlight is considered.
@highlight The discrepancy between experimental and predicted values of
@highlight is reduced.
@highlight The relationship between
@highlight s obtained under ideal and real situation is given.
