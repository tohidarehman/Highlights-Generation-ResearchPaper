 A sensitive and selective method was developed and validated for the determination of 26 anticoccidial compounds in surface and groundwater samples at parts per quadrillion pgL

@highlight Highly polar and other anticoccidials can be separated on one analytical column.
@highlight SPE allows for the efficient isolation of 26 anticoccidials from water.
@highlight Validation has proven the method s applicability to surface and groundwaters.
@highlight The method s detection capability ranges from ppq pgL
@highlight  to ppt ngL
@highlight  levels.
