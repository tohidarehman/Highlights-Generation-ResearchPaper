 Relations are discussed which provide a solution of the problem of the precise abundance determination of isotopologues in a gas mixture . Numerical values of necessary coefficients of these relations are obtained for some polyatomic asymmetric top molecules H

@highlight General method for determination of partial pressure of isotopologue in a gaseous mixture is presented.
@highlight Simple relation is derived which allows to predict with a high accuracy effective dipole moment parameters of different species.
@highlight Quantitative values of parameters in this relation are determined for a number of isotopologues of different asymmetric top molecules.
