 A negative relation between strength and crystallinity is observed in polylactic acid below glass transition temperature . Study indicates that entangled molecules in amorphous regions act as load bearing structures and are responsible for stress induced crazing . A three phase model is proposed to explain how amorphous fraction changes with heat treatments and contributes to polymer modulus below glass transition temperature . Incorporation of carbon quantum dots into amorphous fraction dominated PLA creates a new type of luminescent composites that can be used for food labelling tracking packaging and production of origin .

@highlight A contrary relationship is realized between strength and crystallinity of polylactic acid PLA below glass transition temperature.
@highlight Entangled molecules in amorphous regions act as load bearing structures and are responsible for stress induced crazing.
@highlight Incorporation of carbon quantum dots into amorphous PLA creates a new type of luminescent composites that show a great potential in tracking coding and packaging for production of origin.
