 Exopolysaccharides are considered as omnipresent and abundant bioproducts . However the diversity of cyanobacteria offers a great opportunity for discovering new bioproducts as they are not properly explored . The current work targeted to characterize an indigenous cyanobacterial strain CCC 746 isolated from Bishnupur India for production of exo polysaccharides . The molecular and microscopic observation stated that the isolated cyanobacteria is
