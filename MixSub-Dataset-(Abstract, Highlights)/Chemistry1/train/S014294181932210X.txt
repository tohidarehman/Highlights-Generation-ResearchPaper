 Nowadays scientific and technological efforts are being carried out to diminish serious ecological problems caused by indiscriminate use of non biocompostable polymers in the packaging industry . In this sense novel biodegradable blends of different composition based on poly poly and tributyrin are developed and here proposed as an eco friendly alternative . Materials are characterized by fracture experiments under quasi static and biaxial impact loading . Fracture behavior is analyzed together with thermal tensile and water permeation properties to evaluate their potential in service performance . TB PLA PHB blends with 15wt TB exhibit better permeation and fracture toughness than currently used bio based polymers being in the range of polyethylene properties . Results highlight the potential of these new blends broadening the current application field of PLA .

@highlight Novel biodegradable blends are developed as an alternative eco friendly packaging.
@highlight PLA is mixed with PHB and plasticized with TB to enhance its properties.
@highlight PHB and TB addition turn out PLA fracture behavior from brittle to ductile.
@highlight PLA PHB TB blends exhibit vapor permeation similar to that of PLA.
@highlight PLA PHB TB blends are flexible and tough films suitable for packaging.
