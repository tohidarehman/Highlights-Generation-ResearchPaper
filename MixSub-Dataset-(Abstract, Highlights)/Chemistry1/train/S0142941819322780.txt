 Dynamic mechanical analysis is a technique used to determine the viscoelastic properties of polymers and their composites . The storage modulus loss modulus and loss factor in correlation with the glass transition temperature can be detected by several means . In this study these properties are determined using a dynamic mechanical analyzer in 3 point bending mode as well as a rheometer in torsion mode . The materials under consideration are a unidirectional glass fiber reinforced epoxy a quasi isotropic carbon fiber reinforced epoxy and a quasi isotropic glass fiber reinforced epoxy . The results of each method and material are presented and the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed . 3 point bending proved to be more suitable to detect the effect of fiber orientation for unidirectional fiber reinforced epoxy but requires careful control of sample dimensions for accuracy . Torsion on the other hand gave consistent measurements for samples of varying lengths proving to be a suitable method if materials are scarce and limited .
