 With the urgent need to provide an efficient and reliable protection for people from fatal chemical and biological weapons our fundamental understanding of how toxins interact with filters is far from complete . The situation is further complicated by natural difficulties of performing experimental measurements with lethal toxins . Unlike experiments computational modeling offers an attractive and safe yet reliable way of studying behavior of toxic agents on a variety of substrates at a great level of detail . Here we report DFT based quantum chemical calculations of adsorption and decomposition of DMMP sarin and soman on MoO

@highlight The first comprehensive study of decomposition of sarin and soman on a metal oxide.
@highlight MoO
@highlight adsorbs toxic nerve agents and quickly decomposes them.
@highlight MoO
@highlight serves as an efficient substrate able of degrading toxins.
@highlight Comparative predictive analysis of adsorption of toxins on an oxide is performed.
@highlight Details of chemical decomposition of sarin and soman on metal oxide are discovered.
