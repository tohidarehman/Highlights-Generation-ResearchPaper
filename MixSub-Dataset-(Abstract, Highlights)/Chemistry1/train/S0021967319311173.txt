 Diffusion inside pores is the rate limiting step in many preparative chromatographic separations and a key parameter for process design in weak interaction aqueous chromatographic separations employed in food and bio processing . This work aims at relating diffusion inside porous networks to properties of stationary phase and of diffusing molecules . Intraparticle diffusivities were determined for eight small molecules in nine different stationary phases made from three different backbone materials . Measured intraparticle diffusivities were compared to the predictive capability of the correlation by Mackie and Meares and the parallel pore model . All stationary phases were analyzed for their porosity apparent pore size distribution and tortuosity which are input parameters for the models . The parallel pore model provides understanding of the occurring phenomena but the input parameters were difficult to determine experimentally . The model predictions of intraparticle diffusion were of limited accuracy . We show that prediction can be improved when combining the model of Mackie and Meares with the fraction of accessible pore volume . The accessible pore volume fraction can be determined from inverse size exclusion chromatographic measurements . Future work should further challenge the improved model specifically widening the applicability to greater accessible pore fractions with corresponding higher intraparticle diffusivities
