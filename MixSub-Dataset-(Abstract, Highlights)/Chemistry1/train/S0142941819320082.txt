 This paper investigates the effects of crosslinking methods on the incorporation of graphene oxide in carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber in the process of producing nanocomposites for chemical resistant protective clothing and gloves . The novel aspect of the study is a comprehensive approach involving both unmodified GO as well as GO that was carboxylated to increase its affinity to XNBR and to facilitate its application . The nanostructure of XNBR composites was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to elucidate the chemical structure of the composites . Thermal stability studies were performed using differential scanning calorimetry . The barrier properties of the composites were determined based on swelling crosslinking density and permeation by mineral oils . The mechanical tests included resistance to puncture and abrasion stress at strain and tensile strength . Contact angle was measured to determine the degree of hydrophobicity of the obtained composites .

@highlight Hybrid crosslinking of XNBR leads to the creation of a dualistic network structure with sulfide bridges and ionic bonds.
@highlight Unfilled XNBR cured with sulfur only is the most hydrophobic material.
@highlight Incorporation of GO modified with carboxylic groups to XNBR led to an improvement in mechanical properties.
@highlight Crosslinking density shows a correlation with degree of swelling and tensile tests.
@highlight Application of graphene oxide promote surface uniformity of composites.
