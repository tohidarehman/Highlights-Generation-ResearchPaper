 monitoring of resin flow impregnation of carbon fiber fabrics and curing during composite manufacturing are very important for determining the quality of composite parts . In conventional methods sensors such as optical fibers and strain gages are bonded to or embedded in the composites for measuring the changes in mechanical and chemical properties . Although they can detect resin curing behavior and impregnation of carbon fibers they may adversely affect the manufacturing process or structural integrity of the composites . In this study carbon fiber itself was used as a sensor that minimizes the degradation of mechanical properties and increases the efficiency of monitoring the manufacturing process . The change in the electrical resistance of carbon fiber fabrics was monitored during the various manufacturing processes when the resin flowed through the carbon fiber fabric and curing progressed . The effectiveness of this monitoring method was confirmed and it is expected to be applicable in monitoring the quality of the finished composite parts .
