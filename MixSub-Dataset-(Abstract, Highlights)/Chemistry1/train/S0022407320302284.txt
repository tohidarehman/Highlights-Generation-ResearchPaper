 In this paper all electron relativistic MRCI Q calculation has been carried out on electronic and spectroscopic properties of SbCl . In present calculation total 34 S and 74 have been reliably characterized for the first time . The lowest three S states X

@highlight Total 34 S states of SbCl are accurately characterized at the MRCI Q level.
@highlight The SOC effect makes 34 S states split into 74 states.
