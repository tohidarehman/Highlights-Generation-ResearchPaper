 Light pollution poses a growing threat to optical astronomy in addition to its detrimental impacts on the natural environment the intangible heritage of humankind related to the contemplation of the starry sky and potentially on human health . The computation of maps showing the spatial distribution of several light pollution related functions is a key tool for light pollution monitoring and control providing the scientific rationale for the adoption of informed decisions on public lighting and astronomical site preservation . The calculation of such maps from satellite radiance data for wide regions of the planet with sub kilometric spatial resolution often implies a huge amount of basic pixel operations requiring in many cases extremely large computation times . In this paper we show that using adequate geographical projections a wide set of light pollution map calculations can be reframed in terms of two dimensional convolutions that can be easily evaluated using conventional fast Fourier transform algorithms with typical computation times smaller than 10

@highlight A wide class of night sky brightness maps can be efficiently and accurately computed by means of fast fourier transforms FFT .
@highlight A necessary condition is that the light pollution point spread function be shift invariant. The calculation of the 2D map then becomes a convolution.
