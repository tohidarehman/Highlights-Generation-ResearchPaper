 Seed mediated growth is a promising technique for preparation of multi metallic nanostructures in which reduction of metal ions takes a place over the surface of another one . Herein a seed growth mechanism was investigated for synthesis of core shell AgAuPd ternary nanostructures through a facile method at room temperature . Ascorbic acid and sodium alginate were used as nano generator and stabilizing agent respectively . Spherical shaped monocular Ag nanostructure with size of 13.6nm grew to 24.4nm of AgAu binary and to 58.8nm of AgAuPd ternary core shell nanostructures . The crystalline shape of nanostructures was approved by X Ray diffraction analyses . While FT IR data approved the redox mechanism for synthesis the as required nanostructures . The catalytic reactivity of the prepared nanostructures in reductive degradation of methylene blue dye was studied . The results approved the role of Pd in perfection of catalytic degradation of the as tested dye . The rate constant of dye degradation was considerably enlarged from 62.110
