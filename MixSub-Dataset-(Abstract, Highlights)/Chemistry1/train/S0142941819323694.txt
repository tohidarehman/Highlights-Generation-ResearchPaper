 In order to identify suitable flame retardant additives for the eco friendly polymer cellulose acetate high melting derivatives of the known flame retardant 9 10 dihydro 9 oxa 10 phosphaphenanthrene 10 oxide were combined with the thermoplastic CA and the combustion properties were tested . CA mixtures with bis phosphonamidates showed distinct flame retardation effects and a reduction of peak heat release rates by up to 18 . CA mixtures with MDOP a melamine salt of DOPA also showed considerable effects and a reduction of PHRR by up to 27 . While producing more smoke than pure CA and CA plus melamine owing to its aromatic component MDOP was superior to the CA mixtures with DOPO EDA DOPO and PIP DOPO in this regard . The mixture of CA with melamine gave rise to a distinctly reduced formation of toxic CO and smoke when compared with pure CA . Thus these additives can be considered for future applications of CA based polymers with enhanced flame protection .

@highlight Cellulose acetate mixtures with DOPO derivatives showed significantly reduced heat release.
@highlight Mixtures of cellulose acetate with MDOP showed the lowest heat release.
@highlight Char formation was observed for mixtures with DOPO derivatives upon combustion.
@highlight Melamine admixture distinctly reduced CO formation during combustion.
@highlight Considerable residual masses were observed for mixtures with DOPO derivatives at high temperatures.
