 Sodium and potassium ions have an important role in controlling the blood pressure in the body . Potassium ion along with sodium ion regulates the water and the acid base balances in the tissues and blood . In this work solute solvent interactions in the aqueous solutions containing the guaifenesin drug NaCl and KCl salts were studied . To reach this purpose the density and electrical conductivity data for GG drug in water and aqueous solutions of NaCl and KCl were measured within salt and drug molality range of molkg
