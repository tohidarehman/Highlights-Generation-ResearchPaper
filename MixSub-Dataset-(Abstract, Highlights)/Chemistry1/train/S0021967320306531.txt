 The potential of continuous bioprocessing is hindered by the bottlenecks of chromatography processing which continues to be executed in batch mode . Highlighting the critical drawbacks of batch chromatography this review underscores the transition that the industry has made by implementing continuous upstream process without devising a working model for downstream chromatography operations . Even though multitude of process development initiatives have commenced the review emphasizes the first principle models of chromatography on which these initiatives are built . Various models of continuous chromatography which are essential but not limited to multi column systems employed to congeal a unified process are reviewed . Advancements made by several mechanistic models and simulations to maximize productivity and performance are described in an attempt to provide the integral tools . The modeling tools can be used for development of a strong model based control strategy and can be embedded into the continuous chromatography framework . The review addresses the limitations and challenges of the current modeling methods for development of robust mechanistic modeling and efficient unit operation platform in continuous chromatography .
