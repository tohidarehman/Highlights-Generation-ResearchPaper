 Experimental molar heat capacities at atmospheric pressure have been determined for the mixture carvacrol ethanol every 10K in the temperature interval K and over the entire composition range with a Calvet type calorimeter . Densities necessary for determining isobaric heat capacities and ultrasonic speed of sound have been also measured at the same conditions . From these properties isobaric thermal expansivities isentropic compressibilities isothermal compressibilities internal pressures and isochoric molar heat capacities have been calculated . Furthermore in order to complete our thermophysical study the corresponding excess properties have been calculated and discussed in terms of molecular interactions . Finally excess molar isobaric heat capacities have been calculated with COSMO RS and compared to the experimental values .

@highlight  and
@highlight were determined for mixtures carvacrol ethanol between 298.15328.15 K at 0.101MPa.
@highlight and C
@highlight were calculated for mixtures carvacrol ethanol as well as all the involved excess properties.
@highlight are sigmoidal shaped in the whole composition range and increase as temperature rises.
@highlight The values of excess properties point to stronger interactions in the mixture than in the pure compounds.
@highlight COSMO RS was applied to predict
