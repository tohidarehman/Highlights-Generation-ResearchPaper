 The Lower Permian Irati Formation in the northeastern and central eastern Paran Basin was investigated in terms of bulk and molecular organic geochemistry in order to enlighten the complex depositional paleoenvironment during deposition of Irati black shales . The geochemical data reflect temporal and spatial variations of freshwater incursions promoting salinity stratification and high primary productivity in surface waters with the establishment of photic zone euxinia . Overall highly concentrated C

@highlight Algal bloom events reconstructed by detection of C
@highlight long chain alkylnaphthalene.
@highlight Freshwater inflows in the Irati Sea retraced by variation in MTTCs distribution.
@highlight Water column stratification reflected by the occurrence of tetrahydrophenanthrene.
@highlight The detection of aliphatic carotenoids series allows paleosalinity reconstructions.
@highlight Development of Photic Zone Euxinia pointed out by detection of aryl isoprenoids.
