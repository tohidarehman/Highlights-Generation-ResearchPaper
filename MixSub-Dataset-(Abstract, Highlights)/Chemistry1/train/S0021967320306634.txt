 A simple and efficient magnetic solid phase extraction method was established with magnetic covalent organic framework as adsorbent to enrich organophosphorus pesticides from fatty milk samples followed by the sensitive determination via LC MS MS . The key parameters influencing the MSPE efficiency were comprehensively investigated to afford an optimized procedure . All the target analytes could be captured directly by magnetic COF from milk without protein precipitation making the pretreatment rapid and convenient . Systematic method validation demonstrated its satisfactory linearity recoveries and precision . The method limits of quantification were 0.2 0.5 g L
