 Electron tomography is used to reconstruct the exact 3 dimensional morphologies of fractal like soot aggregates sampled from a household heating stove commonly used in China . Conventional ET techniques suffer from the missing wedge problem caused by unreachable tilt angles leading to noisy reconstructed tomograms . We overcame this problem by implementing a high resolution object edge identification method coupled with a novel voxel filling algorithm to improve the reconstruction quality . Our reconstructed micron length aggregates highlight the local non idealities present throughout a particle s surface these characteristics are almost impossible to account for in existing computational simulation exercises . Q space analysis predicts the fractal dimension of our ET reconstructed aggregates to be in the range between 2.2 and 2.6 which deviates significantly from the universal value of 1.8 obtained using the widely adopted diffusion limited cluster cluster aggregation model . The optical properties of our ET reconstructed aggregates are compared with those built with a DLCA model and equivalent spheres . The most striking optical characteristics of the ET reconstructed aggregates are their wavelength invariant mass absorption cross sections of 3.5 m
