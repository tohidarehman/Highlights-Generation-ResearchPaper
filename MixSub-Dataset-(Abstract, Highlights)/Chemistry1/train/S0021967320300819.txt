 A novel chiral stationary phase was prepared through the reaction of surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization by the copolymerization of thermoresponsive

@highlight A smart thermoresponsive CSP was prepared by copolymerization of cyclodextrin and
@highlight  isopropylacrylamide.
@highlight The hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of CSP can be switched by changing column temperature.
@highlight The enantioselectivity of enantiomers can be modulated on the chiral column.
@highlight The prepared column could further be used to separate benzene compounds.
