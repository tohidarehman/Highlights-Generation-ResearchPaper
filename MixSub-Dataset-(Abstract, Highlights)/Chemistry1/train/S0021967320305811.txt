 The chromatographic performances of four coated and immobilized amylose phenylcarbamate based chiral columns were evaluated and compared under normal phase elution conditions by using chiral 4 4 bipyridine derivatives as analytes .

@highlight Enantioseparation of 3 3 5 5 tetrachloro 2 iodo 2 substituted 4 4 bipyridines.
@highlight Comparative enantioseparations on coated and immobilized amylose based selectors.
@highlight Effect of introducing methanol in the mobile phase is described.
@highlight Temperature dependent enantiomer elution order reversal was observed.
