 Herein a sensitive and green method combining dispersive micro solid phase extraction and homogeneous liquid liquid microextraction has been developed . Magnetic layered double hydroxide nanoparticals were prepared and used as adsorbents in

@highlight D SPE coupled with SHS based HLLME for the pretreatment of NSAIDs in water samples.
@highlight Magnetic LDH material as a dissolvable sorbent without need of elution step.
@highlight Application of SHS as a green alternative extractant.
@highlight The proposed method is sensitive time saving and eco friendly.
