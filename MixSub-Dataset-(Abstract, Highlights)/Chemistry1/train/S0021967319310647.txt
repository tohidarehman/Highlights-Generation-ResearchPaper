 When assessing occurrence and exposure to toxic chemicals in drinking water developing methods that are sensitive and efficient is paramount . A new method was developed for the quantification of ten halobenzoquinones a class of disinfection by products in drinking water which have been shown to be more toxic than most regulated DBPs . This method uses a small sample volume with online solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . Previous methods used offline SPE coupled with standard addition and a pre concentration step . This requires larger volumes of sample solvent and standards . The current method has comparable limits of quantification requires minimal sample preparation and analysis is almost entirely automated . It also includes 2 6 dibromo 3chloro 5 methyl 1 4 benzoquinone which was not included in previous methods . A stability test was conducted over a one week period with different preservatives including ascorbic acid sodium thiosulfate and formic acid . Method optimization included source temperature SPE size sample volume and SPE loading time . This method was validated using drinking water collected from four different drinking water plants spike recoveries of HBQs were between 70111 relative standard deviations of 20 and linearity of 0.98 . Further using this method we report the highest concentration of 2 6 dibromo 1 4 benzoquinone found in drinking water .

@highlight A novel method analyzing ten halobenzoquinones was developed.
@highlight Automation resulted in increased efficiency for high throughput analysis.
@highlight Quality control measures resulted in limits of quantification that are highly reproducible.
@highlight Higher bromide to HOCl ratios increased formation of brominated halobenzoquinones.
@highlight Highest concentration of 2 6 dibromo 1 4 benzoquinone reported in drinking water.
