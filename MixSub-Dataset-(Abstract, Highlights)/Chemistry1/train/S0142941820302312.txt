 This study focused on the structural optical and electrical features of chitosan organic layer obtained by spin coating technique both on glass and n Si substrates . XRD results indicated that chitosan has polycrystalline orthorhombic nature . While optical transmittance spectrum of the chitosan organic layer exhibited an increasing tendency in the visible range band gap energy value was calculated as 4.23eV for chitosan by UVVis spectrometer . Electrical performance of organic chitosan layer in a Schottky device was studied by fabricating of Au n Si and Au chitosan n Si devices . The suitability of Au chitosan n Si sandwich devices in optoelectronic applications were tested under dark and illumination conditions . The Au chitosan n Si sandwich device exhibits good photodiode characteristics . Furthermore the effect of X ray radiation doses on the electrical properties of the Au chitosan n Si sandwich device was also investigated . In order to get information about electrical characteristics as a function of X ray radiation doses Au chitosan n Si sandwich device was exposed to X ray radiation in same exposure time and various doses . The results highlighted that the performance of the device with chitosan organic interface layer deteriorated with increasing radiation dose . In addition the transportation mechanism of chitosan based Schottky device was discussed in details .
