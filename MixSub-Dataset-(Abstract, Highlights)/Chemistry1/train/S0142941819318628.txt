 In this study the stick slip mechanism of ABS resin friction noise and the effect of different lubricants on the friction noise were investigated by means of friction coefficient test instrument and self designed noise test method . It was found that different types of lubricants have different effects on ameliorating the noise and stick slip phenomena of ABS material . As the content of lubricant increased the friction noise and stick slip phenomenon of ABS were reduced . According to the study reducing the dynamic and static friction F was the key factor to reduce the stick slip phenomenon and reduce the friction noise .

@highlight The stick slip mechanism of friction noise was evaluated by friction coefficient tester and self designed noise test method.
@highlight The effect of lubricants on the friction noise was also evaluated by friction coefficient tester and self designed method.
@highlight Different types of lubricants had various effects on ameliorating the noise and stick slip phenomena of ABS material.
@highlight As the content of lubricant increased the friction noise and stick slip phenomenon of ABS were reduced.
@highlight Reducing the dynamic and static friction F was the key factor to eliminate the stick slip phenomenon and the friction noise.
