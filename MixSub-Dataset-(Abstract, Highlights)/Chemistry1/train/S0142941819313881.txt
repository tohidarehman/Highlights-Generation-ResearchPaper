 Incorporating two dimensional boron nitride into polyimide aluminum nitride renders a simple strategy in producing new ternary composite films with longer corona aging life and higher breakdown strength compared with PI AlN . During corona aging process the effects of 2 D BN on adjusting the microstructure evolution of ternary composites were investigated using quasi in situ technology systematically as follow and at different corona time . Quasi in situ characterization results show that the corona aging modes of the two composite films are quite different the introduction of BN nanosheets could protect the CNC and COC bonds from breaking as well as accelerate the fillers expose via autoxidation reaction . In addition BN nanosheets could induce the distance between PI molecular chains to shorten during the corona process resulting in more dense structures coordinating with AlN and PI . Different corona aging mechanism compared with that of the PI AlN composite films was proposed . This work demonstrated the effect of 2 D BN nanosheets in the PI AlN BN ternary composites which can be used to expand their application in insulating polymer based composites .
