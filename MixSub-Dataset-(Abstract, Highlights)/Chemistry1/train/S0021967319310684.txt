 A novel combined vortex assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction micro solid phase extraction procedure for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient fine particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter of 2.5m PM

@highlight A combined microextraction procedure VA DLLME SPE was developed.
@highlight PAHs associated with ambient air particulate matter PM
@highlight were determined.
@highlight The PAH levels were determined using GC MS MS.
@highlight The method showed good extraction efficiency.
