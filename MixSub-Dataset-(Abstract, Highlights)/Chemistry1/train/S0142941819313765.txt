 In this study we developed a new organic inorganic pigment by precipitation of dye molecules onto aluminum magnesium hydroxide . The morphology and physico chemical properties of the pigment were characterized by X ray diffraction analysis secondary ion mass spectrometry 27 Al solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis . The incorporation of the azo dye into the LH host caused an increase in the interlayer distances of the LP from 0.751 to 0.758nm . The LP pigment also showed better thermal and photo stability than the pristine azo chromophore . The novel organic inorganic additive was next applied as a filler at different concentrations to obtain colorful ethylene norbornene films . The morphological mechanical and flame retardant properties of the composites were determined by XRD SEM dynamic mechanical analysis and cone calorimetry tests . The EN films containing the LH Azo dye demonstrated improved mechanical barrier and flame retardant properties . Compared to the neat EN copolymer and EN LH composite the EN LP sample was found to be the most resistant to UV aging as confirmed by FTIR and mechanical analysis .

@highlight Organic inorganic pigment based on azo dye and inorganic host was obtained.
@highlight Prepared pigment exhibited enhanced thermal stability and solvent resistance.
