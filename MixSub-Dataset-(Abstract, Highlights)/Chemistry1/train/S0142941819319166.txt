 Silica is used as a reinforcing filler in the rubber product such as a tire . When silica contents increased in the composite deterioration of the processability and silica dispersion in silica rubber composites can not be overcome only by adding a silane coupling agent . Therefore silica wet masterbatch technology is considered for manufacturing highly silica filled composites . Herein we investigated silica dispersion cure behavior mechanical properties abrasion characteristics and viscoelastic properties of 3 types of WMB blend composites . Up to 82 improvement in silica dispersion was determined by the Payne effect and confirmed by atomic force microscopy . The tensile strength and elongation at break increased and tan at 60C decreased by improving silica dispersion . The silica WMB is suitable for manufacturing highly silica filled composites .

@highlight Payne effect analysis revealed 82 improved silica dispersion in T 2 WMB blend compound.
@highlight Three type WMB applied blend compounds exhibited relaxed filler flocculation and low compound Mooney viscosity.
@highlight Three type WMB applied blend compounds showed good elongation tensile strength and abrasion properties.
@highlight Excellent fuel efficiency of ESBR BR NR WMB blend compounds was confirmed by good silica dispersion.
@highlight Silica WMB is suitable for manufacturing highly silica filled compounds.
