 The critical temperatures pressures heat capacities and thermal diffusivities of valerolactone and methyl ethyl butyl and pentyl pentanoates have been measured . Heat capacities and thermal diffusivities have been measured at atmospheric pressure in the temperature ranges from 298.15K to 473.15K and from 303.15K to 383.15K respectively . Experimental critical constants have been compared with those calculated using the group contribution methods of Wilson and Jasperson Jobak Constantinou and Gani Marrero and Gani and Hukkerikar et al . The thermal conductivities of the compounds under study have been calculated using experimental data . The temperature dependencies of heat capacities thermal diffusivities and thermal conductivities have been approximated by third order and first order polynomials . The coefficients of these polynomials have been given . Experimental heat capacities have been compared with those estimated by the methods of Kolska et al .
