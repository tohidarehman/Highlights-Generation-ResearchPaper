 Recycling counter current chromatography has been developed and widely used in preparative separation . Due to increasingly broader peaks with longer elution times recycling elution must be stopped before a peak overlap occurs resulting in the insufficient separation of target compounds . In this study the concept of

@highlight The
@highlight concentration technique compressed effluent with separation effect.
@highlight Unlimited recycling CCC was achieved by
@highlight concentration and recycling elution.
@highlight URCCC strategy could increase recycling times until satisfied separation achieved.
@highlight Naphthaquinones were isolated by URCCC with excellent resolution and yield 89.6 .
@highlight The new strategy greatly expanded the application of CCC in preparative separation.
