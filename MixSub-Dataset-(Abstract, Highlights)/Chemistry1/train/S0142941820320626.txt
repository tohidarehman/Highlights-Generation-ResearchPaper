 Dynamic fracture in single edge notched polymethyl methacrylate beams have been investigated by three point bending impact testing with a drop weight machine . A high speed camera combined with the digital image correlation method is used to capture the impact induced crack initiation and propagation as well as the beam deformation fields and the open mode strain at the original notch tip . The crack propagation length is recorded and the instantaneous crack velocity is calculated . Furthermore the dynamic fracture toughness

@highlight Dynamic fracture in single edge notched PMMA beams have been investigated by three point bending impact testing.
@highlight The impact testing is associated with a high speed camera combining digital image correlation DIC method.
@highlight The dynamic fracture toughness
@highlight shows a linear increase to the impact velocity.
@highlight The fracture initiation strain values are consistent but the strain rate increases to higher impact velocity energy.
@highlight The peak crack propagation velocity is higher for impact at higher energy.
