 There has been an increased interest on the development of infrared radiation regulation based on microstructured surfaces with desired radiative properties . Here design of a microstructured surface is proposed in terms of structural combinations to mediate the IR characteristics of targets . The designed microstructured surface is a combined structure which is a two dimension periodic composite grating obtained by combining two periodic simple gratings with different parameters and taking the union . Remarkably the simple grating is also a combined structure obtained by combining and taking the intersection of two different single structures a dielectric metal dielectric structure and a metal grating structure . The results show that on the premise of having the structural characteristics of both constituent structures the designed combined structures can not only inherit the spectral characteristics of both constituent structures but also have some new effects . For the adjusted composite grating it is found that three absorption peaks with the maximal absorbance up to 89 are achieved in 58m range . Additionally the average reflectance is greater than 80 in 35m and 814m bands . The adjusted composite grating fulfills the requirement for multiband regulation and the method of structural combinations suggests a feasible means to regulate the IR characteristics of targets .
