 A novel and simple derivatization method using a series of amide acetals as derivatization reagents along with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis were developed and validated for simultaneous determination of 9 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids in this study . The structures and fragmentation pathway of PFCAs derivatives were deduced and verified . The derivatization method developed in this study improved the sensitivity of the detection of PFCAs by GC . The applicability of 6 amide acetals for the derivatization of PFCAs was demonstrated . Derivatization conditions for 9 PFCAs were optimized with addition of 20 L of derivatization reagent and reaction at 35 C for 30min . 9 PFCAs derivatives were confirmed to be stable over 15 days . The instrument detection limits were lower than 0.01 pg L. The intra and inter day precisions were below 4.06 and 5.48 respectively . To demonstrate the utility of the derivatization method the level of PFCAs in the marine products were detected . The alkaline digestion followed by solid phase extraction cleanup method was used for pretreatment . The method detection limits ranged from 0.04 to 0.10ng g and the spiked recoveries ranged between 54.72 and 107.29 with relative standard deviation of 1.53 11.89 . Five PFCAs were detected in the range of 0.66 to 499.03ng g dry weight .
