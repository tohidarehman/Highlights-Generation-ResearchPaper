 The traditional processing technology of shape memory polymer composites is complex and the cost of high performance filler is high . Therefore low cost high density polyethylene was introduced into

@highlight The TPI HDPE hybrid shape memory polymer composites and its preparation method were presented in this paper.
@highlight The crystallization properties mechanical and shape memory properties of TPI HDPE SMPCs were comprehensively analyzed.
@highlight The results show the TPI HDPE SMPCs with the blend ratio of 80 20 has excellent thermodynamic and shape memory properties.
