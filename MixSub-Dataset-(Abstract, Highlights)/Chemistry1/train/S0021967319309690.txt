 Improvements in sample preparation separation and mass spectrometry continue to expand the coverage in LC MS based lipidomics . While longer columns packed with smaller particles in theory give higher separation performance compared to shorter columns the implementation of this technology above commercial limits has been sparse due to difficulties in packing long columns and successfully operating instruments at ultrahigh pressures . In this work a liquid chromatograph that operates up to 35kpsi was investigated for the separation and identification of lipid species from human plasma . Capillary columns between 1550cm long were packed with 1.7m BEH C18 particles and evaluated for their ability to separate lipid isomers and complex lipid extracts from human plasma . Putative lipid class identifications were assigned using accurate mass and relative retention time data of the eluting peaks . Our findings indicate that longer columns packed and operated at 35kpsi outperform shorter columns packed and run at lower pressures in terms of peak capacity and numbers of features identified . Packing columns with relatively high concentration slurries while sonicating the column resulted in 634 increase in peak capacity for 50cm columns compared to lower slurry concentrations and no sonication . For a given analysis time 50cm long columns operated at 35kpsi provided a 2095 increase in chromatographic peak capacity compared with 15cm columns operated at 15kpsi . Analysis times up to 4h were evaluated generating peak capacities up to 4105
