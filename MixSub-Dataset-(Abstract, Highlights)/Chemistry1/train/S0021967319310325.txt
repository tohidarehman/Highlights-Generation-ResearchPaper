 Jumonji domain containing proteins play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression . Aberrant regulation of histone modification has been observed in the progression of a variety of diseases such as neurological disorders and cancer . Therefore discovery of selective modulators of JMJDs is very attractive in new drug discovery . Herein a simple capillary electrophoresis method was developed for screening of inhibitors against JMJD3 . A known JMJD3 inhibitor GSK J1 5 carboxyfluorescein labeled substrate peptide with an amino acid sequence of KAPRKQLATKAARKSAPATGG as well as a small chemical library composed of 37 purified natural compounds and 30 natural extracts were used for method development and validation . The separation of substrate from its demethylated product was achieved by addition of polycation hexadimethrine bromide in the running buffer . The enzyme activity was thus assayed accurately through separating the demethylated product from the substrate and then measuring the peak area of the product . The enzyme inhibition can be read out by comparing the peak area of the demethylated product obtained in the present of inhibitors and that of the negative control in the absence of any inhibitor . The merit of the method is proved by discovering two new JMJD3 inhibitors salvianic acid A and puerarin 6 O xyloside .

@highlight We developed a CE method for screening of histone demethylase JMJD3 inhibitors.
@highlight The method is straightforward and robustness.
@highlight Coating the capillary with a positively charged polyelectrolyte is necessary for the method.
@highlight Salvianic acid a and puerarin 6 O xyloside were identified as new JMJD3 inhibitors.
