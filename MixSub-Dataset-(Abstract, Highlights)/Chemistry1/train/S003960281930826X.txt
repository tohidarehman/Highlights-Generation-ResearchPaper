 Studying the In and Bi coadsorption onto the Si surface at elevated temperatures using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Angle Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory we have found the formation of a 24 array of In Bi heterogeneous dimers . The surface is closely related to a Bi induced Si2

@highlight In and Bi atoms form heterogenous In Bi dimers on the Si 100 .
@highlight In Bi heterodimers are arranged into 24 lattice with three dimers per unit cell.
@highlight Inside the unit cell an asymmetric In Bi dimer may have two orientations the orientation of a dimer has no obvious correlation to the neighboring one.
@highlight The surface reconstruction displays semiconducting properties with small Rashba type spin splitting of surface states.
