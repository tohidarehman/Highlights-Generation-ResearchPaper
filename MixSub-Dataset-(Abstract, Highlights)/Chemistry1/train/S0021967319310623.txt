 Sample preparation of complex matrices like food samples continues to be a challenge demanding great effort for improvements . In this study a new technique named balls in tube matrix solid phase dispersion is proposed based on a simplification of the conventional MSPD technique being all sample preparation performed directly in a closed extraction tube with the assistance of steel balls . An innovative method using BiT MSPD was successfully established for the determination of 133 pesticide residues in apple peach pear and plum by ultra high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry . Several sorbents were evaluated as solid support in different proportions with the sample . The homogenization step using mortar glass rod or steel balls with methanol and acetonitrile as extraction solvent was evaluated . Vortex and ultrasound assisted extractions were also tested . Best results were obtained with C18 homogenization with steel balls acetonitrile as solvent and ultrasound assisted extraction . Validation presented adequate trueness and precision results for the evaluated pesticides with recovery results ranging from 72 to 113 and RSD17 . Practical limit of detection and quantification for the compounds were 3 and 10gkg

@highlight A novel BiT MSPD technique was developed for first time for pesticides extraction from fruits.
@highlight BiT MSPD is fast easy to perform and tools are cheap and very accessible.
@highlight The use of balls improved the method efficience when compared to official methods.
@highlight Practical method limit of quantification for 133 pesticide residues was 10gkg
