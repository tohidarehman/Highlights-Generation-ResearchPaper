 The initial adsorption of Ag atoms on Si 21 was investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy . The Ag atoms initially adsorb on a special site keeping its periodicity . Preferentially they adsorb on the site between the tetramer in D1 section and chain . With additional Ag the Ag induced protrusion appears to have a 3periodicity different from the 2periodicity of the substrate along

@highlight The initial adsorption of Ag atoms on high index Si 5 5 12 was investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy.
@highlight The Ag atoms preferentially adsorb on the site between the tetramer in D1 section and p chain.
