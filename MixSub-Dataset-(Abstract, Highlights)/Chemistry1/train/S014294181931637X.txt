 Developing conductive networks in a polymer matrix with a low percolation threshold and excellent mechanical properties is desired for soft electronics applications . In this work natural rubber functionalized with poly was prepared for strong interfacial interactions with multiwalled carbon nanotubes resulting in excellent performance of the natural rubber nanocomposites . The MWCNT and methyl methacrylate functional groups gave good filler dispersion conductivity and tensile properties . The filler network in the matrix was studied with microscopy and from its non linear viscoelasticity . The Maier Gritze approach revealed that MWCNT network formation was favored in the NR functionalized with PMMA with reduced electrical and mechanical percolation thresholds . The obvious improvement in physical performance of MWCNT methyl methacrylate functionalized natural rubber nanocomposites was caused by interfacial interactions and reduced filler agglomeration in the NR matrix . The modification of NR with poly and MWCNT filler was demonstrated as an effective pathway to enhance the mechanical and electrical properties of natural rubber nanocomposites .
