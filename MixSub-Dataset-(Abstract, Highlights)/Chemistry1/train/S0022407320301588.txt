 In the present work we carried out a combined rotational and ro vibrational investigation on 1 1 2 trifluoroethene a relevant unsaturated hydrofluoroolefin recently proposed as refrigerant in mixture with other halogenated compounds . By employing a frequency modulation millimeter wave spectrometer the rotational spectra were recorded in the frequency ranges 8096GHz and 245260GHz for the ground and also the vibrationally excited states
