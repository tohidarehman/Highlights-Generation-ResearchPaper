 In the present work a detailed thermochemical experimental and theoretical study of benzocaine is presented . The enthalpy of formation in crystalline state at

@highlight Combustion experiments were carry out on benzocaine.
@highlight Thermochemical properties were determined experimentally and theoretically.
@highlight Entropy of benzocaine was computed from computational methods.
@highlight Gibbs energy of benzocaine in gas and solid states were derived.
