 The effect of halloysite nanotube particles and polyolefin elastomer graft maleic anhydride in the polylactic acid and polyolefin elastomer blend with a constant weight percentage composition have been studied using the scanning electron microscopy rheometry dynamic mechanical thermal analysis as well as the thermogravimetric testing . Through these it was found that the simultaneous presence of POE g MA and HNT significantly improves the melt and solid viscoelastic properties and thermal stability of PLA POE . This improvement is attributed to the increased interactions and improved interfacial adhesion between the present components . The microscopic images of PLA POE g MA POE blend containing 4wt HNT showed a microstructure similar to the interconnected morphology due to the enhanced compatibility and better dispersion of nanoparticles . The rheological behavior was significantly changed for the PLA POE blend containing POE g MA and 4wt HNT . This dramatic increase in the rheological properties was consistent with the morphological results . Only one glass transition temperature was observed in the DMTA plot of PLA POE g MA POE blend which was a sign of a homogeneous fully compatible system . In addition a very strong reinforcing effect of HNT particles was observed in the presence of POE g MA for the nanocomposites . Finally the thermogravimetric analysis showed a completely different trend for thermal degradation of PLA POE g MA POE nanocomposite containing 4wt HNT which could be an indication of microstructural development .
