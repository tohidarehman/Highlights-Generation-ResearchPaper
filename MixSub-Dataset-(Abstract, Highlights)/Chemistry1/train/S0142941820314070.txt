 Three dimensional printing is a frontier manufacturing approach with great potential to benefit biomedical and patient care sectors . In the last decades different types of biomedical materials were investigated in purpose of developing medical tools and devices . The present study attempts to assess mechanical performances of the newly developed chitosan reinforced poly lactic acid scaffolds by using fused filament fabrication based 3D printing technology . Specifically the effects of chitosan loading infill density and annealing temperature on mechanical behavior of PLA composite scaffolds are investigated via design of experiments . Moreover fracture behavior under various load types is studied with the help of selective electron microscopy . It is found that the strength of the produced composite samples depends significantly on the loading of chitosan and infill density while annealing temperature does not affect mechanical response . Overall the developed PLA composite scaffolds are mechanically efficient and they appear suitable for clinical purposes .

@highlight Novel chitosan reinforced PLA scaffold was obtained using fused filamet fabrication.
@highlight Discontinuities in polymeric chain have been indtroduced after the incorporation of chitosan particles.
@highlight Resulted scaffolds possesed higher mechanical properties ad therefore are suitable for dynamic motions.
