 Hopkinson non penetrating low speed impact test was carried out on Kevlar flexible fabrics . The impact basin was formed by the clay on the back of the fabric and the ultimate deformation of the fabric was recorded completely . The 3D shape of the clay impact basin was measured by fringe projection profilometry and converted into the impact basin volume . At the same time the relationship between the indentation volume and the deformation energy of the clay was calibrated using the clay intrusion test . The clay impact basin volume is then converted into the residual energy of the flexible fabric subjected to the low speed impact and a new index of the impact basin volume is established to evaluate the energy absorption efficiency of fabric under the low speed impact . Finally combined with the deformation of single layer fabric the stress wave propagation in the impact deformation process of fabric is discussed which is helpful to understand the impact energy absorption mechanism of flexible fabric .

@highlight Low speed impact test on Kevlar 49 plain fabric was conducted and the fabric ultimate deformation was recorded with clay.
