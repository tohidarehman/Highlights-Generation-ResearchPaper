 Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene is reinforced with 13wt sliver nanoparticles and zinc oxide micro rods and tensile strength as well as wear resistance of the samples is evaluated . Tensile strength was observed to increase with Ag and ZnO reinforcement up to 18 for 1wt ZnO and 1wt Ag but in case of 3wt ZnO and 3wt Ag 3wt ZnO it decreases marginally by 4 when compared with neat polymer . The sliding wear rate for 1wt Ag 1wt ZnO and 3wt Ag 3wt ZnO decreases from 9.5410

@highlight Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene UHMWPE is reinforced with Ag and ZnO.
@highlight Damage assessment at different length scales microscratching sliding wear .
@highlight Microscratching is resisted more by harder ZnO reinforcement.
@highlight Sliding wear is resisted more with formation of Ag tribolayer.
@highlight An optimal combination of UHMWPE 1 wt. Ag 1wt. ZnO as potential acetabular cup liner material.
