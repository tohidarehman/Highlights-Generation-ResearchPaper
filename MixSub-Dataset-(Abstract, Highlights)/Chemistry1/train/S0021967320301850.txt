 It is critical to determine the chiral impurity profile of pharmaceutical compounds . The rising trend of drug candidates bearing multiple chiral centers has aggravated the analytical challenges . The traditional chiral HPLC methods can take gruelingly long time to develop yet may not offer sufficient resolution for all stereoisomers . A fast analytical strategy with a high success rate is in urgent demand for compounds with multiple chiral centers . In this study we have developed an effective and fast multiple heart cutting multicolumn two dimensional liquid chromatography LC

@highlight A multiple heart cutting multiple columns 
@highlight  LC
@highlight LC strategy was developed
