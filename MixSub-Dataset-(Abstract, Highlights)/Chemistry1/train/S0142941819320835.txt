 For the first time the physical effects of long term environmental conditions on through thickness interphase in polymer matrix composites were studied . Atomic force microscopy based Peak Force Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping technique was utilized to study the effects of heat and humidity on the mechanical properties of interphase at nanometer resolution . Samples were aged with a heat of 60C and relative humidity of 90 for up to 2 years . The width of the interphase is uneven and river like through the thickness in unaged and aged composites . The width of interphase depends on its location and the degree of moisture saturation . The difference in thickness of the interphase through the thickness reduces with exposure time . While the mechanism of expansion and shrinkage of interphase is different through thickness the range of material modulus is almost the same through thickness in unaged and aged conditions . Rate of debonding increases from unaged to one year aged and reduces in the second year of exposure .
