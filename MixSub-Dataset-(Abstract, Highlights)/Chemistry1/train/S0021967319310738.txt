 Most of the reported covalent organic frameworks are hydrophobic limiting their adsorption application in sample pretreatment field . In this work sulphonate functionalized magnetic covalent organic frameworks composites were first synthesized by loading gold nanoparticles on Fe

@highlight Functionalized magnetic covalent organic framework composite was facilely prepared.
@highlight Magnetic composites were employed for highly effective fluoroquinolones enrichment.
@highlight MSPE HPLCMS MS method was developed for fluoroquinolones detection in food samples.
