 A mixture system of small molecular organics polymer is widely applied in various industries . A relatively accurate determination of their miscibility is crucial for well understanding and predicting their phase behaviors and material properties . However miscibility results from different literature could vary much . This study systematically compares various approaches to determine the mixture miscibility e.g . the interaction parameter

@highlight Various approaches to determine miscibility are systematically compared.
@highlight Four small organics and an amorphous polymer are employed.
@highlight Dynamics of phase separation is minimized by using a polymer with low
@highlight Advantages disadvantages and suitability of each approach are presented.
@highlight A guide to selecting a suitable determination of miscibility is provided.
