 This work presents a new triptycene based stationary phase combining the three dimensional triptycene framework with polyethylene glycol moieties for gas chromatographic separations . Its statically coated capillary column showed high column efficiency of 5263 plates m determined by naphthalene at 120C . Its Rohrschneider McReynolds constants and Abraham solvation system constants were measured to characterize its polarity and molecular interactions with analytes of different types . As evidenced the TP PEG column showed high resolution performance for the isomers of anilines phenols halobenzenes and alkanes with distinct advantages over the PEG columns particularly those critical isomers such as 3 5 2 3 xylidine

@highlight Combining the 3D rich TP framework with polar PEG moieties.
@highlight High resolution performance for the isomers of anilines phenols and alkanes.
