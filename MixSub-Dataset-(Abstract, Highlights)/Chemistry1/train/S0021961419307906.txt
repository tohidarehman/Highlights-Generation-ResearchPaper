 The solubility profile of apixaban in pure and mixed solvents within the temperature range from K under atmosphere pressure was studied and evaluated by some thermodynamics models . The solid state of apixaban in equilibrated form was characterized using powder X ray diffraction technique . The maximum mole solubility in pure solvents was obtained in 1 4 dioxane 3.64810
