 In the study walnut shells and silanized walnut shells were used as cellulosic fillers for novel polyurethane composite foams . The impact of 1 2 and 5

@highlight Walnut shells WS and silanized walnut shells S WS have influence on foaming process of PU system.
@highlight Morphology of PU foams is significantly affected by the fillers content.
@highlight PU foams modified with S WS are characterized by better mechanical and thermal properties.
@highlight The use of WS and S WS as natural fillers in PU composite foams can promote a new application path.
