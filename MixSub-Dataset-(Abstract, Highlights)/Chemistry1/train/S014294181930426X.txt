 The low velocity impact behavior of basalt epoxy composites seen as an eco friendly replacement of glass epoxy composites has not been studied systematically so far . Here the elastic elasto plastic properties strengths intralaminar and interlaminar fracture energies were determined . The intralaminar energies were determined using compact tension and compression tests . The elasto plastic properties needed in the plastic potential were determined using off axis test . These properties are used in Finite Element code with an elasto plastic damage model developed earlier to simulate the impact response of cross ply laminates basalt epoxy laminates . Low velocity impact experiments at 10J 20J and 30J are performed on these composites . The FE simulation is successful in capturing force energy deflection histories and damage zones showing a close match to the experiments . A comparison of impact force history and damage area of basalt epoxy laminates with glass epoxy laminates having same volume fraction shows nearly similar peak forces but the major axis of the ellipsoidal damage zone was bigger in glass epoxy laminates .
