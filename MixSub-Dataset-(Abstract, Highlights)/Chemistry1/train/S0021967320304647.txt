 Selectivity and high throughput are important for determination of trace level of various organophosphate flame retardants in environmental matrices . In this work three selective monolithic fibers for solid phase microextraction were prepared and evaluated . They are graphene oxide based surface trimethyl phosphate imprinted polymeric fiber GO based surface tri phosphate imprinted polymeric fiber and GO based surface triphenyl phosphate imprinted polymeric fiber . The imprinting factors of GO TMP IPF for TMP GO TECP IPF for TCEP and GO TPhP IPF for TPhP were tested as high as 4.3 4.5 10.3 respectively . The three fibers were bound to a stainless steel wire to assemble a GO based surface molecularly imprinted polymeric fiber array . GO MIP FA SPME device was coupled to gas chromatography flame photometric detector and carried out simultaneous determination of TMP TCEP and TPhP in environmental water . Under the optimal conditions ultralow limits of quantification 1.7 ng L
