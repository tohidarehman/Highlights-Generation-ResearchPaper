 The simultaneous use of nitrite and sorbate as preservatives in meat products may produce mutagenic compounds such as the ethylnitrolic acid and 2 methyl 1 4 dinitro pyrrole . We developed a sensitive analytical method with high metrological reliability . After assessing several extraction approaches and chromatographic separation modes a modified Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe approach was chosen for sample preparation which were analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography with C

@highlight Several sample preparation and chromatographic approaches were assessed.
@highlight A modified QuEChERS and RP C
@highlight  LCESI MS MS approach was fully validated.
@highlight This method can quantitate ENA and DNMP traces in various processed meats.
@highlight Positive results for ENA and DNMP carcinogens in meats were obtained.
