 The ultra trace determination of nicotine and its 4 major metabolites from rabbit plasma was achieved by a newly developed solid phase microextractionliquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry method . Extraction of the target analytes was performed with hydrophilic lipophilic balance polyacrylonitrile SPME fibers . Dual fiber extraction was necessary to guarantee improved recovery at parts per trillion levels . Liquid chromatographic analysis was achieved in a 6 min run using a C18 column with a mobile phase flow rate of 0.4mL min . Tandem mass spectrometry was used for detection and quantification in positive electrospray ionization mode for all the targeted analytes . Two stable isotope labeled internal standards were used for signal correction and accurate quantification . The mass spectrometer with laminar flow ion flux transport guaranteed improved signal stability minimal contamination of the ion guide and reproducibility into the first quadrupole analyzer . The method was validated in line with the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for bioanalytical method validation . The results met the acceptance criteria as proposed by the FDA accuracy was tested at 0.35 10 and 75g
