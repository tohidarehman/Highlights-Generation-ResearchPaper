 In this paper steady state luminescence spectroscopy is used for the analysis of curing of epoxy resin . The advantage of this method is its rapidity simplicity and sensitivity . Moreover this method is contactless and thus non invasive . The aim is to analyze epoxy resin mathematically describe its curing kinetics and determine its storage temperature . Using the photoluminescence method a rapid procedure for obtaining the necessary technological data is achieved . This method is suitable for continuous measurement in production because there is no contact with the material and the measurement itself can be performed very quickly . The elaborated mathematical model can serve as a basis for creating algorithms for automated data processing in case of fully robotic workplaces .
