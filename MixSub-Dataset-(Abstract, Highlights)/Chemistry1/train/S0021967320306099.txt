 In this work a novel imidazolium bonding method was proposed for the synthesis of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography stationary phases . One obtained stationary phase was derived from direct reaction between

@highlight A novel imidazolium bonding method were proposed for synthesis of HILIC column.
@highlight Introduction of imidazolium ILs improved separation efficiency.
@highlight Paired anions in ILs are proved to affect chromatographic performance.
@highlight The stationary phases displayed classic HILIC characteristics.
@highlight Electrostatic and polarity interaction mechanism ensure the effective separation.
