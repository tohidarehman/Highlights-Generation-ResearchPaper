 Fast active sampling of volatile organic compounds under field conditions still is a great challenge especially when the exposure time to the source of emissions is a restricting factor . Hence to identify ideal conditions for such applications we systematically compared

@highlight With
@highlight VOCs are better recovered with XAD 2 than with Tenax TA.
@highlight The recovery of VOCs decreases with high sample flow rates.
@highlight In general XAD 2 is the better option for sampling of VVOCs than Tenax TA.
