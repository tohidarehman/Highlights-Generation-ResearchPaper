 A Poly UiO 66 composite was electrodeposited on an etched stainless steel wire as head space solid phase microextraction coating . A robust well controlled thickness and uniform coating of metal organic framework composites can be realized by the electrodeposited strategy . The incorporated UiO 66 not only enhanced the uniformity and stability of the composite coating but also effectively decreased the stacking phenomenon of PEDOT and improved its extraction efficiency which was over 100 times higher than that of the PEDOT coating without UiO 66 . The composite coating was used to enrich seven types of volatile organic compounds in ion exchange resins including methyl cyclohexane benzene toluene ortho xylene styrene para xylene and divinyl benzene . The results of adsorption isotherm analysis showed that stacking effect played dominant role between the composite coating and VOCs in the extraction process . The composite coating was characterized by scanning electron microscopy X ray diffraction Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis respectively . A determination method for seven kinds of VOCs was established by HS SPME coupled with gas chromatography flame ionization detection . Under the optimal experimental conditions the detection linear range was 0.09 100 ng mL
