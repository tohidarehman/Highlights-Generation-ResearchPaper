 Perfluorinated compounds are new types of persistent organic pollutants known to bioaccumulate in organism which have come under increased scrutiny due to the close relation with various health problems . Sensitive detection of PFCs remains a significant challenge because of their ultratrace levels in complex samples . Herein fluorinated magnetic covalent organic frameworks Fe

@highlight Fluorinated magnetic COFs were synthesized via in situ growth strategy.
@highlight The magnetic COFs exhibited high adsorption performance towards six PFCs.
@highlight The FM SPE HPLC MS MS method was simple fast highly efficient and selective.
@highlight The developed method can be applied for the detection of ultratrace PFCs in milk.
