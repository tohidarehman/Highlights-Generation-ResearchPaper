 In this study a novel phenylboronic acid polymeric monolith in polyether ether ketone tube was fabricated . The inner wall of PEEK tube was modified with mussel inspired polydopamine layer to firmly bond PBAPM so as to avoid the outflow of PBAPM from PEEK tube and improve the service life and application scope of PBAPM . The PBAPM was synthesized by initiator free ring opening polymerization based on our previous work . The boric acid groups provided BN coordination sites as well as the hydrophobic amino and epoxy monomers provided hydrophobic interaction sites . Due to the synergistic effect of hydrophobic interaction and BN coordination the PBAPM exhibited excellent binding amounts for nitrogen containing sulfonamides . In addition the PBAPM possessed excellent stability rigidity and permeability . Therefore the PBAPM was used as solid phase microextraction material for enrichment and separation of SAs from aqueous samples . The PBAPM SPME was optimized in detail and combined with ultra performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry analysis for simultaneous determination of 10 kinds of SAs from tap lake and river water . Using only 1mL of water samples limit of quantitation of SAs could reach 0.544.5ngL
