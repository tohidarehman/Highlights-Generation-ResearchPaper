 The composite laminates are susceptible to delamination between reinforcing plies during their long term service . In this paper we propose a modified carbon fiber epoxy composite laminate with embedded clustered dual component microcapsules in order to increase the interlaminar fracture toughness of the lamina . The details of microcapsules were illustrated using scanning electron microscope . The modified CF EP composite laminates were fabricated using hot compaction technique . Mode I interlaminar fracture tests were conducted using double cantilever beam specimens then the values of opening fracture toughness

@highlight A modified composite laminate with embedded clustered microcapsules was prepared.
@highlight The maximum load of the modified DCB composite laminate increased by 59.8 .
@highlight The clustered microcapsules are equal to special Z pinings and thus enhanced local strength.
@highlight The toughening mechanism was revealed and discussed through micrographs of the fracture surfaces.
