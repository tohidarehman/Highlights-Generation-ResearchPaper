 Allylglycine a conventional amino acid derivative possesses typical zwitterionic and hydrophilic functionalities deriving from the carboxyl and amino groups in its structure . A novel monolithic column poly allylglycine

@highlight Glycine modified monoliths with polar amino and carboxyl groups are good for HILIC.
@highlight Allylglycine is firstly used for the preparation of hydrophilic monolithic column.
@highlight The column offers prominent hydrophilic selectivity even at 50 organic phase.
@highlight Highest separation efficiency up to 1.4110
@highlight N m
@highlight for theophylline.
