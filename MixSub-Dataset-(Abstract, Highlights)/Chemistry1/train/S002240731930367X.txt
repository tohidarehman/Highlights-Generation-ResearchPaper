 When the size of scattering particle is increased to be comparable with wavelength Rayleigh approximation becomes not valid . In polarization scattering pattern this quasi rayleigh behavior manifests itself as a sharp drop of the degree of linear polarization to the negative values . In this paper we studied the properties and features of this quasi rayleigh polarization leap for monodisperse spherical scatterers . The main regularities that determine the wavelength position of the quasi rayleigh polarization leap are established depending on the phase angle refractive index and size parameter of the scatterers . A method is suggested for determining the radius of spherical scattering particles of the polystyrene beads in Earth s atmosphere . A simple interpolation formula is given which allows based on observational data such as phase angle and the wavelength at which the quasi rayleigh polarization leap is observed to calculate the particle radius .
