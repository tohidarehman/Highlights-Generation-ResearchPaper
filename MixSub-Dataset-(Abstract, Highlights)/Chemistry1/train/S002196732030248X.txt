 The prominent biological effects of adrenaline noradrenaline and dopamine as well as the clinical importance of their metabolites methoxy4 hydroxyphenyl glycol dihydroxyphenylglycol metanephrine normetanephrine vanillylmandelic acid homovanillic acid have forced researchers to evaluate new analytical methodologies for their isolation and preconcentration from biological samples . For this reason the three most popular extraction techniques solid phase extraction solid phase microextraction were tested . Micellar electrokinetic chromatography a mode of capillary electrophoresis with a diode array detector was applied to assess the extraction efficiency . Next the enrichment factor of each applied method was calculated in respect to standard mixtures of the analytes at the same concentration levels . The EF results of seven selected metabolites of biogenic amines from urine after sample preparation procedures based on twenty five different protocols were calculated and compared using hierarchical cluster analysis . The SPE as well as SPME procedures were proved to be the most effective approaches for the simultaneous extraction of the chosen compounds . Moreover an ionic liquid 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium bisimide added to methanol in SPME additionally could successfully improve the extraction efficiency . It was also confirmed that the HCA approach could be considered a supportive tool in the selection of a suitable sample preparation procedure for that group of endogenous substances .
