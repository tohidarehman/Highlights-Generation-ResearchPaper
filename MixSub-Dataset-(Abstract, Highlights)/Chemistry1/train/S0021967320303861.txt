 In micellar liquid chromatography the addition of a surfactant to the mobile phase in excess is accompanied by an alteration of its solubilising capacity and a change in the stationary phase s properties . As an implication the prediction of the analytes retention in MLC mode becomes a challenging task . Mixed Quantitative Structure Retention Relationships modelling represents a powerful tool for estimating the analytes retention .

@highlight Predictive ability of 48 mixed QSRR models was compared in terms of
@highlight and
@highlight Change in the set of input variables had a minor impact on the models performance.
@highlight Mixed models built by non linear Gradient Boosted Trees showed the highest accuracy.
@highlight Contribution of steric and dipole dipole interactions to MLC retention was stressed.
@highlight Fine tuning of molecular geometry is recommended to increase accuracy of final model.
