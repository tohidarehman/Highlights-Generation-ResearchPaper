 The orientation of the dispersed phase and crystals in the injection molded bar of an impact polypropylene copolymer containing isotactic polypropylene ethylene propylene rubber and a nucleating agent were studied simultaneously . In the IPC iPP and EPR act as the matrix and dispersed phase respectively . The EPR is amorphous and the iPP is crystallizable in and crystalline forms in the presence of the NA . The orientation and orientation distribution for both of the EPR phase and the iPP crystals as well as the crystallization behavior of iPP were investigated by two dimensional wide angle X ray diffraction two dimensional small angle X ray scattering scanning electron microscope and differential scanning calorimetry . The results of the experiment show that orientation exists for both the EPR phase and the iPP crystals . But their orientation distribution manifests an opposite tendency . The EPR phase was observed to be highly oriented in the core layer but the orientation of the iPP crystals was weakened gradually from skin to core . The difference in the orientation behavior between the EPR phase and the iPP crystals reflects the distinct response of the micrometer scale EPR particles and nanometer scale iPP chains upon the flow field and temperature gradient in the mold . The diffraction geometry of the crystals has also been discussed in detail . The observations in this study may shed light on the study in the structure and property relationship for the IPC injection molded products .
