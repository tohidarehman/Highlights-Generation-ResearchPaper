 Modified silica based isoprene rubber composite has been designed and prepared by using a multi functional silane 2 aminoethyl 2 aminoethyl disulfide as coupling agent . Such modification significantly improved the dispersity of silica in the corresponding composites as verified by SEM observation . And the hardness tensile strength stress at definite elongation tear strength and temperature rise as well as the value of dynamic loss coefficient ranging from 0C to 80C of silica IR vulcanized composites are significantly improved especially with low ATD dosage . This modification of silica based IR composite by employing ATD as coupling agent provides a facile and effective method to prepare silica based rubber composites with improved mechanical properties and low hysteresis .
