 By means of laser spectroscopy and optogalvanic detection we searched for unknown spectral lines of atomic lanthanum in the red region of the visible spectrum . Most of the discovered lines could be interpreted as transitions between known energy levels due to wavelength and observed hyperfine structure pattern . For lines which we could not classify we searched for laser induced fluorescence in order to identify at least one level involved in the transition . In this way we discovered 25 energy levels of La I having even parity . For two levels we could improve the accuracy of energy and hyperfine structure constants . These 27 levels classify 213 spectral lines .

@highlight Further investigation of the hyperfine structure constants of La I levels.
