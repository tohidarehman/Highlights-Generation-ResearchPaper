 The potential of alumina has been studied as nanofiller in proton exchange membrane based sodium alginate biopolymer as the matrix phase . The fabricated membrane improved much better than pure sodium alginate membrane in terms of water uptake ion exchange capacity methanol permeability proton conductivity and oxidative stability results . The well connection between matrix and filler leads in excellent performance by the composite which has good new properties . The best membrane performed highest proton conductivity of 25.610

@highlight This study prepared and investigate the performance of new potential membrane based Sodium Alginate Alumina composite.
@highlight The maximum power density of single cell performance achieved by best membrane was 12.13mWcm
@highlight at 30C 
@highlight  .
@highlight This performance of alginate based membrane in DMFC is consider high via passive fuel feeding mood.
