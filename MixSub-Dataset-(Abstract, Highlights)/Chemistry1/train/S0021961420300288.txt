 Nifedipine is an oral calcium channel blocker in clinical practice and widely used to prevent and treat heart diseases . In this work the equilibrium solubility of nifedipine in twelve pure solvents including alcohols and esters was determined by static method at temperatures ranging from 283.15K to 323.15K . In all studied solvent systems the solubility increases monotonously with increasing temperature . Besides the effect of solvent properties on solidliquid phase equilibrium of NIF was investigated . The results show that the solubility of NIF correlates well with the solvent properties in alcohol solvents but no obvious correlation can be found in ester solvents . In addition the solubility data was correlated with the modified Apelblat equation
