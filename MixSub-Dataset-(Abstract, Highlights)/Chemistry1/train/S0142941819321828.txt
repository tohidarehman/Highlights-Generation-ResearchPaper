 In this study the influence of hybridization on the compression response of thermoplastic matrix based composites under high strain rate loading was investigated . The intra ply and inter ply hybrid composites were manufactured with Kevlar Basalt yarns as the reinforcements with Polypropylene as a matrix . Cylindrical composite specimens were laser cut from the flat compression moulded laminates . The composite specimens were loaded under high strain rate using split Hopkinson pressure bar setup at strain rates ranging from 2815 s to 5481 s. The study revealed differences in the rate dependent growth of peak stress peak strain and toughness with the strain rate . Intra ply hybrid composites with alternate weaving of Kevlar and basalt yarns exhibited highest peak stress as compared to the Inter ply hybrid composites and another intra ply composite containing Kevlar in the warp and basalt in the weft direction . Whereas in inter ply hybrid composite with Kevlar as the loading face attained higher stress while composite with Basalt as the loading face attained higher strain . SEM micrographs revealed that Kevlar on the loading face can bear the impact with lesser delamination as compared to the Basalt on the loading face . Damage studies revealed that Kevlar fiber surface loading results in higher stress as compared to basalt surface loading with lower overall damage .
