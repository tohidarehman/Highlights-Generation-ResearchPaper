 High strain rate compression experiments are conducted on woven carbon fabric polyphenylene sulfide composites in the in plane and out of plane directions at different temperatures with a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus . Macro fracture micrographs were used to understand the failure modes . Experimental results indicate that the behavior of CF PPS composites have strong strain rate and temperature dependence . The in plane compressive strength and modulus increase approximately linearly with the strain rate and decrease significantly with increasing temperature . The out of plane compressive modulus exhibits noticeable increase at elevated temperatures due to the viscoelastic characteristics of CF PPS composite whereas the out of plane compressive strength is not sensitive to the temperature . The fracture morphology images reveal that the main failure modes of CF PPS specimens are delamination accompanied shear failure under in plane compression loads and warp fiber bundle breakage under out of plane compression loads .
