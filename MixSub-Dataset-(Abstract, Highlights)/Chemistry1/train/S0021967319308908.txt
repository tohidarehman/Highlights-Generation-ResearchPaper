 A high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry technique hyphenated on line with an immobilized enzyme reactor was developed by the use of 3 known acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . This bioanalytical device allows qualitative comparison of the inhibitory strengths of AChE inhibitors . The AChE inhibitory strengths were evaluated and compared by the corresponding acetylcholine peak areas obtained after a chromatographic separation and the elution through the IMER . Only one injection of the analytes is needed to get this comparative analysis . This bioanalytical device was then applied to the extract of a natural plant

@highlight An innovative HPLC IMER MS bioanalytical device was established for high resolution screening HRS of AChE inhibitor.
@highlight The relative inhibitory strengths of AChE inhibitor could be compared directly by comparing the inhibitor corresponding ACh peak area.
@highlight A new natural AChE inhibitor dihydro latifaliumin C was firstly reported by the application of this HPLC IMER MS bioanalytical device to the
@highlight extract.
