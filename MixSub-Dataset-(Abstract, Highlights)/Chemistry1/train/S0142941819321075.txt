 Although epoxy resins are used in a broad variety of applications due to their good mechanical and thermal properties their low fracture toughness is a limitation exhibiting brittle behavior . This study explored the potential use of imidazolium ionic liquids as toughening agents for epoxy resin based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A with triethylenetetramine as curing agent . Fracture toughness was evaluated for DGEBA TETA epoxy resins with eleven imidazolium IL and the best results were found for the IL with the chloride anion and the shortest

@highlight The highest fracture toughness of DGEBA TETA epoxy resin was achieved with the ionic liquid additive1 
@highlight  butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride.
@highlight No significant losses in other mechanical properties occurred with the addition of a low amount of 1 
@highlight  butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride.
@highlight 1 
@highlight  Butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride reduced the reaction energy for epoxy resin curing and the post curing cross linking density.
@highlight An inverse relationship between cross linking density and fracture toughness was found.
