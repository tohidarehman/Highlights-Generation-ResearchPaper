 We discuss how the efficiency of a chromatography device could be enhanced by incorporating a new feature which ensures flow uniformity . The overall flow of fluid within the device which has a cuboid shape could be visualized as a combination of two z patterns . The device is therefore designated as cuboid z

@highlight Improved cuboid packed bed device for efficient chromatographic separation.
@highlight Novel flow arrangement for scalable uniform flow in chromatography device.
@highlight Arrangement of flow at three levels of hierarchy.
@highlight Superior performance with respect to older version of cuboid packed bed devices.
@highlight Substantially superior performance than equivalent commercial column.
