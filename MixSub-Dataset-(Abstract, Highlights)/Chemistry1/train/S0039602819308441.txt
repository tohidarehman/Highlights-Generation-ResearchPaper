 Scanning tunneling microscopy and non contact atomic force microscopy with a CuO tip is used to investigate adsorption of metal free phthalocyanine H

@highlight Concurrent use of STM and nc AFM with stiff functionalized tip for full interpretation of substrate molecular interactions and adsorption geometry.
@highlight Approach for determining molecular geometries and adsorption sites for conjugated molecules with multiple adsorption modalities.
@highlight CuO tip provides stiff tip for high resolution nc AFM imaging.
