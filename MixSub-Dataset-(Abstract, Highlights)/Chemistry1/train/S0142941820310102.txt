 Sandwich structured composites are in high demand in various industries and additive manufacturing has proven its ability to meet this demand . As a result of the advances in three dimensional printing techniques 3D printed polymers have received considerable attention in fabrication of sandwich structures with complex geometries . This paper is concerned with design manufacturing and analysis of the 3D printed sandwich structured components which experienced various loadings and environmental conditions . The core structure plays a major role in the in plane behavior of lattice composites therefore in this study sandwich specimens with two types of core topologies made of two common and similar 3D printing filaments acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate were manufactured . Based on the applications of sandwich structured parts they might experience different temperatures in their service life . In order to determine effects of thermal environment we conducted accelerated thermal aging within temperatures of 22 60
