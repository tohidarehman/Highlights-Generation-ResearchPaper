 This study presents an innovative approach to the production of reinforced elastomer composites filled with carbon black Printex XE 2B using the calendering process and ionic liquids as dispersing agents . The effect of Printex XE 2B on the mechanical and electrical properties of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber composites was compared to that of conventional carbon black Humex N339 . It was found that the highly structured Printex XE 2B significantly enhanced both the mechanical and electrical properties of the NBR composites in contrast to standard Humex N339 . To obtain uniform filler dispersion in the polymer matrix several different ILs were employed as dispersing agents . The application of ILs had a considerable effect on the properties of the prepared composites due to the improved dispersion of the filler particles in the composite matrix which favored the formation of conductive paths . Importantly the prepared NBR Printex XE 2B IL composites were found to have reversible and repeatable electrical properties following exposure to chloroform vapors .
