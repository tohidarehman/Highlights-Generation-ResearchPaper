 Hydrophilic poly nanocomposite ultrafiltration membranes with excellent antifouling and antibiofouling characteristics are fabricated by employing polyhexanide coated copper oxide nanoparticles . The presence of PCuO NPs is played a significant role in altering the PVDF membrane matrix and probed by XRD FTIR FESEM and contact angle analysis . The PVDF PCuO nanocomposite membranes exhibited an outstanding antifouling performance indicated by the superior pure water flux effective foulant separation and maximum flux recovery ratio during UF experiments as a result of the formation of the hydrophilic and more porous membrane due to the uniform distribution of PCuO NPs . Particularly the PVDF PCuO 3 membrane showed higher PWF of 152.52.4 lm
