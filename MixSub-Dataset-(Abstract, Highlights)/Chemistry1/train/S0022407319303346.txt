 In spite of the enormous progress in electromagnetic scattering since Mie subsequent theories assume that particle optical properties are not perturbed by surface currents . Given that the premise remained largely unexamined major concerns were raised after preliminary results obtained very recently for a charged spherical particle showed that it resonates with the EM radiation in a wide range of modes . The mechanism of this phenomenon is still poorly described for idealized particle models and completely unknown for arbitrarily shaped particle aggregates .

@highlight Excess charge EC initiates unexpectedly amplified optical resonances in nanoparticles.
@highlight EC can have significant consequences for the optical characterization of particle systems.
@highlight Charge controlled resonances can be used in novel optical devices.
@highlight The conductivity models for non spherical particles remain unexplored until now.
