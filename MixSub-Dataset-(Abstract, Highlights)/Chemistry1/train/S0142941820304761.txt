 Novel nanocomposites consisting of conducting poly and graphene nanoplatelets were successfully synthesized by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene using ammonium peroxydisulfate as an oxidizing agent . The formation of PEDOT and its incorporation onto the surface of GNPs were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X ray diffraction . The optical energy band gap
