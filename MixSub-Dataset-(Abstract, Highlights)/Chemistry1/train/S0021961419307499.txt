 Accurate enthalpies of formation of hydrofluoric acid in the gas and liquid states as well as in aqueous solutions are critical for reduction and interpretation of combustion calorimetry data for fluorinated compounds . Analysis of current recommendations reveals inconsistencies with the existing literature that can significantly affect experimental values derived using these recommendations . Through thorough and comprehensive analysis of available experimental data including the sources not considered before we provide recommendations that substantially improve consistency with these results . However the scatter in the existing data also prevents further improvements and uncertainty reduction . New experimental data particularly for aqueous HF solutions are needed to advance .

@highlight Available experimental results for hydrofluoric acid are collected and analyzed.
@highlight New provisional recommendations for HF l HF aq and HF g are provided.
@highlight The updated
@highlight None
@highlight  F
@highlight  aq significantly deviates from the CODATA value.
