 Considerable work has gone into identifying and delineating the effects of quantum monodromy on molecules . Recently this included consideration of transition intensities of the NCNCS molecule using

@highlight HOCl absolute transition intensities calculated with GSRB agree with HITRAN database.
@highlight GSRB spectra obtained using
@highlight dipole moment function in corrected program.
@highlight With one exception the calculated spectra of NCNCS now agree with experiment.
@highlight The calculated and observed
@highlight  type rovibrational transitions of NCNCS do not agree.
@highlight Possible explanations of this disagreement are considered.
