 It is elementary to recognize the benefits and the negative impacts of the use of plastic materials on modern societies . Polyethylene is the major plastic component present in the municipal solid waste . In this paper two types of low density PE waste with different mechanical recycling stress histories were used to investigate the influence of recycling cycles on pyrolysis . The kinetic triplet and thermal degradation study were obtained using TGA data.To determine the sample composition and hydrocarbon arrangements ultimate proximate and X ray diffraction analyses were carried out . Taking advantage of these analyses and combining them with differential scanning calorimetry data a seriesparallel pyrolysis pathway was formulated . The waste of recycled polyethylene presented low enthalpy of pyrolysis at about 205 J g against 299 J g for a virgin PE . The DSC analyses evidenced a multi step reaction behavior of the pyrolysis confirmed by the kinetic study using different isoconversional methods the waste of recycled polyethylene presented a higher variation of activation energies as a function of the fraction reacted . The main conclusion is that the results suggest that the recycling stress history promotes the increase of long carbon chains while weakening the boundary among the compounds . This explains the fact that recycled waste needs less activation energy than other samples to degrade thermally . Finally different categories of low density polyethylene wastes must be considered when dealing with either kinetics or modeling of the product recovery process .

@highlight Recycling stress history on recycled PE increases long carbon chains.
@highlight Thermal and mechanical stress weakens the boundary among PE compounds.
@highlight The recycling stress decreases the pyrolysis enthalpy of the recycled PE.
@highlight Pyrolysis pathway of PE is a competition of phase change and chemical reactions.
