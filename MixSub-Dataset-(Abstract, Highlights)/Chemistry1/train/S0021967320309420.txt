 This work proposes an experimental method for the estimation of the phase ratio of reversed phase C8 columns by employing the equation

@highlight Octane mobile phase as surrogate model for C8 mobile phase chromatography.
@highlight Phase ratio
@highlight calculated from retention factor
@highlight and partition coefficient
@highlight Comparison of
@highlight using octanol water partition coefficient
@highlight and
@highlight Index for suitability of model.
