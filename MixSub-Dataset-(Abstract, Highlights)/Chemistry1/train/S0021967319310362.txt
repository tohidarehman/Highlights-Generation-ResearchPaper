 The purpose of this work was to compare side by side the performance of packed bed and membrane chromatography adsorption processes for protein purification . The comparison was performed using anion exchange media with the same ligand immobilized on the adsorbing surface namely the strong Q quaternary ammonium group R CH

@highlight Direct comparison between membrane and packed bed column.
@highlight Packed bed has higher binding capacity.
@highlight The difference decreases significantly at increased superficial velocity.
@highlight Membrane adsorber capacity is flow rate independent by a variety of measures.
@highlight At low residence times the membrane adsorber outperforms the packed column.
