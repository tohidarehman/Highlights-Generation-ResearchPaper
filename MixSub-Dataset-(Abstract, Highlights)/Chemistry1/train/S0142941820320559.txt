 The present research is mainly based on the fabrication of biodegradable nanofiber mats through the process of electrospinning using a novel combination of Gum Ghatti and Poly vinyl alcohol . The prepared NFM was crosslinked using Glutaraldeyde HCl vapours and was characterized for its tensile strength along other analytical characterizations using FTIR TGA DSC and XRD . The mechanical strength of the NFM was found to be sufficiently high than in comparison to noncrosslinked sample and PVA NFM . The internal architecture of the CL 1 by use of atomic force microscopy revealed that there was very well formed crosslinks suitable for drug loading as well as cell proliferation . The wound healing properties of the CL 1 in mice animal model indicated the healing within 5 days as compared to the control wound . Moreover the sample was also analysed for its ability as polymeric scaffold and no toxicity was found onto the locally applied tissue on histological investigations .

@highlight Preparation of nanofiber mats NFM by electrospining technique using a novel combination of Gum Ghatti with Polyvinyl alcohol and later crosslinking with Glutaraldehyde HCl vapours.
@highlight The Surface morphology and internal architecture of the fibers formed were confirmed by SEM and AFM.
@highlight Analytical characterizations of CL 1 NFM by using FTIR TGA XRD indicated that no incompatibility arose between the two polymer.
@highlight The optical contact angle of the crosslinked NFM CL 1 as well as noncrosslinked NFM NCL 1 showed less contact angle less than 90 thereby making them both appropriate for tissue growth..
@highlight The mechanical strength of CL 1 was much higher than in comparison to NCL 1 and was selected for tissue growth and wound healing studies and wound healing of the CL 1 NFM was faster than the control wound on mice animal model.
