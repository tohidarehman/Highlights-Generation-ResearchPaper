 A series of electro mechanically coupled cyclic tests at large deformation are carried out to characterize the cyclic deformation of a laterally constrained dielectric elastomer in this work . In the strain controlled cyclic tests of the dielectric elastomer with a constant or cyclic voltage cyclic stress softening occurs and is influenced by the phase angle difference between the applied cyclic strain and cyclic voltage . In the stress controlled cyclic tests of VHB 4910 DE with a constant or cyclic voltage ratchetting takes place the ratchetting strain is considerably enhanced by applying higher voltage level higher stress level and lower stress rate and is also affected by the phase angle difference between the applied cyclic stress and cyclic voltage . Moreover the remarkable recovery of residual strain after the cyclic tests demonstrates that the cyclic stress softening and ratchetting of VHB 4910 DE mainly stem from the viscoelasticity . The comprehensive experimental observations are very useful to develop calibrate and validate an electro mechanically coupled constitutive model of dielectric elastomers .
