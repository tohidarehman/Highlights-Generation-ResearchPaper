 Realizing the potential of terpenoid biomarkers as an unequivocal land ecosystem and floral diversity indicator calls for work to establish a direct link between the terpenoids extracted from the plants and those found in the underlying soils . To this end we have characterized the triterpenoid profile of soils and vegetation along two altitudinal transects representing very different ecosystems . The first transect comprising 31 sample sites was on the eastern slopes of Mt Gongga rising from 1230m to 4500m above sea level an area with a temperate monsoonal climate . The second transect sampling 29 sites was on the northern slopes of Mt West Kunlun a region characterized by montane desert meadow and alpine steppe . The dominant terpenoid biomarkers identified in the soils were found to be consistent with the overlying vegetation . However the discovery of some unusual triterpenoids including the pentacyclic triterpene 3 methyl ethers D A friedo 2 3

@highlight 46 terpenoids were isolated from surface soil samples along two transects.
@highlight These biomarkers generally corresponded with the terpenoids in the vegetation present.
@highlight Few terpenoids dominated by taraxerane group were found in alpine meadow soils.
@highlight Some unusual triterpenoids and pentacyclic methyl ethers were identified.
@highlight The soil biomarkers may provide information on previous ecosystems.
