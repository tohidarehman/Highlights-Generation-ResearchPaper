 Wound dressings based on nanofiber polymer scaffolds with good antimicrobial performance and skin reconstruction ability are promising options to thwart wound infection and accelerate wound healing . This paper reports on the synthesis via electrospinning of chitosan alginate nanofiber dressings with various amounts of gentamicin as a drug delivery system . Smooth and continuous nanofibers with no obvious beads were created with increases in the amount of Gn resulting in reduced fiber diameter . Antimicrobial tests showed the Gn loaded nanofibers had good antibacterial performance as indicated by the inhibition of bacterial growth . CS Alg nanofibers loaded with higher Gn concentrations exhibited greater antibacterial performance than those with lower Gn concentrations . In vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that CS Alg wound dressings with 13 Gn improved L929cell attachment and proliferation more than wound dressings with higher Gn concentrations . In vivo experiments revealed that Cs Alg nanofibers loaded with 3 Gn significantly enhanced skin regeneration in a Balb C mice model by stimulating the formation of a thicker dermis increasing collagen deposition and increasing the formation of new blood vessels and hair follicles . Collectively Gn loaded CS Alg wound dressings can be considered a good candidate for drug delivery systems and skin regeneration applications .
