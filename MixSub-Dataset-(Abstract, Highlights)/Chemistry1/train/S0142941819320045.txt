 In additive manufacturing polymer composites are used for setting tailored properties . Short glass fibers can be used as fillers for polyamide 12 for enhancing stiffness or tensile strength as well as for reducing shrinkage . In this paper the effects of short glass fibers on polyamide 12 concerning powder properties process behavior and part properties in laser beam melting of polymers are investigated . It could be shown that by increasing the short glass fiber content powder properties as well as part properties are immensely affected . By adding glass fibers powder properties like flowability and diffuse reflection decrease . The isothermal crystallization changes resulting in a narrower processing window . Concerning mechanical properties short glass fibers allow for a higher stiffness until a critical limit of filler concentration within this study is reached after which the tensile strength decreases . The elongation of break decreases by rising the filler content .

@highlight The isothermal crystallization behavior of glass fibers on polyamide 12 during selective laser beam melting is detected.
@highlight Theoretical considerations and calculations concerning the critical fiber length in selective laser beam melting are made.
@highlight The optical behavior of the powder systems is changed due to glass fillers.
@highlight Above the critical fiber content of around 30 vol. the part porosity gets too high due to unsufficient wetting.
