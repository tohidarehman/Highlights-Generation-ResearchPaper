 In the present study the structure of the secondary rainbow is examined for the case of a spherical drop illuminated by a Gaussian beam with its waist radius comparable to the drop radius . Computations are performed using the generalized Lorenz Mie theory and Debye series . The influence of beam waist radius on the secondary rainbow pattern is investigated . The possibility of extracting size and refractive index from the secondary rainbow pattern is then evaluated by examining the achievable accuracy . The influence of incident position of the beam on extracting drop information is also investigated . For a Gaussian beam centered on the impact parameter associated with the Descartes ray the absolute error of the refractive index is smaller than 6.810
