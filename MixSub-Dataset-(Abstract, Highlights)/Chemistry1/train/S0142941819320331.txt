 The objective of the study was to determine the effects of molecular sizes of amylose and starch granules on the mechanical properties of thermoplastic starch blend films . Leached amylose solution from cassava and mung bean and two forms of amylopectin granular

@highlight Different film matrices of starch blend films with 26 AM content were fabricated.
@highlight Types of AM and granule conformation controlled film microstructure.
@highlight Film strength is affected by the range of molecular size distribution and granule remnants.
@highlight Non granular amylopectin matrix with a wide range of size distribution increased elongation.
