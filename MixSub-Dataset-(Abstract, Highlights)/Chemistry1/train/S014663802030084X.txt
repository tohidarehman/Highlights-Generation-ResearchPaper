 Gas chromatographymass spectrometry and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonancemass spectrometry analyses were performed on 39 heavy oils from an onshore basin in southeastern Mexico to investigate the influence of biodegradation on whole oil compositions . Among the biodegradation resistant C

@highlight A C
@highlight bicyclane specific to southeastern Mexico oils is biodegradation resistant.
@highlight A new C
@highlight bicyclane biodegradation parameter is proposed to indicate PM 45.
@highlight Biodegradation ratios based on hydrocarbons and non hydrocarbons correlate well.
@highlight Non hydrocarbon compounds are valuable for assessing heavy biodegradation.
