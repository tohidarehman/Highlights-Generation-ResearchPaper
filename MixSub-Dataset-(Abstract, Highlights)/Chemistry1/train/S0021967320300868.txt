 Peptide retention time prediction models have been developed for zwitter ionic ZIC HILIC and ZIC cHILIC stationary phases using proteomics derived retention datasets of 30 thousand tryptic peptides each . Overall hydrophilicity of these stationary phases was found to be similar to the previously studied Amide HILIC phase but lower compared to bare silicas . Peptide retention is driven by interactions of all charged residues at pH 4.5 but shows specificity according to orientation of functional groups in zwitter ionic pair . Thus ZIC cHILIC exhibits an increased contribution of negatively charged Asp and Glu due to the distal positioning of positively charged quaternary amines on the stationary phase . These findings confirm that HILIC interactions are driven by both peptide distribution between water layer adsorbed on the stationary phase and by interactions specific to functional groups of the packing material . Sequence Specific Retention Calculator HILIC models were optimized for these columns showing 0.9670.976 R
