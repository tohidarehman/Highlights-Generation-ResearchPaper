 The chemical composition distribution of three single site made ethylene 1 octene copolymers was investigated through offline hyphenation of solvent gradient interaction chromatography with

@highlight SGIC fractionation NMR proves SGIC separation by short chain branching.
@highlight Elution time is related to short chain branching content by a quadratic equation.
@highlight 2D LC Chemical composition related changes in molar mass distribution.
@highlight Relative intensity based results differ only marginally between ELSD and IR.
