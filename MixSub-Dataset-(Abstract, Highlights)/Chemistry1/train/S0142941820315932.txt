 Composite scaffolds of polymers tricalcium phosphate have been widely used for bone regeneration due to the combination of osteoinductivity of TCP and mechanical properties of the polymers . However the difference in surface properties of the two material causes composite has poor uniformity and weak two phase interaction resulting in poor TCP release and weak new bone forming ability . In this research a TCP sol was developed to replace traditional TCP nanoparticles for the preparation of homogeneous polycaprolactone TCP sol nanofibrous scaffolds . It was found that compared with TCP nanoparticles TCP sol homogeneously distributed in PCL nanofibers and greatly improved the hydrophilicity biodegradability and mechanical properties of the scaffolds . It is also confirmed that loading TCP sol promoted the formation of bone like apatite on the surface of the scaffolds . Biological experiments showed that all scaffolds supported rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells proliferation especially scaffolds loaded with TCP sol . The increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen production enhanced calcium deposition and up regulation of osteocalcin expression demonstrated that the loading TCP sol expanded an advantage of scaffolds in promoting rBMSCs osteogenic differentiation suggesting it dramatically improved the osteoinductive activity of PCL TCP hybrid system and had a great potential application in bone regeneration .
