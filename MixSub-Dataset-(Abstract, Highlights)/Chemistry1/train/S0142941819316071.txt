 Focusing on potential biological and pharmaceutical activities of rosmarinic acid this study was conducted with the aim of improving the long term stability of RA by one step fabrication of a novel ternary electrosprayed microparticle system based on poly where surfactant molecules served as the compatibilizer modifying interfacial properties of RA and PLGA . Effects of polymer concentration and initial ratio of RA to PLGA in the presence of surfactant molecules on microparticle morphology release profile and bioactivities were studied . Particle size and loading efficiency were respectively increased and decreased by increasing either the initial ratio of RA to PLGA or the polymer concentration . RA release from microparticles followed Fickian or quasi Fickian diffusion mechanism . The location of drug inside microparticles resulted from surfactant associated polymer drug interaction was found as the dominant rate controlling release mechanism while the microparticle size played a collaborative role . RA loaded PLGA microparticles exhibited antioxidant and antibacterial activities and released no major harmful substance to human dermal fibroblasts . The evidence suggests that electrosprayed RA loaded PLGA microparticles can be employed in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products .

@highlight Anhydrous PLGA RA solution was prepared with the assistance of surfactant.
@highlight Spherical PLGA microparticles containing RA were successfully electrosprayed.
@highlight Location of RA inside microparticles was dominant rate controlling release mechanism.
@highlight Microparticle size collaborated in controlling the release rate.
@highlight RA loaded into microparticles preserved antioxidant and anti bacterial activities.
