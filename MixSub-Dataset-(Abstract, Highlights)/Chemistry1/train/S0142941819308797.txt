 Polymeric electrospun nanofibers have been gaining notoriety in the same way as their industrial applications since the manufacturing of this type of material is simple and low costed . In order to obtain fibrous polymeric material with small diameters and with reduced beads formation a 2

@highlight The electrospun nanofibers with 21 CA and 0.5 CPB w v are bead free.
@highlight The CPB addiction in CA solution was made based in a factorial experiment.
@highlight The average diameters of the nanofibers ranged from 0.2 to 0.3m.
@highlight The surfactant presence on CA nanofibers improve thermal and mechanical characteristics.
@highlight This CA CPB nanofiber could be applied as an air filter.
