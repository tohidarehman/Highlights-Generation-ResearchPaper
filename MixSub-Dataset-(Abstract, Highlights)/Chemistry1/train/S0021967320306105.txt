 Two structural isomeric pentacyclic triterpenes oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were considered as the models for the quality control of many traditional Chinese herbal medicines and they have been proved to own important pharmacological activities . In the present work liquid chromatographic and liquid liquid chromatographic separation with high peak resolution of structural isomeric oleanolic acid and ursolic acid using hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin as mobile phase additive was successfully achieved respectively . A high peak resolution R

@highlight Liquid chromatography and liquid liquid chromatography of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were achieved.
@highlight High peak resolution Rs 8.0 was achieved for separation of the two components.
@highlight Formation constants of inclusion complex between two components and cyclodextrin were determined.
@highlight We reported an alternative method for separation of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid.
