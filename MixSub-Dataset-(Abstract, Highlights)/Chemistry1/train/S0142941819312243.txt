 Glass fiber is becoming one of the most popular reinforcement materials used in many fields . However it still has some disadvantages such as brittleness and poor wear resistance . In order to improve its tribological property the GF was modified and use high density polyethylene as the matrix material to verify it . In this work friction tests of HDPE samples with seven different compositions of modified GF were carried out . Different working conditions were applied to determine the tribological properties and service life as used in water lubricated bearings . Their friction coefficient surface morphology wear scar wear quality and wear mechanism were investigated . The results showed that the modified GF could significantly improve the HDPE tribological properties . Moreover the wear mechanism of pure HDPE was mainly adhesive wear and slight fatigue wear and the composite material was mainly abrasive wear . The 30 GF composite material had the best wear resistance its friction coefficient was reduced by 51.56 under 0.4MPa and 500 r min . The findings from this experiment will provide a new method for reducing friction and wear of water lubricated bearings .
