 Byproducts from artichoke represent the majority of the mass collected from the plant and constitute an interesting source of bioactive compounds such as inositols and caffeoylquinic acids . In this work a microwave assisted extraction methodology was developed for the simultaneous extraction of these compounds from artichoke stalks leaves receptacles and external bracts . Optimal MAE conditions to maximize the extraction of these bioactives and the antioxidant activity were 97C 3min ethanol water . Moreover a GCMS methodology was also developed for the simultaneous determination of these compounds in a single run optimal derivatization conditions were achieved using hexamethyldisilazane and

@highlight Inositols and caffeoylquinic acids from artichoke were analyzed by GCMS.
@highlight Regarding derivatization best results were achieved with HMDS and BSTFA 1 TMCS.
@highlight A MAE method was optimized for extraction of these bioactives from artichoke bracts.
@highlight Optimal conditions were applied to different artichoke byproducts.
@highlight Receptacles were the richest in caffeoylquinic acids and leaves were in inositols.
