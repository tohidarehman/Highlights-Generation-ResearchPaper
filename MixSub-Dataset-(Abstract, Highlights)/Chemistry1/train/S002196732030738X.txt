 Despite the extensive use of electrospray ionization for the quantification of neuropeptides by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry poor ionization and transmission efficiency are described for this ionization interface . A new atmospheric pressure ionization source named UniSpray was recently developed and commercialized . In this study the LC MS performance of this new ionization interface is evaluated and compared with ESI for the quantification of seven neuropeptides . Besides comparison of signal intensities and charge state distributions also signal to noise ratios and accuracy and precision were assessed . Additionally matrix effects of human precipitated plasma and rat microdialysate were evaluated as well as the effect of three supercharging agents on the ionization of the seven neuropeptides . UniSpray ionization resulted in signal intensities four to eight times higher at the optimal capillary impactor voltage for all seven neuropeptides . S N values at the other hand only increased by not more than a twofold when the UniSpray source was used . Moreover UniSpray ionization resulted in a shift towards lower charge states for some neuropeptides . Evaluation of the matrix effects by a post column infusion set up resulted in different infusion profiles between ESI and UniSpray . The charge state distributions of the neuropeptides obtained with UniSpray are highly comparable with ESI . Finally the effect of the supercharging agents on the ionization of the neuropeptides tends to be peptide dependent with both ionization sources .

@highlight UniSpray results in four to eight times higher signal intensities.
@highlight By use of UniSpray S N values only improved by less than a factor of 2.
@highlight A small shift towards lower charge states is observed for UniSpray.
@highlight When matrix effects were evaluated infusion profiles differed between both sources.
@highlight Supercharging agents affect the peptides differently for both sources.
