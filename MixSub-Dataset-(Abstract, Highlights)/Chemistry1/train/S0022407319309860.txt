 Atmospheric conditions can significantly affect the sky brightness originating from artificial lights . Previous works studied the cloudiness cloud base height optical depth of cloud aerosol optical depth and aerosol scale height as atmospheric parameters affecting night sky brightness . Instead of using these parameters as a simplification of the real cloud and aerosol profile we processed the raw backscatter data of a laser ceilometer instrument . Sky brightness was obtained from camera images available at the same meteorological observation site . Case studies are shown in selected cases where we analyzed the correspondences with the backscatter data and the camera images . We performed Monte Carlo simulations with the dominant light sources to verify the numerical predictions of sky radiances . Although the limitations of the ceilometer device to obtain optical properties of the atmosphere ceilometers provide valuable source of data for evaluation of the light pollution measurements .

@highlight Monte Carlo simulations were performed for skyglow modeling.
@highlight Ceilometer backscatter data were used as atmospheric input for skyglow modeling.
@highlight Reproduction of the sky radiance proved more successful with backscatter input data.
