 This work presents an experimental investigation into the effect of cornhusk fibre content upon the mechanical properties water absorption behaviour and swellability of CHF polyester composites used in water environments . The CHF PE was prepared at different volume fractions using hot compression . To investigate the rate of water absorption and swellability behaviours composites were immersed in water for varying durations . The mechanical properties of composites immersed in water were carefully evaluated . The results indicate that the composites with an increased CHF content and a longer immersion time are prone to lower mechanical properties . The large amount of water absorbed by the composite reduces the bonding interface between CHF and PE which is responsible for the damage . Moreover the amount of water absorbed and the swellability increase with a corresponding increase in the CHF content . The lowest water absorption was detected in 20 CHF and 80 PE composite immersed for 6 days . The findings gathered in this research endorse CHF polyester thermoset composites as a viable alternative for construction applications .
