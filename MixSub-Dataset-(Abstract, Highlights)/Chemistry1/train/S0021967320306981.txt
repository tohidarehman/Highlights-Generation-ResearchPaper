 Sialylation an important form of glycosylation is involved in many biological processes and plays an important role in the development of diseases . However due to the low abundance among various glycosylation and lack of efficient enrichment method with high specificity the study of sialylation remains a challenge . Herein multi histidine modified microspheres were synthesized to enrich sialylated glycopeptides . It was found that MHM could selectively enrich sialylated glycopeptides from over 100 times of non sialylated glycopeptides which indicated MHM possessed good enrichment specificity towards sialylated glycopeptides . Furthermore MHM were utilized to the large scale analysis of protein sialylation and 510 intact glycopeptides were identified with over 94.5 sialylated glycopeptide specificity from 4 L human serum . The good specificity could be attributed to the synergistic effect by the electrostatic interaction and hydrophilic interaction . Hence MHM could provide an alternative approach for the analysis of site specific sialylation at proteome level from complex biological samples .

@highlight We prepared a multiple histidine modified microspheres MHM to specifically enrich sialylated glycopeptides.
@highlight Sialylated glycopeptides could be enriched with MHM by electrostatic interaction hydrophilic interaction and synergistic effect.
@highlight MHM can enrich 510 intact glycopeptides from 4 L human serum with over 94.5 specificity in triple replicates.
