 Quantification of the gas streams from chemical systems such as catalytic reactors are routinely performed by on line gas chromatography . Gas chromatographs used for this purpose are typically provided with a combination of thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors to be able to detect and quantify both permanent gases CO

@highlight A method for characterizing gas streams with on line gas chromatography was designed.
@highlight The on line GC was provided with a TCD methanizer FID system of detection.
@highlight Quantification methods were developed considering mass balances in the system.
@highlight The internal and external standard methods for quantification were compared.
@highlight The internal standard method produced highly accurate mass balances.
