 In this work the synthesis of zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 crystals and their subsequent application as effective sorbents for extraction and preconcentration of several benzomercaptans from environmental complex samples is described . These materials were prepared by solvothermal approach varying the concentration of n butylamine modulator to modify the surface of the metal organic framework . The resulting materials were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy powder X ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy . The ZIF 8 material that gave the best features was selected as extractive phase and the influence of various parameters on the extraction efficiency of target compounds were investigated . Under the optimal conditions of the method the tested analytes were retained and eluted quantitatively with alkaline 50 50 methanol water mixture . Using the proposed method low limits of detection in the range of 1621ng L

@highlight Modulated synthesis of ZIF 8 MOFs with
@highlight  butylamine was done.
@highlight NH
@highlight  ZIF 8 BA 1 as SPE sorbent gave high extraction performance for benzomercaptans.
@highlight The MOF had large surface area hydrophilicity and enhanced adsorption capacity.
@highlight SPE LC method provided low LODs and satisfactory sorbent reusability.
@highlight The method was successfully applied to complex environmental samples.
