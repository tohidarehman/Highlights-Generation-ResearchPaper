 In this work we present a thorough theoretical structure and spectroscopic study of the ground and low lying excited states of RbBa molecule . High level

@highlight The PECs of the 16 S states have been calculated.
@highlight The PECs of the 33 states arising from spin orbit coupling of 16 S states have been studied.
@highlight Permanent and transition dipole moments and vibrational energy levels have been calculated for all states.
@highlight Stimulated black body and spontaneous transition rates of vibrational states of the ground state were evaluated.
@highlight The possibly of direct laser cooling for RbBa molecule have been discussed.
