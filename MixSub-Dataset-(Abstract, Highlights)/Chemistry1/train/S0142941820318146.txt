 The development of novel composite materials with beneficial mechanical thermal and electrical properties often focus only on the final properties of the products . However in many cases their significant application potential may be suppressed by limitations resulting from their rheological and processing properties . The isotactic polypropylene composites filled with basalt powder are known for their good thermomechanical stability and stiffness . The paper presents the complex results of off line rheological measurements related to processing behavior obtained in a laboratory conditions with the use of a processing machine which allow understanding the different manner of the processing behavior occurring during the melt processing of iPP BP composites . It was found that the addition of BP may cause unusual beneficial effect of lowered viscosity of the melt . While the addition of up to 5wt of BP results in a profitable reduction of the pressure in the barrel during extrusion without influence on the throughput a higher amount of the filler may lead to significant processing limitations due to strong wall slip .

@highlight Polypropylene iPP with basalt powder BP composites were manufactured by extrusion.
@highlight Off line rheological results were correlated with extrusion processing conditions.
@highlight Low amounts of BP 5wt caused improved processability of iPP.
@highlight Unusual rheological behavior of polypropylene basalt composites was found.
@highlight The addition of BP induced strong wall slip during capillary flow of iPP BP composites.
