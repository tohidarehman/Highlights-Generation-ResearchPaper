 The characterisation of the energetic properties of liquid crystals i.e . esters with elongated molecules has been performed . The changes of the free energies of adsorption and absorption

@highlight IGC technique is employed to explore of the variation of the Gibbs free energy 
@highlight  and free energy 
@highlight  of adsorption and dissolution at the temperatures characteristic for crystalline smectic and nematic phases.
@highlight The physicochemical properties of liquid crystalline stationary phases and the widening of the Dorris Gray concept on the liquid crystalline phases is proposed.
@highlight The interpretation based on a precise van der Waals component of the surface free energy 
@highlight  is presented in a more detailed form.
