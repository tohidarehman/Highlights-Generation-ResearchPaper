 For organic inorganic composite materials the spatial dispersion of inorganic fillers in the organic matrix is of great significance for designing and manufacturing high performance composite materials . To improve the understanding of the micro physical mechanism of the filler reinforced polymer matrix we studied the relationship between filler network structure and macro mechanical properties of silicone rubber by using fluorescent labeling technology and three dimensional visualization imaging . The experimental results showed that a good filler network structure in the polymer matrix can more effectively dissipate external mechanical energy which generate a visible mechanical strengthening effect . Additionally this visualization method truly reflects the macrodispersion of the filler and the evolution of the filler network structure under dynamic stress due to its non invasive and intuitive characteristics which provides new theoretical guidance for the design of high performance composites .
