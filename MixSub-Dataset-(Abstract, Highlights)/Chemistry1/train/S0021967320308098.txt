 Novel core shell structured magnetic covalent organic frameworks were synthesized at room temperature and first applied in water samples for the enrichment of trace polybrominated diphenyl ethers through magnetic solid phase extraction . The prepared materials were characterized through transmission electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy X ray diffraction vibrating sample magnetometer and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy . During adsorption the parameters affecting extraction and desorption efficiency were further optimized . Combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed that high enrichment factors low limits of detection 0.120.38ngL

@highlight Novel core shell magnetic nanospheres were synthesized at room temperature.
@highlight MSPE NCI GC MS was used for PBDEs analysis in water with high recovery.
@highlight Good adsorption of PBDEs was achieved probably by hydrophobic and interaction.
