 Adsorption of O and Cl on Tl Si is studied using density functional theory . The surface of the Cl Tl Si system was found to be metallic while that for O Tl Si semiconducting . It is found however that the O Tl and Cl Tl interactions in Tl Si are very similar in nature and lead to the formation of the Tl O and Tl Cl bilayers weakly bonded to the Si 11 substrate . The spin polarization of the Tl induced gap states originally present in Tl Si is also suppressed in both systems .
