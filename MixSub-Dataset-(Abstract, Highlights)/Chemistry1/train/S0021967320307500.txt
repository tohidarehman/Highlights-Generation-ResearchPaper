 A heart cut multidimensional gas chromatographymass spectrometry method for separation and identification of triacylglycerols in extra virgin olive oil was developed . A GC configuration comprising a non polar first dimension

@highlight A high temperature multidimensional GC method is established for triacylglycerol analysis.
@highlight The first dimension low polarity column gives incomplete separation of TAG components.
@highlight Narrow multidimensional heartcuts are taken over regions of first column peak overlap.
@highlight A medium polarity second column allows adequate separation of selected TAG components.
@highlight Mass spectrometry is used to provide tentative identification of the TAG.
