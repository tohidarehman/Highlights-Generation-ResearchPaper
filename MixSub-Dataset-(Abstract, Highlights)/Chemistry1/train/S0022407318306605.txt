 To evaluate characteristics of the low lying electronic states and the feasibility of the laser cooling of the AuH molecule we investigate the potential energy curves the vibrational and rotational characteristics of the ground and low lying excited electronic states based on

@highlight The optical laser cooling scheme is suggested for AuH.
@highlight The cooling effect is evaluated with Einstein coefficient and recoil temperature.
@highlight The potential energy curves of ten electronic states of AuH molecule are obtained.
@highlight The spectroscopic parameters the rovibrational energy levels are determined.
@highlight The FranckCondon and transition dipole moments are calculated for the states.
