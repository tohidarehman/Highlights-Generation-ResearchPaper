 The description of the profiles of chromatographic peaks has been studied extensively with a large number of proposed mathematical functions . Among them the accuracy achieved with modified Gaussian models that describe the deviation of an ideal Gaussian peak as a change in the peak variance or standard deviation over time has been highlighted . These models are in fact a family of functions of different complexity with great flexibility to adjust chromatographic peaks over a wide range of asymmetries and shapes . However an uncontrolled behaviour of the signal may occur outside the region being fitted forcing the use of different strategies to overcome this problem . In this work the performance of the LMG PVMG and PLMG models is compared with variants obtained by combination of the modified Gaussian models with an equation that adds an exponential tail and with other functions that limit the growth of the independent variable . The behaviour of the approaches is checked through the simultaneous fitting of enantiomeric peaks showing a wide range of characteristics obtained in the separation of drugs with chiral activity by liquid chromatography using enantioselective columns . The study is also carried out with the purpose of performing the deconvolution of the peaks of the enantiomers when these are not completely resolved in order to evaluate the enantiomeric fraction .

@highlight Modified Gaussian models were applied to fit peaks of enantiomeric compounds
@highlight Restrictions were applied to control the baseline out of the peak region
@highlight Peak models allowed excellent fitting of isolated symmetric and asymmetric peaks
@highlight Deconvolution of peaks with moderate overlapping was also satisfactory
@highlight Approaches were applied to eight drugs analysed with several chiral columns
