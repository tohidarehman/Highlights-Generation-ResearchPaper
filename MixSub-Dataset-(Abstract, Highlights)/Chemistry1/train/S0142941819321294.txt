 In this study poly scaffolds were printed and reinforced simultaneously with biodegradable poly glycolic acid suture yarn as a continuous reinforcing fiber in the Fused Deposition Modeling 3D printing process . Albeit PCL is a suitable material for biomedical applications its low mechanical properties and low degradation rate have limited its usage . A biocompatible suture yarn was used as the reinforcing material to enhance the mechanical properties and biodegradation characteristics via an innovative method of continuous fiber embedding in the FDM process . The reinforced PCL samples were 3D printed with the setting porosity value of 60 and 0 60 120 lay down pattern . The mechanical and biological properties of the scaffolds were tested to prove the effectiveness of the produced scaffolds for bone substitute purposes . Mechanical properties assessments showed that with a 22 vol . suture yarn content in the 3D printed PCL scaffolds the tensile strength and elastic modulus remarkably increased up to 374 and 775 respectively . The degradation of the reinforced PCL was 20 times higher than that of the non reinforced PCL samples after ten weeks dominated by the fiber degradation phenomenon . After three days of cell culture the proliferation assay of the built scaffovd the non toxicity of the reinforced PCL .
