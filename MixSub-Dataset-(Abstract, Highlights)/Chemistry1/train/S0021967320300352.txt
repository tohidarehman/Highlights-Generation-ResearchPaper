 The present contribution reports on the practical implementation and validation of a new experimental method to determine the radial dispersion D

@highlight Flow segmentation can be used to measure radial dispersion coefficient D
@highlight  in practice.
@highlight Mass flow meter feedback can be used to correct flow rate mismatches.
@highlight Method validated by showing independence of relative central flow rate and tracer concentration.
@highlight Measured D
@highlight  values higher than in most engineering literature reports but still within cited range.
