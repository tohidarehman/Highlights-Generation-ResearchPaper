 Oligosaccharides are gaining importance because of their beneficial properties in human health . They normally appear in natural and synthetic products as complex mixtures of different monomeric units glycosidic linkages and degrees of polymerization being disaccharides and trisaccharides usually the most abundant ones . Although liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is a useful technique for oligosaccharides analysis the similarity of their structures makes difficult their characterization . Moreover there is still scarce information about the relationship between carbohydrate chemical structure mass spectra and chromatographic data . Then in this work chromatographic parameters for 23 disaccharides with different linkages and monomeric units were determined using porous graphitized and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography columns . Moreover diagnostic ions of these disaccharides obtained by tandem mass spectra MS

@highlight Chromatographic behavior of 23 disaccharides on HILIC and PGC columns was evaluated.
@highlight MS
@highlight characteristic ions of disaccharides were established by SLDA.
@highlight Structural characterization of trisaccharides was successfully achieved by SLDA application.
