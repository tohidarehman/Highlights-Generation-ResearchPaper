 There is a huge still increasing market for synthetic and therapeutic peptides . Their quality control is commonly based on a generic reversed phase liquid chromatography method with C18 stationary phase and acetonitrile gradient with 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid in the mobile phase . It performs exceptionally well for a wide variety of impurities yet structurally closely related impurities with similar sequences not resolved in preparative RPLC may easily coelute in the corresponding QC run as well . To address this problem an advanced generic 2D LC impurity profiling method was developed in this work . It employs a selective comprehensive RPRP 2D LC separation using a 1002.1mm ID column with the common acidic generic gradient in the first dimension while RPLC under basic pH on a short 303mm ID column is used in the second dimension . Recording data with a UV detector at 215nm after
