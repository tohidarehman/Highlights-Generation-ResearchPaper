 The suitability of supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to accurate mass spectrometry for the determination of seven commercial neonicotinoid pesticides and one transformation product in wine samples has been investigated . Thorough optimization of the different parameters affecting the SFC MS selectivity and sensitivity was carried out . Under final conditions a 2mL volume of either red or white wine was extracted by SPE and analysed using external standard calibration achieving limits of quantification from 1 to 11ng mL

@highlight SFC MS optimized parameters for neonicotinoid pesticides analysis.
@highlight High extraction yields and low matrix effects for SPE wine extracts.
@highlight Superior performance of SFC MS compared to UPLC MS.
@highlight Imidacloprid residues often found in wine samples.
