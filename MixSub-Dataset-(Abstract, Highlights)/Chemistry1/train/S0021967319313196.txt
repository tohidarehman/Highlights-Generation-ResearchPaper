 The need for the control of rodent populations with anticoagulant rodenticides remains actual and enantioselective analytical methods are mandatory to understand ecotoxicity issues of those chiral pesticides . This study presents two enantioselective methods to achieve the residue levels and differentiated persistence of the four stereoisomers of difethialone which is one of the most toxic second generation anticoagulant rodenticide . Their enantiomeric fraction evaluation in biological matrices of rats was determined by two LC MS MS methods . The first one combined a chiral column employed in reversed phase mode to be compatible with mass spectrometry detection . The second one was also a LC MS MS method but with a reversed phase column after a derivatization step with camphanic chloride . Extraction process combined Solid Liquid extraction and sorbent cartridges . The methods were fully validated . The chiral column was chosen as a reference method for our laboratory because it was quicker and cheaper and enantioresolution and sensitivity were better . This chiral LC MS MS method was used to measure the enantiomeric fraction of the four stereoisomers of difethialone in rodent biological matrices of female rats treated with 3.5mg kg of difethialone . The results showed that metabolism is not the same for all the stereoisomers cis E3 difethialone was the most persistent and E4 trans difethialone was the most quickly eliminated .
