 We describe the design and performance evaluation of a portable gas chromatograph suitable for the analysis of volatile organic and odorous compounds at trace levels . The system comprises a carbon nanotube sponge preconcentrator an electronic pressure control unit a temperature programmable column module and a fast response photoionization detector . A built in tablet computer controls instrumental parameters and chromatogram display functions . The compact GC with dimensions of 35 cm 26 cm 15 cm is self contained weighing less than 5 kg without a battery pack and uses no auxiliary compressed gases . Our design has three main advantages over conventional portable GCs recharging configuration of ambient air as the carrier gas using a miniature diaphragm pump precise control of column flow by the built in canister and EPC system and rapid thermal desorption of the preconcentrator facilitated by intrinsic resistivity of the carbon nanotube sponge . A 30 m 0.28 mm I.D . capillary column operated at a head pressure of 14 psi provided a peak capacity of 55 for a 10 min isothermal analysis . The temperature programmability feature could decrease the analysis time of less than 5 min for vapor mixture of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and

@highlight GC analysis 10 min of volatile organics at sub ppb levels was done
@highlight Electronic pressure control facilitated use of compressed ambient air as carrier gas
@highlight Temperature programming was achieved by the at column heater and insulation module
@highlight Photoionization detector exhibited a fast response 90 ms 
@highlight Sensitivity was increased 100 fold using a carbon nanotube sponge preconcentrator
