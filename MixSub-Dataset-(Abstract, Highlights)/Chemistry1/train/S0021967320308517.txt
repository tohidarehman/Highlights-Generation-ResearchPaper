 Polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles as a group of major sulfur containing compounds widely occur in crude oil and its refined products . Accurate analyses of these petrochemical components play an important role in monitoring oil quality forensic source identification and assessment of environmental impact of an oil spill . PASHs occur at relatively lower abundances in most crude oils and refined petroleum products than their corresponding aromatic hydrocarbons and are co eluted together with some petroleum hydrocarbons in chromatographic analysis resulting in high uncertainty for their quantitation . Capillary gas chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry provides high resolution and high mass accuracy which facilitates discrimination of the delicate mass defects of isobaric compounds with the same nominal mass and external matrix material . In this work GC QTOF MS was applied to analyze bicyclic to pentacyclic PASHs including benzothiophenes dibenzothiophenes benzonaphthothiophenes dinaphthothiophenes and their C
