 Driven by the market demand several synthetic and natural grafts have been proposed during the last years for tendons regeneration . The synthetic grafts which present a better mechanical performance than the natural ones usually fail due to the lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity . Thus chitosan was immobilized on polypropylene surface previously activated by plasma treatment in order to improve the fibroblasts adhesion and proliferation on it . The

@highlight PP is a polymer that can be used for tendon repair due to better mechanical performance when compared to natural polymers.
@highlight To improve PP biocompatibility chitosan Cs was used as a source of amino groups to be grafted on PP substrates.
@highlight Grafting was done by plasma activation conditions of the substrate followed by diverse immersion parameters on Cs solution.
@highlight Physicochemical features confirmed grafting optimization.
@highlight Cell assays showed major improvement on the biocompatibility of the treated PP substrate when compared to the untreated one.
