 In this work we present the modeling of the peak deceleration using data of the experimental drop test . Specimens with different thicknesses and areas tested in the drop test device which has adaptable height and weight . In the empirical modeling of the PD the thickness area drop mass and drop height considered as separable functions . An analytical model and Neural Network was used as the empirical models . Further the stress on the material was calculated using differential equations and the Finite Element Method . The Obtained PD from the experimental test analytical and NN models was converted to the stress on the material using a derived differential equation . Finally the best model for analyzing the PD and Stress on the material was presented .
