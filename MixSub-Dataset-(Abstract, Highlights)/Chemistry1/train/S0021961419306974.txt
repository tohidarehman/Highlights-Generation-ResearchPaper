 Thermodynamics of phase transitions of long chain linear alcohols were revised by means of complementary experimental techniques transpiration differential scanning calorimetry fast scanning calorimetry and solution calorimetry . Absolute vapor pressure temperature dependencies for heptadecanol 1 and octadecanol 1 were measured by the transpiration and FSC methods . The validity and accuracy of the FSC experimental setup towards reliable vapor pressure measurement was established . It was shown that vaporization enthalpies for heptadecanol 1 and octadecanol 1 obtained by FSC and transpiration method are in good agreement . The SC approach was used for estimation of sublimation vaporization enthalpies of linear alcohols . Energetics of the phase transitions found with the SC approach agree well with that from conventional methods and they are consistent with each other .
