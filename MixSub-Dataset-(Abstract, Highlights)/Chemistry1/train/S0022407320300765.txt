 The mechanisms of coupling between the lattice modes of a two dimensional array consisting of Al nanoparticles and the localized modes of individual Al nanoparticles have been studied in detail . The results were obtained employing the finite difference time domain method and the generalized Mie theory . It was shown that interactions of single particles with 2D lattice modes significantly change the extinction spectra depending on the particle radius and the lattice period . The Rayleigh anomalies of higher orders contribute to formation of hybrid modes resulting in increase of the extinction efficiency in short wavelength range of the spectrum . It was shown that high intensity magnetic modes are excited in aluminum nanoparticles arrays . The patterns of spatial electromagnetic field distribution at the frequencies of hybrid modes have been studied . We note that comprehensive understanding the mode coupling mechanisms in arrays paves the way for engineering different types of modern photonic devices with controllable optical properties .
