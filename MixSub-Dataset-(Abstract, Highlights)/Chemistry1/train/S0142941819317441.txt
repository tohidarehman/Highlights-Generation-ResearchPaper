 Supramolecular structure can be formed using noncovalent interactions based on the self assembly processes . DNA is a good example for supramolecular materials because it is able to form supramolecular structure by forming specific hydrogen bonds between its base pairs . Moreover DNA as an anionic medium can bind with oppositely charged materials to form complex structures of various shapes and properties . This work is focused on a foam complex that is formed between negatively charged DNA and positive chitosan . Various characterizations Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy Small and Wide angle X ray scattering scanning electron microscope texture analyzer and differential scanning calorimetry are used to study the properties of this dried scaffold . The FTIR spectra presented the chemical structure of DNA and chitosan . While the SAXS power law decay has revealed that an increasing of chitosan content smoothens the surface of the structure on the other hand the roughness is much higher when the DNA content is increased . The melting point of the foam from the DSC scan has been identified . The mechanical property of foam is suitable for the application of scaffold and there is no cytotoxicity of foam to the cell . It is expected that this type of biomaterial could be used in several applications such as functional material and as a drug delivery material .
