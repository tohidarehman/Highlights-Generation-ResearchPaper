 Velvet antlers have been used as medicines and nutraceuticals for over 2000 years . Meanwhile deer antlers are the only mammalian organs that can fully regenerate after annual shedding . The antler formation and regeneration rely on the stem cells resident in antlerogenic periosteum transplantation of which can induce ectopic antler formation . Here a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis of antlerogenic periosteal cells compared with the adjacent facial periosteal cells was carried out from both extracellular and intracellular perspectives . In this study the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture was applied to ensure the precision of quantification . Then the protein equalization strategy and reverse phase liquid chromatography separation in high pH were utilized to improve the depth of proteome profiling . Proteomics analysis of the conditioned media from AP and FP cells showed that significantly over expressed extracellular proteins in AP cells were involved in cell proliferation angiogenesis and neurogenesis . Combining the extracellular and intracellular proteomes we found several potential secreted proteins might regulate antler formation and regeneration such as SFRP4 and LUM . These results provide new insight into the underlying mechanism of antler formation and regeneration .
