 The present manuscript focuses on the effect of pH on the thermomechanical and water uptake properties of plasma protein based bioplastics . Therefore pH was modified through addition of either an acid or a base and subsequent freeze drying . Flours obtained were then blended with a plasticizer in a 1 1 ratio and next injection moulded to produce diverse bioplastics . A different behaviour of the eventual bioplastics depending on the pH was observed . Thus the poorest mechanical properties and the maximum water uptake capacity were displayed by the sample prepared at the most acidic conditions . On the other hand the lowest water uptake was found at the isoelectric point being related to the hindering of electrostatic interactions due to the absence of net charges . The microstructure observed after swelling and freeze drying helped to explain the greater mechanical properties displayed by the sample at pH 8 compared to pH 3 .

@highlight At the isoelectric point bioplastic water absorption is hindered.
@highlight At pH different to the isoelectric point plasma bioplastics are superabsorbent.
@highlight Strong electrostatic repulsion reduces the mechanical strength of bioplastics.
@highlight Physical gelation is promoted at low pH values.
@highlight Thermal cross linking is promoted at high pH values.
