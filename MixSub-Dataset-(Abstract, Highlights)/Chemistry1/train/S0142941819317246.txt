 Fatty acid based alkyd resins prepared with different amounts of glycerol and pentaerythritol were characterized . Sacha inchi oil and linseed oil were used as fatty acids sources . FT IR and

@highlight Sacha inchi based alkyds had an equivalent behaviour to linseed oil based ones.
@highlight Final colour of sacha inchi fatty acid based alkyd resins was lighter.
@highlight Pentaerythritol retarded oxygen uptake during crosslinking process.
@highlight Pentaerythritol increased viscosity and thermal stability of alkyds.
@highlight Sacha inchi oil s fatty acids are new alternative sources for resin formulation.
