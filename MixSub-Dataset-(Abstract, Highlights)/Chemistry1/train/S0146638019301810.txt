 Birch bark tar an organic material frequently encountered during archaeological excavations has been identified from its lipid composition on the cracks of a ceramic dated to the late Neolithic . Lipids of this black substance were dominated by a characteristic triterpenoid assemblage of lupane related triterpenoids from birch bark together with their thermal degradation products formed during preparation of the tar . Among the latter four main series of unusual triterpenoid esters have been detected and were postulated to correspond to esters of

@highlight Betulin related esters in archaeological samples were identified via synthesis.
@highlight They are formed by reaction of suberin fatty acids and betulin related triterpenoids.
@highlight They are potential new biomarkers of strong heating upon tar preparation.
