 In this study a novel and straightforward analytical methodology was proposed for the determination of cocaine and its main metabolites benzoylecgonine cocaethylene and hydroxycocaine COC

@highlight A high throughput membrane based microextraction approach was successfully developed for the analysis of urine samples.
@highlight The HFRLM 96 well plate method allowed for the preparation of up to 96 samples within 35min.
@highlight The quantification of cocaine and its metabolites was possible with low sample and reagent consumption.
@highlight The method developed exhibited excellent analytical performance.
