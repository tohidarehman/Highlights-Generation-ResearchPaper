 Polymer grafted media have been a focus of recent development for ion exchange chromatography because of their capacity and uptake kinetics that can lead to high dynamic capacity in protein purification . This work is devoted to developing novel cation exchangers of high adsorption performance by grafting polymerization of sodium methacrylate onto a commercial agarose gel Sepharose FF . Five polyMA grafted FF gels were prepared with the same grafting density but different chain lengths and named as FF pMA

@highlight Synthesis of poly methacrylate grafted Sepharose of different chain lengths.
@highlight Capacities of lysozyme and globulin reached maximum at different chain lengths.
@highlight The highest uptake rates of the two proteins were reached at 100 mmol L NaCl.
@highlight The ion exchangers kept high dynamic binding capacities at 100 mmol L NaCl.
