 Automatic data analysis for gas chromatography mass spectrometry is a challenging task in untargeted metabolomics . In this work we provide a novel comprehensive data analysis strategy for GC MS based untargeted metabolomics by developing a new automatic strategy for performing TIC peak detection and resolution and proposing a novel time shift correction and component registration algorithm . autoGCMSDataAnal uses original acquired GC MS datafiles as input to automatically perform TIC peak detection component resolution time shift correction and component registration statistical analysis and compound identification . We utilize standards and complex plant samples to comprehensively investigate the performance of autoGCMSDataAnal . The results suggest that the developed strategy is comparable with several state of the art methods that are widely used in GC MS based untargeted metabolomics . Based on the proposed strategy we develop a user friendly MATLAB GUI for users who are unfamiliar with programming languages to facilitate their routine analysis which can be freely downloaded at
