 Apparent molar volumes apparent molar isentropic compressibilities and relative viscosities for streptomycin sulphate aqueous solutions at different compositions of solute as also cosolute are determined from experimental set of densities speeds of sound and viscosities collected at different temperatures . Infinite dilution values of apparent molar volumes and apparent molar isentropic compressibilities using least squares fittings of appropriate equations are correlated in terms of solutesolute and solutesolvent interactions . The various parameters in relation to densities and speeds of sound are also evaluated . The viscosity data has been used to determine Falkenhagen coefficient

@highlight Density speed of sound and viscosity of ternary systems are investigated.
@highlight Thermodynamic properties are evaluated for various concentrations and temperatures.
@highlight UVvisible studies have also been recorded for present systems.
@highlight The solute behaves as structure maker in the ternary systems.
@highlight The results are discussed in terms of hydrophilic ionic interactions.
