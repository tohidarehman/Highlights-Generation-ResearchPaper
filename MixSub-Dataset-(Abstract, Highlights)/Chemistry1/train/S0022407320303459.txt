 We use a recently developed version of the configuration method for open shells to study electronic structure of erbium and fermium atoms . We calculate excitation energies of odd states connected to the even ground state by electric dipole transitions the corresponding transition rates isotope shift hyperfine structure ionization potentials and static scalar polarizabilities . We argue that measuring isotope shift for several transitions can be used to study nuclear deformation in even even nuclei . This is important for testing nuclear theory and for searching for the hypothetical island of stability . Since erbium and fermium have similar electronic structures calculations for erbium serve as a guide to the accuracy of the calculations .
