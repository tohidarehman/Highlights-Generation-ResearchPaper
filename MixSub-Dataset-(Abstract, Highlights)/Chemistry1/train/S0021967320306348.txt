 The presence of organophosphate esters in everyday commodities such as furniture household appliances and baby toys have rendered these contaminants ubiquitous in environmental fates such as air water soils and biota . Their presence in food related species suggests that an additional route of exposure to these esters for the general population is fish intake through diet . Their incipient toxicity and carcinogenetic behaviour make it essential to develop methods for determining OPEs in fish samples . In this paper we have developed a new method for determining 9 OPEs based on the QuEChERS extraction method followed by a simple clean up using a novel device for selective lipid removal and GCMS MS to extract these compounds from fish samples regardless of lipid content . QuEChERS salt packet optimisation and clean up strategies such as liquid liquid extraction dispersive solid phase extraction and LipiFiltr were tested . Our results showed that EN 15662 method salts and Lipifiltr were the best combination to produce efficient analyte apparent recovery and negligible matrix effects . Limits of detection ranged from 0.05ng g

@highlight A new QuEChERS GC MS MS method for OPEs in fish has been successfully developed.
@highlight Clean up using the novel LipiFiltr greatly reduced lipidic fish matrix.
@highlight Median concentration of OPEs found at the fish species was 5.31ng g

@highlight Estimates of exposure and risk via dietary intake showed low levels of concern.
