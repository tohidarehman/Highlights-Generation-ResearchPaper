 Red wine is a complex matrix containing macromolecules such as condensed tannins and polysaccharides . Wine macromolecular components and their interactions have been reported to impact taste properties such as astringency but the colloidal systems formed in wine are not well known . A key prerequisite to characterize these systems is the ability to work under analytical conditions as close as possible to the colloid environment preserving the sample structure and limiting the denaturation of macromolecular complexes . A method of Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation coupled with UV detection multi angle light scattering and differential refractometer index has been developed to analyse macromolecules including tannins and polysaccharides and macromolecular complexes in red wine . This method separates objects according to their hydrodynamic radius and does not require calibration to determine molecular weight M

@highlight An AF4 MALS UV dRI method was developed to analyze red wine macromolecules.
@highlight A4F profiles were interpreted after injecting tannin and polysaccharide fractions.
@highlight Major fractions were attributed to higher M
@highlight polyphenols and polysaccharides.
@highlight The molecular weights of the objects present in the fractions were determined.
@highlight AF4 MALS is promising to investigate the M
@highlight distribution of tannins and macromolecules in wine matrix.
