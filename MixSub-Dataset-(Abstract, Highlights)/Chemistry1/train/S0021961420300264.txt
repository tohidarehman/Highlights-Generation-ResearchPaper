 In this study a comprehensive investigation on the volumetric properties of mixtures of a deep eutectic solvent and an alcohol was carried out . Ethaline which is one of the more common DESs and methanol were chosen to make the desired mixtures . Nine different mixture compositions of Ethaline methanol over the full range of concentrations were prepared . Densities of pure Ethaline and methanol and also nine mixture samples were measured at five temperatures from 283.15 to 323.15K and atmospheric pressure . The excess volumes of the investigated mixtures were calculated and modeled with the Redlich Kister model . All of the calculated values of excess volumes were negative which probably shows stronger hydrogen bond contributions and better interstitial accommodations in the mixtures with respect to the pure states . Furthermore other volumetric properties such as partial molar volumes and excess partial molar volumes at each composition and at infinite dilution were calculated . By analyzing the calculated volumetric properties the greater tendency of Ethaline for solvation in the mixture was observed as compared to methanol . Therefore it is suggested that probably the hydrogen bond networks in the mixture are created in a pattern in which mostly Ethaline occupies central positions being surrounded largely by methanol molecules .
