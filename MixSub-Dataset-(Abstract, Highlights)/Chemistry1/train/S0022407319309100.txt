 Independent scattering refers to situations when particles are sufficiently distant that some of the radiation characteristics of particle systems can be determined by adding the contributions of each particle . When particles are in close proximity however dependent scattering prevails and is affected by near field interactions and far field interferences among scattered waves from nearby particles . The dimensionless parameters governing the scattering cross section and asymmetry factor of non absorbing bispheres disordered and ordered suspensions and aggregates with up to 8 spherical particles were found to be the particle size parameter

@highlight Scattering by non absorbing bispheres and particle suspensions and aggregates was studied systematically.
@highlight A wide range of size parameter refractive index and interparticle distance to wavelength ratio was explored.
@highlight New transition criteria between independent dependent scattering regimes were established.
@highlight The scattering cross section and asymmetry factor feature different transition criteria.
@highlight Criteria for bispheres cannot be extended to suspensions and aggregates of small particles.
