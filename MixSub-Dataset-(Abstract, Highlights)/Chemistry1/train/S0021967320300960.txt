 One of the most important causes of the high mortality rate and low life expectancy of lung cancer is the detection at advanced stages . Thus there is an urgent need for early diagnosis and the search of new selective biomarkers . Selenium is an important constituent of selenoproteins and a powerful antioxidant able to protect against cancer . In this work the absolute quantification of selenium in selenoproteins and the total content in selenometabolites has been performed for the first time in serum from lung cancer patients and healthy controls . To this end a method for the simultaneous speciation of selenoproteins using size exclusion chromatography and affinity chromatography with detection by ICP QQQ MS and quantification by isotopic dilution was developed to determine the selenium concentration in eGPx SEPP1 and SeAlb as well as total selenometabolites to find alterations that may serve as biomarkers of this disease . In the same way a method based on anion exchange chromatography coupled to ICP QQQ MS was developed to quantify selenometabolites in the same LC and HC serum samples . The results showed that the averaged concentrations of selenium in eGPx SeAlb and selenite were significantly higher in LC patients LC eGPx 21.240.77ngg
