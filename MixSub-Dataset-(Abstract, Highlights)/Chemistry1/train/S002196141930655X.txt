 Metformin is one of the anti diabetic drugs which is widely used in the world and found abundantly in pharmaceutical wastewater . The purpose of this study the adsorption of MET from aqueous solution by Fe ZSM 5 zeolite as an adsorbent . The zeolite characterization was analyzed using FTIR FE SEM TEM XRD and N

@highlight The bifunctional Fe ZSM 5 nano adsorbent removed Metformin by adsorption.
@highlight The nano adsorbent had the high surface area and uniform morphology.
@highlight Langmuir adsorption capacity was 14.992mgg
@highlight at T 25C.
@highlight The data well fitted the Langmuir isotherm model R
@highlight  0.999 .
@highlight The developed nano adsorbent had high reusability.
