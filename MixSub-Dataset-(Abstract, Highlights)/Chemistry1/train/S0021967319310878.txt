 In spatial multi dimensional liquid chromatography devices the flow of each dimension has to remain in the corresponding region otherwise the separation efficiency is undermined . Adequate flow confinement measures are necessary . Here the use of permeability differences across different compartments of spatial two dimensional and three dimensional LC devices as a method to guide fluid flow and reduce analyte loss during the first second and third dimension development was investigated with computational fluid dynamics simulations . In case of 2DLC devices it was shown that porous barriers with a permeability on the order of 10
