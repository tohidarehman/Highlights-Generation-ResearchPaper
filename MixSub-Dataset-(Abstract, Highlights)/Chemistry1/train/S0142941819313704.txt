 Incompatibility between filler and polymer chains accompanied by particle agglomeration has a detrimental effect on the performance of mixed matrix membranes . To obviate intermolecular forces of different additives functional groups COOH NCO and NH

@highlight Functionalized fillers overcome the tendency of CNT agglomeration.
@highlight CO
@highlight permeability and permselectivity of the MMMs were enhanced simultaneously.
@highlight The plasticization resistance of P8CNT COOH decreased due to acid functionalization.
@highlight At the lower temperature and higher pressure MMMs had better permeation.
@highlight NCO as a functional group improved physiochemical properties and gas separation.
