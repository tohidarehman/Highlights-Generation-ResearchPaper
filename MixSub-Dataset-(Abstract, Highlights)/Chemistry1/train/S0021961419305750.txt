 The equilibrium solubility of saccharin in binary solvent mixtures of methanol acetonitrile ethanol acetonitrile and isopropanol acetonitrile was determined by using a gravimetric method within the temperature range from 293.15K to 323.15K at atmospheric pressure . Intriguingly the solubility exhibits a maximum value at around 0.5mol fraction of alcohols in all the solvent systems regardless of temperature . The cooperation effect between the solute solvent interaction and solvent solvent interaction was revealed by the molecular simulation study to give the explanation for the dissolving ability of saccharin in solvent mixtures . Moreover the experimental solubility data was correlated by the Jouyban Acree model vant Hoff Jouyban Acree model and Apelblat Jouyban Acree model and the Jouyban Acree model provides the best fitting performance . Furthermore the dissolution thermodynamic properties of apparent standard dissolution enthalpy Gibbs free energy and entropy were computed and the results indicate that the dissolution process of saccharin is non spontaneous endothermic and entropy driven .
