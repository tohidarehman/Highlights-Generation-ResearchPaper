 Linolenic acid and its most important positional isomer linolenic acid are essential fatty acids . Therefore ALA and GLA rich edible oils hold great potential in human and animal nutrition as well as in nutraceutics and cosmetics . Quality control and nutritional validation of oil products is thus of increasing importance . In the present study the cellulose tris based chiral stationary phase was successfully used for separation of ALA and GLA a major challenge in the liquid chromatography of these isomers . The chromatographic conditions were firstly optimized on a HPLC system with UV detection and the use of a reversed phase eluent system made up of aqueous 10mM ammonium acetate acetonitrile 40 60 v v

@highlight  and Linolenic acids ALA and GLA are involved in several metabolic processes.
@highlight ALA and GLA rich oils hold a potential as source of nutrition or in cosmetics field.
@highlight An immobilized cellulose based CSP allows the RP separation of ALA GLA.
@highlight The separation method was optimized and transferred to a LCMS MS platform.
@highlight The proposed innovative method was applied to analyze edible oils and human plasma.
