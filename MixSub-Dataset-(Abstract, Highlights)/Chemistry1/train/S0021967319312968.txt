 Several calibration approaches were evaluated for the quantitation of volatile organic compounds in air using miniaturized exhaustive and non exhaustive sampling techniques such as in tube extraction and solid phase microextraction Arrow . Eleven compounds 2 ethyl hexanol hexanal nonanal toluene ethyl benzene methyl isobutyl ketone acetophenone p cymene pinene trimethylamine and triethylamine all them found in the natural air samples were selected as model analytes . Liquid injection liquid standard addition to the sorbent bed and gas phase standards provided by an automatic permeation system were evaluated in the case of ITEX packed with laboratory made 10 polyacrylonitrile material . Two different approaches based on sampling of gas phase compounds from the permeation system and from sample vial containing gas phase standards were evaluated for SPME Arrow with two different coatings commercial divinylbenzene poly and laboratory made mesoporous Mobil Composition of Matter No . 41 . In addition interface model approach was used for the calculation of the real concentration of the target analytes in the sample from the total amount of analytes injected into the GCMS in the case of SPME Arrow . Similar results were obtained with the different approaches used for the quantitation by ITEX and SPME Arrow . However the use of gas phase standards with sample matrix similar to the natural samples allowed the permeation system to provide the most reliable results for the quantitation of the target analytes . For this approach linearity expressed as r
