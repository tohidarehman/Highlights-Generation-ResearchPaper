 Scattering of H and N atoms from W surface has been theoretically studied by means of classical trajectories based on an electronically adiabatic potential energy surface . The PES has been constructed by interpolation of density functional theory calculations following a corrugation reducing procedure . Van der Waals interactions are taken into account by using the vdW DF2 exchange correlation functional . In the dynamics a special focus is made on the influence of energy release through surface atoms motion and electrons of the metal . Most part of the H atoms sticking is mediated through penetration into the sub surface area where electron hole pairs excitation plays the major role . For N atoms the sticking is mainly due to the coupling with lattice vibrations as expected when considering heavy atoms . Adsorption and absorption processes have been characterized for both H W and N W exhibiting differences between those benchmark light and heavy atoms in interaction with metals .
