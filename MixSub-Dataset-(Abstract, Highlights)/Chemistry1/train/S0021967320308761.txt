 Excess 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine is often applied for the derivatization of aldehyde prior to the chromatographic analysis . However the residual 2 4 DNPH may cause background interference and limit the enrichment efficiency of trace aldehydes . To overcome the above bottle neck problems improve the extraction efficiency and omit the manipulation for changing the polarity of solvent for the hydrophobic analytes separation a new method combining magnetism reinforced in tube solid phase microextraction technique with non aqueous capillary electrophoresis was developed . The monolithic extraction cartridge was prepared in situ inside a capillary and doped with magnetic molecular imprinting polymers . The selective and efficient extraction of the derived analytes with simultaneous removal of the superfluous derivatization agent was achieved owing to the combined effect of molecular imprinting and magnetism reinforcement . By coupling with NACE the highly hydrophobic effluent can be analyzed directly . The LODs of the method are between 0.0032 0.0049mg L
