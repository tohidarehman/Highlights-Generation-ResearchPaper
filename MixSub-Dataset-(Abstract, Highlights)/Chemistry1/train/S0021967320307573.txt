 Columns of different structures have different potential kinetic performance the trade off between separation time and pressure . However the full potential of a structure can not always be realized in practically existing columns . Each combination of column efficiency time and pressure requires certain cross sectional dimensions of the column flow through channels . However there are limits to the narrowest flow through channels that can be manufactured with current technology . As a result columns of some structures can not be optimized for providing the required efficiency in the shortest time . Additionally the full potential of its structure can be realized only if a column can operate at the highest pressure available from liquid chromatography equipment has sufficient loadability and satisfies other practical requirements .

@highlight Structural quality factor quantifies potential column performance.
@highlight To perform at its full potential dimensions of column structure should be sufficiently small.
@highlight Several differently structured columns compared.
@highlight Required dimensions of internal structure estimated.
