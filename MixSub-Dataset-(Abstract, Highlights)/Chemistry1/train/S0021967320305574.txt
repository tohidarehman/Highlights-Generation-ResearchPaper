 We report on a comparative study of the basic separation kinetics of commercial packed bed columns and a micro pillar array column working in the 1 10L min flow rate range i.e . operating in the area of capillary flow LC . This is done using a basic test mixture of 8 alkylphenones under both isocratic and gradient separation conditions . Care was taken the PAC and the packed bed columns have similar volumes and hence also similar t

@highlight A micro pillar array column operating in the capillary flow rate range is introduced.
@highlight Performance is compared to three state of the art capillary LC packed bed columns.
@highlight Isocratic efficiency and gradient peak capacity are compared in 1 10L min range.
@highlight Fixed length kinetic plot emphasizes difference in dynamic efficiency range.
