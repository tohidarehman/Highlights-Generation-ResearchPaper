 Cyclodestrins are cyclic oligosaccharides well known for their ability to form host guest inclusion complexes with properly sized compounds . They have been used for decades as chiral selectors as well as drug delivery systems within the frameworks of separation science and pharmaceutical science . More recently their use has been extended to the field of extractive science under the stimulus of additional advantageous characteristics such as low price negligible environmental impact non toxicity as arising from the fact that natural CDs are starch degradation products . To abate their solubility in water and generate novel sorbents for solid phase extraction the following approaches have been employed
