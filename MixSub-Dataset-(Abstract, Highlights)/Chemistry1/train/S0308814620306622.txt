 The role of polyphenol oxidase in the browning of fresh wet noodle sheets was discussed . To release the chemical formation mechanism of the dark spots formed on FWNS the reconstituted FWNS and PPO catechol reaction systems were prepared . Different from the overall color change of FWNS almost all the melanins in dark spots were indirect products of PPO catalysis . The PPO catalytic dehydrogenation was an essential step for the formation of dark spots but once the phenol dehydrogenation products were formed the dark spots could still form through a further polymerization process even though the PPO was completely deactivated . The optimum pH for the phenolic dehydrogenation in FWNS was about 7 and the alkaline condition was advantageous to the progress of the polymerization . Comprehensively the maximum amount of dark spots was formed at about pH 9 .
