 In recent years covalent organic frameworks play an important role in the field of chromatographic separation . However COFs are used rarely in open tubular capillary electrochromatography so far and the reported methods have not been applied to actual sample analysis . Herein a novel azine linked COF N

@highlight This is the first time using N
@highlight  COF as stationary phase for OT CEC separation.
@highlight BPA and its analogues can be baseline separated by the N
@highlight  COF coated capillary.
@highlight The method was successfully used to determine BPA and its analogues in beverages.
