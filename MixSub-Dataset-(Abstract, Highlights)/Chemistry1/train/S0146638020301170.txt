 Closed system gold tube pyrolysis experiments were conducted on an oil sand bitumen from the Athabasca region in western Canada to investigate gas isotope variation with heating temperatures . Experiments were carried out at 350650C and a pressure of 50MPa with heating rates of 2C h and 20C h. The progressive cracking of bitumen and liquid oil lead to continuous release of methane with increasing pyrolysis temperatures while the yields of wet gas components increase initially at the lower temperature range and then decrease drastically at high temperatures . A general trend of

@highlight from biodegraded bitumen pyrolysates behavior is different from hydrocarbons.
@highlight Isotopic anomaly is caused by dynamic generation destruction and mixing processes.
