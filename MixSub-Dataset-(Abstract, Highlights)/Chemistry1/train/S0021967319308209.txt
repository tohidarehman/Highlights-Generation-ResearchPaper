 Nakai is used as a traditional Chinese medicine . However very limited information is available on its effective components . Traditional procedures for discovering natural bioactive compounds especially for minor ones are usually time consuming and labor intensive . Therefore an efficient approach using ultra high performance liquid chromatographyquadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry combined with multicomponent knockout and bioactivity evaluation was developed to obtain more information about the bioactive constituents in
