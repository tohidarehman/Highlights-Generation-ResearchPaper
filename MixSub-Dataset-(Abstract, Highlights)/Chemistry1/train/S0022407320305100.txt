 The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer has been measuring water vapor and methane in the stratosphere and mesosphere from low Earth orbit since 2004 . Recently substantial increases in water vapor in the upper atmosphere were observed with the MLS and SABER satellite instruments . The main source of water vapor in the upper atmosphere is methane oxidation . ACE FTS data show substantial water and methane increases and confirm that the methane increases are too small to explain the water increases . Therefore changes in the transport of water across the tropical tropopause layer and in atmospheric dynamics are responsible for the positive water trends .
