 Effective recovery and high purity of lipid biomarkers are essential for compound specific stable isotope analysis in a variety of fields ranging from hydrocarbon research paleoclimatology food and drug analysis and medicine . Solid phase extraction is the most common method for purifying organic compounds from complex mixtures . SPE constitutes the most labor intensive part of laboratory work often limiting the number of samples that can be analyzed . Reliable easy to use automated methods could increase sample throughput as well as reproducibility . Here we introduce such a method using a Gilson ASPEC GX 271 system and test the separation quality reproducibility and efficiency in comparison to a classical manual SPE lipid purification procedure . Using multiple extractions of the same natural soil sample we show that the automated SPE is comparable in overall quality and slightly superior in reproducibility to a manual SPE . We demonstrate that stable hydrogen isotope measurements of
