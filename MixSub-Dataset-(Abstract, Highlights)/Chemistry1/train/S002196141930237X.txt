 The compressed liquid densities of binary mixtures difluoromethane and 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoroprop 1 ene were measured using a high pressure vibrating tube densimeter over the temperatures from K and pressures up to 100MPa at five different compositions

@highlight The liquid densities of R32 R1234yf were studied over temperatures from 283 to 363 K and pressures up to 100MPa.
@highlight The experimental data were correlated with modified Tait equation.
@highlight Isothermal compressibility and isobaric thermal expansivity were calculated.
