 As a new kind of green solvents for potential replacement of traditional volatile organic compounds deep eutectic solvents have been attracting more and more attention in various applications . In this work three types of hydrophobic DESs were synthesized by simple mixing of trioctylmethyl ammonium chloride with decanoic acid ketoprofen and gemfibrozil respectively at different molar ratios . In order to evaluate the solvent characteristics of these DESs some of the physical properties such as melting point density viscosity and water contact angle were determined . Then these hydrophobic DESs were used for the vortex assisted liquid liquid microextraction of bisphenol type contaminants in water followed by quantitative determination of bisphenols contents with high performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection . For this purpose four bisphenols namely 2 2 bispropane 2 2 bis butane 4 4 bisphenol and 4 4 cyclohexylidenebisphenol were selected as model contaminants . It was found that the enrichment factors of the proposed method were in the range from 97 to 112 depending on the structure of the analytes . Under optimal experimental conditions the linearity ranges of the method varied from 0.3 to 700 g L
