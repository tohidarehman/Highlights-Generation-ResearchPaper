 Glyphosate and glufosinate are widely used herbicides around the world and their effects on human health and detection of levels have drawn increasing attention . The present study was to establish a method to determine the contents of Glyp and Gluf from corn using multi walled carbon nanotubes followed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . The corn samples were purified by MWCNTs then the analytes reacted with 9 fluorenylmethylchloroformate FMOC

@highlight Simultaneous detection of glyphosate and glufosinate.
@highlight Using multi walled carbon nanotubes as purification.
@highlight The procedures are simplified and the determination time is 4min.
@highlight The matrix effect was reduced by purification internal standard and dilution.
@highlight The analytical method has good recovery linearity precision LOD and LOQ.
