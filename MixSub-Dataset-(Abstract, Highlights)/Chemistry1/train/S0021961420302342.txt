 Thermodynamic data are the basis for design of crystallization process and control of crystal morphology and polymorph . In this work solubility data of L carnosine in different binary solvent mixtures including water were determined in temperatures ranging from 288.05K to 323.15K by static method under atmospheric pressure . It was found that the solubility data of L carnosine decrease apparently with the increasing of the mole fraction of organic solvent in binary solvent mixtures and increase with the rising of temperature . In addition the experimental solubility data were correlated and analyzed by the modified Apelblat equation the NRTL model and the JouybanAcree model to extend the applicability of the solubility data . Finally the standard dissolution thermodynamic properties including Gibbs energy entropy and enthalpy were calculated and discussed based on the experimental solubility data and Vant Hoff equation .
