 Different particle sizes in cloudy apple juice were obtained following filtration with different mesh sizes . The effects of cloud particle size on the stability nutrient content and volatile flavor of cloudy apple juice were evaluated . With increasing mesh number particle size decreased

@highlight Reduction of particle size helped to improve physical properties of juice.
@highlight Particle properties correlated to nutrition and flavour of juice significantly.
@highlight After filtration reached a certain level it had little effect on juice quality.
