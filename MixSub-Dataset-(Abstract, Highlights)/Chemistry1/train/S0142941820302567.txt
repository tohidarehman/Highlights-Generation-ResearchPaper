 The influence of dispersion procedure and nanofiller geometry on thermal and electrical properties of graphene nanoplatelet based composites has been investigated . A theoretical model based on the contacts between adjacent nanoparticles has been proposed aiming to connect thermal and electrical properties . It has been observed that GNP overlapping induces a decrease on thermal conductivity . Its effect on electrical conductivity is more complex and depends on the areas of overlap and in plane contacts . A higher type I area in comparison to type II implies an increase of electrical conductivity with overlapping whereas the opposite effect is found when type II area is higher than type I . The predicted results of the theoretical model fitted experimental measurements at different GNP contents and three roll milling processing conditions giving a better overview of the influence of GNP geometry and interactions on electrical and thermal properties of nanocomposites .

@highlight A theoretical analysis of interaction in GNP nanocomposites has been carried out.
@highlight Thermal properties are ruled by dispersion state of GNPs.
@highlight Three roll milling process has a negative effect on electrical properties.
@highlight Overlapping factor has been identified as a crucial parameter.
@highlight Thermal and electrical properties of GNP nanocomposites are connected.
