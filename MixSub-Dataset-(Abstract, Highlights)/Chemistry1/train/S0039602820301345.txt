 Featuring unique electrical behaviors pristine and hydrogenated AA stacked bilayer h BN have attracted much interest in thermoelectric applications . In this paper we aim at engineering the electronic thermal conductivity of these lattices by both

@highlight The electronic thermal conductivity ETC of the dilute charged impurity induced hydrogenated AA stacked bilayer boronitrene is examined theoretically.
@highlight The same
@highlight  type impurity infected pristine lattice illustrates a reduction of 17.55 for ETC at room temperature and the p doped impurity does not affect the ETC.
@highlight A reduction in ETC around 7.48 and 16.5 respectively in the pristine and r C L lattice infected with different
