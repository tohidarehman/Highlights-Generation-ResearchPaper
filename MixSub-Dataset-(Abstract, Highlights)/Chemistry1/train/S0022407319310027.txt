 In the wavelength region between 5540 and 6570 systematic laser spectroscopic studies of the hyperfine structure of Niobium I lines were performed detecting laser induced fluorescence signals . Possible transition wavelengths were calculated as combinations between all known energy levels . Altogether about 380 transitions could be successfully excited and their hyperfine structure could be investigated . This large manifold of lines allowed us to evaluate our results via multiple transitions between the system of upper and lower energy levels . In Part I we report on transitions between lower even parity levels between 0 and 13 515 cm
