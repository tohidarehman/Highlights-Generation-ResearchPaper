 To reach a high separation efficiency using Centrifugal Partition Chromatography the fluid dynamical behavior of the liquid liquid two phase systems must be clearly understood . The fluid dynamics namely the dispersion the coalescence and the stationary phase retention have a high impact on a separation . Especially the mobile phase dispersion influences the mass transfer during a separation . In this study the mobile phase dispersion of different aqueous organic solvent systems was characterized for ascending and descending mode via video analysis . Thereby the influence of the physical properties of the solvent systems the operating parameters and the geometry of the chamber inlet was investigated systematically using dimensional analysis . With the help of the dimensionless numbers Ohnesorge number Oh
