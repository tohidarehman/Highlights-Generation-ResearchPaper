 The metallic nanoparticle dimer is a fundamental model system for enhancing and tuning localized surface plasmon resonances . In the past it had been found that the far and near field optical properties of dimer antennas can be regulated by many parameters . In recent years the quantum mechanical effects such as nonlocal screening and electron tunneling have been achieved when the gap distance in a dimer approaches 1nm and subnanometer . In this communication both the near field enhancement and optical force in dimer are fully investigated and compared between classical and nonlocal models . Compared with classical theory we found that both the resonant wavelength and peak intensity have smaller changes in nonlocal model when geometrical or material parameters changes . Besides the extent of parameter induced spectral changes is slightly different between near field enhancement and optical force . These results make possible the quantitative analysis of nonlocal effects in surface enhanced spectroscopy nanoantennas refractive index sensing surface enhanced optical force and quantum plasmonics .

@highlight The local analogue model LAM for nonlocal effects is integrated into the generalized Mie theory GMT for simulating strongly coupled plasmonic nanoparticle dimer.
@highlight Both the near field enhancement and optical force in the dimer nanoantenna are calculated.
@highlight The influence of some geometrical and material parameters are investigated and compared between classical and nonlocal models.
