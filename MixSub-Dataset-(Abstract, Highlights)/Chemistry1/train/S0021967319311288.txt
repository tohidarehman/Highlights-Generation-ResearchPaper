 Short peptides namely di tri and tetra peptides have been proven to play an important diagnostic role in several diseases . Therefore the development of an analytical approach for their detection and identification is nowadays an important research goal . This paper describes an analytical procedure able to overcome the issues of short peptide isolation clean up and identification in plasma samples . Four different protocols were compared and tested to maximize both recovery and total number of identifications of short circulating plasma endogenous peptides . The purified peptides coming from the four different tested protocols were separated by zwitterionic hydrophilic liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry with the purpose of accomplishing an untargeted investigation based on suspect screening for short peptides in plasma . In particular the use of Phree Phospholipid removal cartridge in combination with a purification step by solid phase extraction on a graphitized carbon black sorbent allowed the identification of the largest number of amino acid sequences . The clean up procedure allowed to tackle the issue of the low abundance of such peptides and their suppression during mass spectrometric analysis . The results indicated that sample preparation is therefore fundamental for short peptide analysis in plasma samples .
