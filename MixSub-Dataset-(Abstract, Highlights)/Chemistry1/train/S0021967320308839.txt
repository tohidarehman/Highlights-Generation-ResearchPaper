 The synthesized sheet like polypyrrole nanowires were used as solid phase extraction materials followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry for the detection of traces residues of pyrethroid pesticides in human plasma . A multiresidue method was developed and verified for the determination of trace pyrethroid residues in human plasma . In this study using the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a soft template ppy nanowires with regular morphology were prepared by oxidative polymerization . Scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy X ray diffraction analysis Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy thermogravimetric analysis and other techniques were employed for characterization . Molecular dynamics analyses were used to simulate the adsorption mechanism of each pyrethroid and ppy nanowires . Based on density analysis molecular recognition analysis and binding energy the van der Waals force was considered as an important driving force for the adsorption of pyrethroids and ppy nanowires . The limits of detection of six pyrethroids were 0.0080051ng mL
