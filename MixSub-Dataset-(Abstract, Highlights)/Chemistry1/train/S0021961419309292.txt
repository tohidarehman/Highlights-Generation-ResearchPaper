 The hydrate based thermal energy storage system is one of the most effective supplemental technologies to stabilize the energy supply for renewable energies . The system is expected to solve the global energy management issues related to energy demand increase and energy supply chain . In fact this eco friendly technology requires prospective hydrate candidates for the thermal energy storage media followed by the extensive investigation of the thermophysical properties of the selected hydrates . In this study to satisfy these requirements the equilibrium temperature and the dissociation heat of tetrabutylphosphonium acrylate ionic semi clathrate hydrate were studied . It was found that the highest equilibrium temperature was 14.4C at the mass fractions from 0.37 to 0.40 . It was also found that the largest dissociation heat was kJ kg
