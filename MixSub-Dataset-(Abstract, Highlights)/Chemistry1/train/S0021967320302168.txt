 In this paper adsorption mechanism of triterpenoid saponins in reversed phase liquid chromatography and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography was proposed based on the study of the retention behavior of mogroside V as test substance . The change of peak shape of mogroside V and its influencing factors was first investigated . As the increase of sample loading a tailing peak of mogroside V was observed in MeOH

@highlight Study of retention behavior and adsorption model of mogroside V in RPLC and HILIC.
