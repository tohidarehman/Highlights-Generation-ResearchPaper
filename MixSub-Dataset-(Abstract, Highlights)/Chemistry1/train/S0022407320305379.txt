 Based on the generalized Lorenz Mie theory and the angular spectrum decomposition method we calculate the time averaged optical torque exerted on an absorptive dielectric sphere of arbitrary size illuminated by a TM polarized Airy light sheet and the negative optical torque is particularly emphasized . The influence of the transverse scale parameter
