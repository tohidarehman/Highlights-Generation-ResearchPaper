 This paper reports for the first time the coupling of a two dimensional separation technique known as orthogonal pressurised planar electrochromatography with on line UV VIS detection . It establishes the efficiency characteristic of a planar column used in OPPEC . The studies show that in OPPEC all separation steps can run successfully as non separate operation much like in HPLC and the planar column has itself good efficiency ensuring a relatively low plate height value . In its use some findings of the previously proposed theoretical model concerning optimisation of preparative separation of components with the same electrophoretic mobility are verified showing that there is a good agreement between theory and experiment .

@highlight The entire OPPEC separation process can run in a fully online operating mode.
@highlight There is good agreement between theory and experiment.
@highlight OPPEC periodic mode separates substances with equal electrophoretic mobility.
@highlight Successful micro preparative separation of a real post reaction mixture was conducted.
@highlight Advantage of OPPEC vs HPLC for productivity and eluent consumption is possible.
