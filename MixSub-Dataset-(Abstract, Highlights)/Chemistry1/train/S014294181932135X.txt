 Nanoscale cobalt containing nitrogen doped porous carbon materials were prepared by thermolysis of a zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF 67 at different temperatures and their application for ionic electro active polymer actuator was evaluated . CoNC 700 which was obtained from ZIF 67 pyrolysis at 700C exhibits specific surface area of 753.86m

@highlight Novel polymer actuator with metal containing carbon electrode derived from ZIF 67.
@highlight Influence of calcination temperature of ZIF 67 on actuating performance was studied.
@highlight Fast electron transfer in electrode benefits the high actuating performance.
