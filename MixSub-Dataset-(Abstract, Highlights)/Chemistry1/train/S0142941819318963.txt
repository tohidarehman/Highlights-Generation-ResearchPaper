 Natural fiber is often considered inadequate for high performance reinforcement of polymer matrix composites . However some natural fibers have relatively high mechanical properties with modulus close to that of high performance synthetic fibers . Since the reinforcing efficiency of a short fiber is determined not only by the fiber modulus but also by other physical properties such as the length to diameter ratio . Here it is shown for the first time that pineapple leaf fiber whose modulus is somewhat lower than that of aramid fiber can be used to reinforce natural rubber more effectively than aramid fiber . The situation was achieved by breaking down the fiber bundles into the constituent microfibers to gain very high aspect ratio . Comparisons were made at fiber contents of 2 5 and 10 parts per hundred of rubber using dynamic mechanical analysis over a range of temperature . The results reveals that at temperature below the glass transition of the matrix rubber and low fiber contents of 2 and 5 phrs aramid fiber displays slightly better reinforcement efficiency . At high temperatures of 25 and 60C and high fiber content of 10 phr pineapple leaf microfiber clearly displays higher reinforcement efficiency than does aramid fiber . Surface modification of the fiber by silane treatment provides a slight improvement in reinforcing efficiency .

@highlight Reinforcement efficiency of short pineapple leaf microfiber and aramid fiber in natural rubber are compared.
@highlight Comparison is based on low strain behaviour from dynamic mechanical analysis.
@highlight At low fiber content aramid fiber provides slightly higher reinforcing effect than does pineapple leaf microfiber.
@highlight At high fiber content pineapple leaf microfiber provides significantly higher reinforcing effect than does aramid fiber.
