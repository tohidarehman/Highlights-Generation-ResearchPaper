 The effect of cassava pulp on morphological tensile and thermal properties of a thermoplastic cassava starch poly blend was investigated . TPS PLA CP biocomposites were manufactured by melt extrusion and then converted into specimens using an injection molding . The weight fraction of PLA to TPS CP was fixed at 40 60 whereas the final CP concentration in the composites was varied in the range of 4.422.1wt . CP could act as a reinforcement for TPS PLA blend to enhance its tensile strength up to 354 and Young s modulus up to 722 when 22.1wt of CP was loaded and a nucleating agent for PLA as confirmed from the reduced T

@highlight Thermoplastic starch poly lactic acid cassava pulp TPS PLA CP composites were produced by melt extrusion.
@highlight CP could act as a reinforcement to enhance tensile strength and Young s modulus of the composites.
@highlight CP could act as a nucleating agent for PLA in the composites as confirmed from the reduced T
@highlight The composites showed a discrete phase structure when CP with lower concentration was loaded.
@highlight Co continuous phase structure was observed for the composites with higher concentration of CP.
