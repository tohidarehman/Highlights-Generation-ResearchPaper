 Mixed matrix membranes containing graphene based fillers have attracted considerable attention in the field of gas separation . In this study two types of graphene derivatives and Graphene Oxide were embedded into the poly ether block amide based MMM to investigate and compare CO

@highlight Pebax based MMMs gas transport properties were investigated using Graphene and Graphene Oxide as the fillers.
@highlight Incorporating G and GO increased the permeability of MMMs compared with neat Pebax by reducing the crystalline part of Pebax.
@highlight GO embedded MMMs showed higher CO
@highlight permeability and CO
@highlight  N
@highlight selectivity than G embedded MMMs.
@highlight The gas separation performances were surpassed Robeson upper bound by adding only 0.7wt G and 1wt GO.
