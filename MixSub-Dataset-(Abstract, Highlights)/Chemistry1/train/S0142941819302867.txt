 The temperature dependent visco hyperelastic viscoplastic behavior of poly is investigated and modeled . The proposed mathematical formulation of the visco hyperelastic element is constructed using a generalized Maxwell model consisting of non linear springs and viscous dampers in series with a viscoplastic element . The Yamashita and Kawabata strain energy function is considered for modeling the hyperelastic response of the non linear springs elements . The viscoelastic response is represented by the Prony series invoking the time temperature correspondence principle and employing the Arrhenius equation to define the shift factors . The viscoplastic flow rate is defined by a phenomenological model activated when the Frobenius norm of the deviatoric portion of the Cauchy stress exceeds the material yield stress . The material parameters are calibrated from stress relaxation and monotonic tensile tests performed at different temperatures . Model predictions showed good agreement with the experimental results .

@highlight A new visco hyperelastic viscoplastic model is developed.
@highlight The model successfully describes PVDF relaxation behavior over a large window of temperature with very good agreement with experimental data.
@highlight The PVDF is assumed to be thermorheologically simple.
@highlight The timetemperature shift factor can be described in terms of the activation energy.
