 In this study a heart cutting 2D LC method was successfully developed and optimized in order to discriminate and quantitate propranolol propranolol and its hydroxy metabolites namely the isomeric 4hydroxypropranolol 4hydroxypropranolol 5hydroxypropranolol 5hydroxypropranolol 7 hydroxypropranolol and 7hydroxypropranolol in one chromatographic run . Thereby experiments investigating chiral discrimination in ring hydroxylation of propranolol were made feasible .

@highlight Utilization of 2DLC QQQ MS MS allowed trace level determination suitable for bioanalysis.
@highlight Achiral and chiral separation of propranolol and its ring hydroxylated metabolites.
@highlight and
@highlight studies of metabolism of pharmaceutical propranolol.
@highlight Chiral shift during enzymatic conversion to propranolol metabolites.
