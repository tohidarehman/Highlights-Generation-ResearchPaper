 It is difficult to independently obtain aerosol optical parameters at the near infrared wavelength using lidar . A new high spectral resolution technology is proposed to obtain the aerosol extinction coefficient profile at 1064nm . The high spectral resolution detection method by extracting Mie scattering and suppressing CabannesBrillouin scattering is applied in the lidar at 1064nm to improve the detection signal to noise ratio . The system parameters of near infrared high spectral resolution LiDAR N
