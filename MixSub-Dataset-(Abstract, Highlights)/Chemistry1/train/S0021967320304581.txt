 Quantitative analysis of glycans released from glycoproteins using high performance liquid chromatography requires fluorescent tag labeling to enhance sensitivity and selectivity . However the methods required to remove large amounts of excess labeling reagents from the reaction mixture are time consuming . Furthermore these methods including solvent extraction and solid phase extraction often impair quantitative analysis . Here we developed an online sample cleanup procedure for HPLC analysis of 2 aminopyridine labeled glycans using a six port two way valve and two small columns one packed with a strong cation exchange resin and the other comprising ODS silica gel . AP labeled glycans delivered from an injection port were separated from excess AP by passing through an SCX column regulated to 40C . The AP labeled glycans were trapped on an ODS column to further separate them from inorganic contaminants . By changing the valve position after 2 min to connect the ODS column to an analysis column AP labeled glycans trapped in the ODS column were eluted with an acetonitrile containing eluent followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography separation on an amide column or reversed phase mode separation on a C30 column . This method was successfully used to analyze

@highlight A simple procedure was developed to remove extra 2 aminopyridine using on line SPE.
@highlight A cation exchange column was used to separate labeled glycans from excess reagents.
@highlight An ODS mini column with a 6 port valve was used to trap labeled glycans.
@highlight The method was applicable to HILIC and RP separation of glycan derivatives.
