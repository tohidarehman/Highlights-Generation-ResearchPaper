 An eco friendly linear organic diamide derivative acting as a nucleating agent was incorporated into the biodegradable poly polyester to prepare a kind of new biocompatible composite . The differential scanning calorimetry measurement of PEA showed that crystallization temperature

@highlight Biocompatible EBH with a low
@highlight significantly increases crystallization temperature and rate of biodegradable PEA.
@highlight Green benign EBH as an effective NA exhibits an excellent nucleation effect on PEA.
@highlight Slower adjustment in the C
@highlight O group of PEA in the presence of EBH indicates hydrogen bond interaction between PEA and EBH.
@highlight EBH with a low
@highlight enhances the thermal degradation temperature of PEA.
@highlight EBH tailors the enzymatic degradation process of PEA.
