 For choosing an optimal column for a particular separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography it is essential to quantitatively understand the effects of the chemical structure of hydrophobic bonded layer derived onto silica particles on the distribution equilibrium of a solute compound at the interface between the aqueous mobile phase and the packing material . However there is still a lack of understanding of the solute distribution equilibrium in RPLC separation due to the complexities of the chemistry at the interface between the mobile phase and the bonded layer . We successfully determined the distribution coefficients of various organic compounds concerning to their accumulation onto the water bonded layer interface and into the bonded layer from bulk water using surface bubble modulated liquid chromatography with octadecyl and phenyl hexyl bonded silica columns . The water phenyl hexyl bonded layer interface accumulates organic compounds much less than the water octadecyl bonded layer interface due to its lower interfacial tension and this result suggests that phenyl hexyl group orient their benzene ring facing toward water . On the other hand aromatic moiety of phenyl hexyl group enhances partitioning of the organic compounds into the bonded layer . Experimental findings in the present work demonstrated that the water bonded layer interface and the bonded layer itself have independent contributions to the solute distribution and the water phenyl hexyl bonded layer interface shows quite different solute retention selectivity from the water octadecyl bonded layer interface .
