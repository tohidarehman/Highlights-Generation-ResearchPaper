 This work describes a sensitive and rapid analytical method for trace determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cosmetic samples . The proposed method is based on stir bar sorptive dispersive microextraction . A magnetic composite made of CoFe

@highlight A sensitive analytical method to determine PAHs in cosmetic samples is presented.
@highlight Trace levels of analytes can be determined by this method.
@highlight Analytes are extracted by using SBSDME and analyzed by GC MS.
@highlight Small volumes of organic solvents and short analysis time are needed.
@highlight This work expands the potential of SBSDME to other analytes and sorbent phases.
