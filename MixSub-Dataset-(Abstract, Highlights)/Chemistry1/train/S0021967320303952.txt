 The topic in the present paper is to prepare molecularly imprinted polymer using the template molecule with low purity . For the first time a surrounding of macromolecular crowding was established to promote the formation of the complex of the template with functional monomer efficiently thus highly pure template molecule was unnecessary . In this study the MIP monolith was synthesized using low purity lactucopicrin as template in place of highly pure one and polystyrene was used as macromolecular crowding agent . 4 Vinylpyridine and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate were used as functional monomer and crosslinker respectively . Polymerization parameters including the ratio of functional monomer template various template concentrations and PS concentration on the affinity of the resulting MIP were systematically investigated . For the lactucopicrin MIP made with the purity of lactucopicrin of 92 the imprinting factor can be up to 2.2 . The resulting MIP was filled in solid phase extraction cartridge to purify lactucopicrin from the crude extract of

@highlight Crowding surrounding was suggested for preparation of MIP using template molecule with low purity.
@highlight Crowding surrounding was made up of high molecular PS.
@highlight The necessity of simultaneous use of PS was proved to prepare MIP with impure template.
@highlight The MIP made can be used in SPE to purify lactucopicrin from the crude extract.
