 The Long chain Diol Index is a palaeotemperature proxy applied to marine sediments up to Miocene in age . Recent studies have revealed that the LDI inferred temperature yields significant errors in waters 27C . This necessitates further assessment of the performance of the LDI proxy in high temperature marine regimes . For this purpose we collected 58 surface sediment samples from the tropical South China Sea where annual sea surface temperature ranges from 24C to 29C . The original LDI calibration yields temperatures 27C for these samples and the residual between the LDI inferred temperature and the measured SST increases as SST increases . This T or mis calibration is significantly correlated with the measured SST as the temperature increases above 27C . This relationship also exists in sediment trap data . We therefore re calibrated the LDI inferred temperature to generate a new relationship that can be applied to environments with SST 27C which is beyond the range of the original LDI proxy . Both the recalibrated LDI and for comparison archaeal lipid temperature proxies were applied in the high temperature SCS the improved correlation shows the LDI recalibration could be applied to palaeo records from tropical oceans .

@highlight The LDI proxy is calibrated for the tropics using South China Sea surface sediments.
@highlight LDI values are negatively correlated with SST at temperatures above 27C.
@highlight This new LDI calibration is well correlated with archaeal lipid temperature proxies.
