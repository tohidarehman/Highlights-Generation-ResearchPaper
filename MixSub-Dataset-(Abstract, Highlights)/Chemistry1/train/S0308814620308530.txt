 A previously developed direct inlet tandem mass spectrometric method for analysis of triacylglycerol regioisomers was updated and validated for operation with current instrumentation with improved sensitivity and throughput . TAG regioisomers in pooled Chinese and Finnish human milk samples two bovine milk samples and 11 infant formulas were identified and quantified . A total of 241 TAG regioisomers were identified and quantified consisting of over 60mol of all TAGs in the human milk samples . The infant formulas deviated largely from human milk in regioisomeric composition of TAGs . In the Finnish and Chinese human milks the most abundant ones were 1 3 dioleoyl 2 palmitoylglycerol and 1 linoleoyl 2 palmitoyl 3 oleoylglycerol . In the infant formulas 1 2 dioleoyl 3 palmitoylglycerol and 1 linoleoyl 2 oleoyl 3 palmitoylglycerol 1 palmitoyl 2 linoleoyl 3 oleoylglycerol were more abundant than OPO and LPO . The differences between human milk and infant formula prompt for further development of current formulas .

@highlight A direct inlet MS MS method was developed to analyze triacylglycerol regioisomers.
@highlight Method was used to analyze human milk bovine milk and commercial infant formulas.
@highlight The study revealed differences between human milk bovine milk and infant formulas.
@highlight Vegetable oil based formulas showed larger differences compared with human milk.
