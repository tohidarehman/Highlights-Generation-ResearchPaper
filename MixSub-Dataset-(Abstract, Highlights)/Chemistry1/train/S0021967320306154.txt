 Monitoring the levels of perfluorinated compounds in the environment is of vital importance owing to their sustained environmental presence extensive distribution and associated health risks . The development of cost effective and efficient sorbents for the establishment of sensitive analytical methods is critical for achieving trace level detection . In this study a graphitic carbon nitride g C

@highlight A g C
@highlight  based sorbent exfoliated by ZIF 67 in situ is fabricated for dSPE of PFCs.
@highlight The hybrid materials possess thinner layers of g C
@highlight and small crystal of ZIF 67.
@highlight The method was applied in analysis of PFCs in water samples with low MDLs.
