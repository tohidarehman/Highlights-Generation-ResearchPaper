 A method based on solid phase extraction gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography with electron capture detector was developed for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls in atmospheric deposition samples . Six indicator PCB congeners were analysed by GC ECD equipped with two micro electron capture detectors and two gas chromatographic columns while 12 PAH compounds were analysed by GC MS MS . Solid phase extraction on silica sorbent proved suitable for accumulation of PAHs and PCBs from deposited matters . The extraction procedure was based by passing the whole sample volume through a silica cartridge with dichloromethane and

@highlight Six PCB congeners and 12 PAH compounds were determined in bulk deposition samples.
@highlight Extraction on silica sorbent followed by GC ECD and GC MS MS analysis.
@highlight The deposition rates of 12PAHs up to 1069 ng m
@highlight in cold period.
@highlight There weren t significant seasonal variations in the deposition fluxes of PCBs.
@highlight First study in Croatia to produce results for PAHs and PCBs in deposition matters.
