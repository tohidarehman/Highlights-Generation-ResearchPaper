 The modification of nanocomposite coatings with fillers having unique characteristics in the polymeric matrix is a promising strategy to enhance the durability as well as to prevent the growth of microorganisms that decrease the stability of the materials . This study was conducted to evaluate the rheological and antimicrobial behavior of epoxy based nanocomposite coatings filled with nanosilica titanium oxide TiO

@highlight The rheological and antimicrobial behavior of epoxy based nanocoatings filled with nanosilica TiO
@highlight and ZnO were evaluated.
@highlight Modified Kirby Bauer antimicrobial testing was performed using

@highlight The shear stress of the nanocoating increased by the maximum of 42 .
@highlight The highest bacterial reduction 95 was found for hybrid nanocoating composed of nanosilica ZnO and TiO2.
@highlight The bioactivity was decreased significantly.
