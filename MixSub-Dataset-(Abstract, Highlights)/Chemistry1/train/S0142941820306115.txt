 Dielectric polymers with high thermal conductivity are very promising in the fields of aerospace and electronic device packaging . However composites with excellent dielectric properties usually have low thermal conductivity . It is usually to fill the polymer with thermal conductivity particles to improve the thermal conductivity but the high content of filler often reduces the mechanical properties of the polymer . In this paper the traditional insulating polymer epoxy resin was used as the matrix by covering the surface of silicon carbide with graphene to form a core shell structure and co filled with nano diamonds to achieve the preparation of high performance epoxy resin at low content . The results showed that at the filling content of 30wt the thermal conductivity of epoxy nanocomposites showed a dramatic thermal conductivity enhancement of 1263 the energy storage modulus increased by 1.1GPa and the dielectric loss remained unchanged at 50Hz . The advantages of the composite are the structural design and surface modification of the filler which not only take advantage of its inherent advantages but also improve the interface area with the epoxy matrix . The composite materials with excellent properties are expected to provide theoretical guidance for the application of high thermal conductivity dielectric materials .
