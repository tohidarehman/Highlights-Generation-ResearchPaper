 The climatologic mean and changes in cloud optical thickness of water and ice clouds in East Asia and their influence on the local radiation budget are studied quantitatively by using the Beijing Climate Center Radiative Transfer Model of BCC RAD combined with satellite observational datasets from March 2000 to February 2018 . Our results show that the annual mean COT over East Asia decreases from the southeast to the northwest and the annual mean COT of water COT

@highlight We find there indeed existed long term change trends of COT for both water and ice clouds in some sub regions over East Asia.
@highlight It is the first time to quantify both water and ice COT and their change effects on local radiative budget with satellite observational dataset in detail.
@highlight The major contribution from liquid ice cloud path and cloud effective radius changes to the COT changes are discussed too.
