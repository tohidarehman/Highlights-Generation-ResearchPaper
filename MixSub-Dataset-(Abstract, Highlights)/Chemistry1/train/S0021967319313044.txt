 Distribution coefficient data provides the analyst with a powerful set of tools for designing elemental chemical separations . While considerable Kd data exists in the literature for traditional anion and cation exchange resins a comprehensive Kd study for the majority of the periodic table has not been published to date for several newer Eichrom extraction chromatographic resins . Kd values for the sorption of 41 different of elements on TEVA TRU UTEVA and Diphonix resin were determined in this work . The power of Kd data in designing chemical separations is then demonstrated through development of separation methods for several challenging chemical separations including U Mo Te Zr Nb Mo and Cd isolation . Separation methodologies are finally applied to soil samples where the ability for each separation to perform under complex matrix conditions is evaluated .
