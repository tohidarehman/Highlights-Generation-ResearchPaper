 The creep recovery properties of different graphene doped rubber and the effect of temperature on them were studied . Doping graphene especially with the surface functional group or surface microstructure can significantly improve the creep resistance of natural rubber . The permanent creep of each composite tested under the same conditions for 20min . Graphene oxide hydrazine hydrate reduced graphene oxide and 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane grafted graphene oxide was 33 16 and 51 lower than those filled with carbon black respectively . Four parameter model and Weibull distribution function used to analyze and evaluate the creep and recovery test results of composite rubber . These curve fitting results can adequately describe the influence of different types of nanofillers on the creep and recovery properties of composite rubber . The long term creep of composites forecasted by the time temperature superposition principle . The results show that graphene doping can improve the creep resistance of the rubber . Besides graphene oxide and surface modified graphene oxide had better creep resistance than reduced graphene oxide filled natural rubber . It can see that the interfacial properties between the graphene sheet and the natural rubber matrix play an essential role in the creep and recovery properties of graphene natural rubber composites .
