 Shape memory polyurethanes have attracted much attention in the biomedical field because they can easily control the transition temperature T

@highlight We synthesized bio based isosorbide and castor oil containing biocompatible PICU.
@highlight Body temperature triggered shape memory polymers were successfully prepared.
@highlight C2C12cells cultured on PICU series showed high biocompatibility.
@highlight PICU series show shape memory property and have outstanding potential for application in intelligent biomedical devices.
