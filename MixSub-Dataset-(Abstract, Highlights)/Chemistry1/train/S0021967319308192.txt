 Table olives contain a wide range of polyphenols responsible for protective effects on health that have been associated with a lower prevalence of chronic diseases . A new method to identify and quantify these compounds in table olives by means of methanol ethanol extraction followed by LC ESI MS MS has been developed and validated . The chromatographic column Eclipse XDB C18 never used before in this kind of application provided the best results using Milli Q water with 0.025 acetic acid and acetonitrile with 5 acetone as eluents . This method allows the quantification of 17 polyphenols namely hydroxytyrosol tyrosol salidroside hydroxytyrosol acetate catechol vanillic acid caffeic acid

@highlight Fast method was developed to analyse table olives polyphenols by liquid extraction.
@highlight Polyphenols from 5 classes were determined in 9min with novel LC ESI MS MS method.
@highlight Validation results gave good recovery linearity precision and high sensitivity.
@highlight 15 phenols were found in Marfil table olives mainly hydroxytyrosol HT and tyrosol.
