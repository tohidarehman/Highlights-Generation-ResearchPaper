 Hybrid modes originating from the coupling of the Tamm and surface plasmon polaritons excited in a one dimensional resonant photonic structure are demonstrated . The structure represents a photonic crystal bounded by a nanocomposite film consisting of a transparent matrix and silver nanoparticles uniformly distributed over its volume . In comparison with structures on planar metal films the volume concentration and shape of nanoparticles are of great help in configuring the hybrid mode properties including their wavelength and splitting . Also the radiation incidence angle variation opens the possibility of fine tuning the energy spectra of the structure . We demonstrate the high sensitivity of optical sensors based on the resonant photonic structure .

@highlight The possibility of the hybrid TPP SPP modes excitation in resonant photonic crystal structure is shown.
@highlight The localization of the field at the wavelength of hybrid modes is investigated.
@highlight The possibility of controlling the spectral properties of hybrid modes by changing the volume concentration of nanoparticles and the angle of incidence of radiation on the structure is demonstrated.
@highlight The formation of hybrid modes in the case of conjugation of a photonic crystal with an anisotropic nanocomposite film is demonstrated.
@highlight A model of an optical sensor on TPP SPP modes is proposed.
