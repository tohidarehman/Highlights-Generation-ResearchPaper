 The oil water separation has made an attention due to over increased production of oily water from the industrial process and everyday routine of humans . The current work reports on preparation and characterization of High Density Polyethylene aerogel coated Natural Rubber Latex foam with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic character good sorption capacity for oil water separation application and were investigated . The HDPE aerogel and the coated NRLF material was prepared by a cooling process from a solution of HDPE in xylene solvent . The HDPE aerogel coated NRLF displayed a porous surface morphology with particle like structural features . The HDPE aerogel coated NRLF showed superhydrophobicity with static water contact angle 150 . The effect and recyclability of the HDPE aerogel coated NRLF for oil water separation was investigated using different model oil solvents to explore their repeatable application in oil spill clean up process . Modified NRLF shows an excellent mechanical property . The average modulus and average stiffness of the modified NRLF increased with the increase of the concentration of HDPE sol . The modified superhydrophobic sponge has good durability under acid and base conditions .
