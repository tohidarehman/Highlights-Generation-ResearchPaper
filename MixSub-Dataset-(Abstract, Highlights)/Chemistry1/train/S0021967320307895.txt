 In this work a cyclodextrin functional vinyl monomer was synthesized and the common moiety of five amanita toxins was used as the template for preparing molecularly imprinted polymers . Chemical calculation was used to evaluate and describe the binding interactions between the template and the functional monomer . The preparation conditions were optimized and the resultant MIPs were characterized and employed as solid phase extraction sorbents . The SPE conditions including the amount of sorbent extraction solution and eluting solution were also optimized for the enrichment of the five toxins . Using an ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection limits ranging from 0.340.42g L 0.160.33g L and 0.0350.056g kg were achieved for the five toxins in serum urine and liver samples respectively . The proposed method was further applied to the determination of the amanita toxins in suspected samples and showed great potential in the diagnosis of mushroom poisoning .
