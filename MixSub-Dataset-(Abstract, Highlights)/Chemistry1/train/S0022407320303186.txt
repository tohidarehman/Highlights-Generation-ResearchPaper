 This study retrieves and evaluates aerosol layer height during spring dust storm events observed over the Taklimakan and Gobi Desert . A novel strategy is proposed to identify single or multi layered aerosol scenarios in wide swath passive sensor images from Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aided by profiles of Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and use different sets of look up tables to retrieve ALH accordingly . The strategy combines the advantage of two independent methodsthe ability to expand three dimensional atmospheric structure using the spectral radiance matching method and the ability to estimate ALH over a long distance using the aerosol single scattering albedo and height estimation method . From 2012 to 2016 ALH during 4 severe dust storms is retrieved over the Taklimakan and Gobi Desert . Analysis shows that the average height and occurrence frequency retrieved fall in the same range with results from previous studies . Comparisons with ALH inferred from CALIOP profiles indicate that the combined ASHE SRM method has improved the overall performance . The estimated ALH correlates well

@highlight A novel strategy is proposed to retrieve aerosol layer height for single or multi layered aerosol scenarios in wide swath passive sensor images aided by profiles of CALIOP.
@highlight Aerosol layer height is retrieved during 4 spring dust storm events the average is 5.20km in the taklimakan region and 5.12km in the gobi region.
@highlight The estimated aerosol layer height correlates well 
@highlight  0.68 with values measured by CALIOP and the mean absolute difference MAD is 1.341.02km.
