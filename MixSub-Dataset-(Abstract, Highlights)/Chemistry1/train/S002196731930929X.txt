 Magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers combine nanotechnology and molecular imprinting technology to offer selective and tunable enrichment for water analysis . In this paper a selective sorbent was prepared by surface polymerization onto magnetic Fe

@highlight A pseudo template MMIP for PAHs was synthesized using RAFT polymerization.
@highlight RAFT MMIP was used for dispersive solid phase extraction of PAHs from water.
@highlight CCD and desirability function were used for simultaneous optimization of DSPE of 16 PAHs.
@highlight MMIP DSPE showed excellent selectivity for adsorption of PAHs.
@highlight MMIP DSPE was used for determination of PAHs in river water and produced water.
