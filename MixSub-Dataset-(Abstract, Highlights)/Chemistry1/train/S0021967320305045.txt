 In this work an easy and fast procedure for the selective multiresidue determination of 14 highly polar pesticides and metabolites in beverages is presented . After an initial sample dilution the extract is shaken and centrifuged further diluted and then injected directly into the LC MS MS system using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry . No clean up procedure was needed . The method was validated according to the current European guidelines for pesticide residue analysis in food and feed and linearity limits of detection and quantification matrix effects trueness and precision were assessed . For plant based milk wine and beer samples 10 11 and 12 analytes respectively out of 14 were fully validated at 10 g kg

@highlight Selective multiresidue method for direct determination of 14 highly polar pesticides.
@highlight Sample treatment was performed in four steps dilution shaking centrifugation and extra dilution before injection.
@highlight No clean up was applied for any matrix.
@highlight Limits of quantification of 0.01 mg kg
@highlight were achieved for most of the pesticides.
