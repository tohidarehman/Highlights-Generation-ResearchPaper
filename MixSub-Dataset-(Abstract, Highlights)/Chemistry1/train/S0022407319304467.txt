 Leaf chlorophyll content is an important indicator of plant physiological status photosynthetic capacity plant stress and senescence . Optical reflection measurements offer a nondestructive method for estimating LCC and have been widely used in plant science and ecological applications . Light reflected from leaves surfaces can be described by photometric and polarimetric measurements . In this study previously introduced spectral indices based on photometric measurements did not yield highly accurate estimates of LCC using multi angular measurement in the forward scattering directions . Subsequently an index derived from photometric measurements the bidirectional reflectance factor and some previously introduced spectral indices based on the degree of linear polarization were used to estimate LCC . We found that a newly proposed spectral index based on BRF and 1 DOLP allowed the convenient estimation of LCC with a high accuracy explaining more than 90 of LCC variation . The method which relates LCC to the BRF and 1 DOLP of leaves using multi angular measurements indicates that both photometric and polarimetric properties are effective for LCC estimation . This study opens the possibility for estimating LCC based on polarization reflected from leaves . One advantage of using polarization to remotely sense leaf biochemical parameter is that DOLP measurements do not need to be normalized by a reference panel as BRF measurements .

@highlight Variation of chlorophyll content changed the spectral degree of linear polarization DOLP of leaves as the photometric measurements.
@highlight Spectral indices expressed in terms of DOLP were able to estimate leaf chlorophyll content at different directions dominated by specular reflection.
@highlight The spectral DOLP and BRF indices have the potential to be used for LCC estimation under laboratory and field conditions.
