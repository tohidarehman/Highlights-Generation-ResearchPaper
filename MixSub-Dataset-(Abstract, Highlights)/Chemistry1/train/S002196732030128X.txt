 Carbohydrates are a class of important water soluble organic compounds in atmosphere . In this study a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was applied to characterize carbohydrates in aerosol particles . Since carbohydrate was a kind of compound with low response in mass spectrometry the conventional HPLC MS MS method was not sensitive enough to determine it . When acetate acid was added into mobile phase as buffer the transition of M CH

@highlight A sensitive method based on HPLC MS MS was developed to determine carbohydrates in atmosphere.
@highlight This may be the first time to attach CH
@highlight COO
@highlight to 2 Methylbutane 1 2 3 4 tretraol using HPLC MS MS.
@highlight There is no need to separate carbohydrates completely in SRM scan mode.
@highlight The LODs of carbohydrates may be the lowest in HPLC MS MS methods.
