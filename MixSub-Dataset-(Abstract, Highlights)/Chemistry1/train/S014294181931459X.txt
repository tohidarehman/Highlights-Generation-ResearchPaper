 We developed value added high strength lignocellulosic biopolymers by exploiting high lignin biomass waste of palms . Lignocellulosic biopolymers were prepared by hot pressing microfibrillated raw and alkaline pre treated date and coconut fibers and leaves powders consisting of particles in the range 140180C . The obtained biopolymers were subjected to three point bending strength water resistance structural morphology thermal stability spectroscopy and crystallinity analyses . Findings showed that raw fiber based and alkaline pretreated biopolymers exhibited bending strength water resistance and thermal stability superior to those of leaf based biopolymers . Furthermore lignocellulosic biopolymers prepared from smaller particles showed enhanced bending and thermal properties compared to those prepared from large particles . By mechanical and thermal properties the optimum results were observed for biopolymers pre treated with 1wt NaOH except for coconut leaf based biopolymers . Results were correlated to chemical composition and particle size of milled lignocellulosic biomass allowing for efficient lignin condensation .
