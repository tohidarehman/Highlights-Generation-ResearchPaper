 Based on our previous work with pseudostationary ion exchanger sweeping we use this strategy to develop a sensitive reliable and robust method for the analysis of the newly FDA approved hepatitis C antiviral drugs namely sofosbuvir daclatasvir ledipasvir and velpatasvir in their pure forms and co formulated pharmaceutical dosage forms using micellar electrokinetic chromatography as a separation method . For the first time a successful separation of all the investigated compounds was achieved in less than 8min using a basic background electrolyte composed of 25mmol L

@highlight A robust MEKC method was developed for analysis of hepatitis C antivirals.
@highlight Optimization of sample BGE composition was performed to solve adsorption problems.
@highlight With focusing methods concentration sensitivity is significantly improved.
@highlight Good validation data permit using the MEKC method in quality control laboratories.
@highlight Approaches established can be used for analysis of other basic hydrophobic analytes.
