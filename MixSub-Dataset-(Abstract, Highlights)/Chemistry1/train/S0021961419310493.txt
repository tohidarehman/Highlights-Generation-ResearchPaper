 In this work the effect of ILs functionalization of the interaction of IL with organic solutes and water at infinite dilution has been investigated . Based on the experimental activity coefficients at infinite dilution

@highlight Activity coefficients at infinite dilution in the two TCM based ionic liquids.
@highlight None
@highlight and
@highlight of the 50 solutes in the IL have been calculated.
@highlight The gas liquid partition coefficients of the solutes 
@highlight were calculated.
@highlight and
@highlight for separation problems were calculated from
@highlight and compared with data for other ILs.
