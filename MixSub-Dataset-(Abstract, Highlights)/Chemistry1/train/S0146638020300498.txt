 The Rock Eval device has been widely used to identify the type and the thermal maturity of sedimentary organic matter as well as for quantifying the total organic carbon content . Traditionally it is a screening tool to estimate the petroleum generation potential of source rocks using standardized parameters . More recently a new Rock Eval method was proposed for the investigation of the hydrocarbon content of liquid rich tight rock samples . In this study we describe a dual vacuum and on line system that was developed to recover most compounds that are thermally released during a Rock Eval Shale Play analysis . Thermally vaporized products are divided so that half is analyzed by the Rock Eval flame ionization detector while the other portion is cryogenically trapped in the on line recovery system . The trapped products can then be transferred via a vacuum line system into a sample vial for subsequent molecular and or isotopic composition analyses . The recovery vacuum line volumes were calibrated using known quantities of gas CH

@highlight Development of an on line recovery system coupled to a Rock Eval device.
@highlight For one sample Sh0 Sh1 peaks molecular and isotopic compositions are provided.
@highlight Most released compounds were recovered by the dual vacuum and on line system.
@highlight The system can be used to characterize both solid and liquid samples.
