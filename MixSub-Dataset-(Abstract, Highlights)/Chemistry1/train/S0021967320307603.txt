 Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances have been determined in waters intended for human consumption causing concern due to their potential toxic effects in humans and the environment . Drinking water is acknowledged to be one of the major routes of exposure to PFASs which has led to the implementation of regulatory guidelines for PFASs in drinking water . In this study a fast simple sensitive and cost effective method is developed for the determination of 18 PFASs in river and drinking water . The proposed method consists of directly injecting 900 L of sample into a liquid chromatograph coupled to a triple quadrupole mass analyser which involves minimal sample treatment as the sample only needs to be filtered . The method was validated in influent and effluent water from a drinking water treatment plant . Strong matrix effects were found for some of the target PFASs and matrix matched calibration curves were performed to enable accurate and precise quantification

@highlight The method developed is based on direct injection of 900 L.
@highlight Increasing the injection volume from 500 L to 900 L did not increase matrix effects.
@highlight Sub to low ngL
@highlight MQLs were achieved without the need of pre treatment of the sample.
@highlight Short chain PFASs are not removed from the drinking water treatment plant.
@highlight PFBA PFPeA PFHxS PFOS PFOA and PFHxA were the most abundant compounds.
