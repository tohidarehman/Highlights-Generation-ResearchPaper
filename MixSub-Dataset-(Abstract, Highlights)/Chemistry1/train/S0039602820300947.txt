 From Dirac semimetal to Weyl semimetal a break inversion of time inversion symmetry or inversion symmetry is required from this point of view the possibility of breaking symmetry in HgMnTe alloys is examined in a zincblende structure and the results of numerical calculations are presented in this paper . Low

@highlight The asymmetry plays crucial role in the case of the shape of the Dirac like dispersion relation in HgMnTe films.
@highlight The Weyl nodes are predicted at the surfaces of HgMnTe and interfaces in DQWs.
@highlight The strained Energy Gap together with the sharpness of the surfaces states are very promising for the applications point of view.
@highlight The kp method allow to get the energy dispersion in crossed electric and magnetic field which allow to detect the terahertz radiation.
