 Optogalvanic spectroscopy as well as laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy were applied in order to find new energy levels of atomic lanthanum . A hollow cathode lamp and a tuneable continuous wave titanium sapphire laser in the wavelength range from 750nm to 850nm were used for the measurements . Three energy levels of even parity with small values of total angular momentum quantum number
