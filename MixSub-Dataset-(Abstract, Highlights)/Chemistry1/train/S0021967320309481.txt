 A novel reversed phase hydrophilic interaction ion exchange and chiral recognition mixed mode stationary phase material was synthesized using 3 n octadecyl 1 vinylimidazolium bromide and 6 cyclodextrin tosylate as functional monomers . After identifications of intermediates and stationary phase materials using nuclear magnetic resonance analysis Fourier transform infrared spectrometer element analysis and thermogravimetric analysis the synthesized Sil VMBD material was packed into an empty column under high pressure . The mixed mode retention performance was researched by hydrophobic hydrophilic and ionic compounds . And the retention mechanism of the multi mode stationary phase was studied via changing the mobile phase composition and pH value . Moreover the enantiomers of 1 phenyl 1 propanol warfarin and styrene oxide were separated rapidly under reverse phase mode . Fast enantioseparation of ibuprofen and ketoprofen were obtained within 4 min under polar organic mode . The experimental results show that the as prepared mixed mode column possesses reversed phase hydrophilic and ion exchange interactions with various analytes and these interactions also enable the stationary phase with multi mode and chiral separation abilities .

@highlight Novel ionic liquids functionalized mixed mode stationary phase was synthesized.
