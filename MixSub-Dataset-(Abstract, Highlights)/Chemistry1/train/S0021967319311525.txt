 The interest for a better understanding of ion exchange mechanisms at the atomic level has strongly increased over the past decades . Indeed molecular level information about physico chemical mechanisms could help optimizing chromatographic processes for protein purification which are sub optimized due to the lack of predictive models . A promising approach is based on the use of Molecular Dynamics simulations to study local phenomena inside adsorbents which can then be challenged against experimental results . In this work macroscopic experimental data consisting in the ion exchange uptake of

@highlight The Steric Mass Action SMA model is used to describe single adsorption isotherms.
@highlight All atom Molecular Dynamics MD simulations are performed.
@highlight The chromatographic surface is modeled with a counter ion layer.
@highlight Four binding patches are identified to be the predominant form of adsorption.
@highlight SMA parameters from MD are in good agreement with macroscopic experiments.
