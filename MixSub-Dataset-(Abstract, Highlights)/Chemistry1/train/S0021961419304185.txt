 In order to solve the problem that potassium salt product is impure in industrial production . Phase equilibrium structural properties and separation process of potassium ammonium sulfate in aqueous solid solution was studied . First we study solid liquid equilibrium of K

@highlight Solid liquid phase equilibrium for the ternary system was investigated.
@highlight By characterization determined infinite substitutional solid solutions.
@highlight Two solid solutions are analyzed by FTIR TG DSC EDS mapping .
@highlight A multistage purification process was developed and proved feasibility for AQ SS.
