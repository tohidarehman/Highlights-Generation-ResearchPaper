 We propose a new capillary electrophoresis based open tubular immobilized enzyme microreactor and its application in acetylcholinesterase assays . The IMER is fabricated at the capillary inlet with the inner surface modified by a micropore structured layer . The use of IMER accomplishes the enzymatic reaction and separation detection of the products in the same capillary within 3min . The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated via online analysis of the activity and inhibition of AChE enzymes . Such method exhibits good reproducibility with relative standard deviation of less than 4 for 20 runs and the enzyme remains over 82 of the initial activity after usage of 7 days . The IMERs are successfully applied to detect the organophosphorus pesticide paraoxon in three types of vegetable juice samples with a limit of detection of as low as 61ngmL

@highlight Novel CE IMER is fabricated based on 3D micro porous layer open tubular column.
@highlight Enhanced enzyme loading amount due to large surface area of micro porous layer.
@highlight CE IMER exhibits excellent reproducibility and stability for enzyme assays.
@highlight Successful application of CE IMER for detecting organophosphorus pesticide.
