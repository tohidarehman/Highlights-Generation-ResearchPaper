 Sorption of PFASs onto surfaces of laboratory materials has been frequently reported . Due to the often complex and poorly understood nature of such sorption workarounds have often included use of whole samples only accompanied by sample vessel rinsing to desorb active surfaces . The resulting methods tend to require considerable sample preparation times and preclude typical activities such as aliquoting and dilution of water samples prior to extraction . This manuscript reports an approach for PFAS analysis which uses subsampling of water matrices from vessels including centrifuge tubes and autosampler vials through the optimized use of solvent to reduce PFAS retention on subsampling vessels . Online solid phase extraction using a weak anion exchange resin is then used to concentrate sample aliquots to improve sensitivity and allow for removal of matrix interferences . With the technique of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry statistically based quantitation limits ranged from sub ng L to single digit ng L for carboxylate sulfonate and sulfonamide PFASs analytes from C

@highlight Analytical bias resulting from PFAS sorption to laboratory materials did not inhibit sample throughput.
@highlight Solvent addition to samples with optimized analysis conditions minimized impacts of subsampling.
@highlight Quantitation with isotope dilution mass spectrometry met acceptance criteria for matched standards.
@highlight The results suggest analytical factors to consider for PFASs in future studies.
