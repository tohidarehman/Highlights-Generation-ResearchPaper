 Computer simulations employed in Stark broadening calculations are reexamined within the perspective of giving error bars to results . As a rule the calculated spectra exhibit a noisy structure which is inherent to the random number generators involved in the numerical method . Using a variance estimator we quantify the statistical noise on simulated line shapes . Two expressions for the radiated power spectrum which are analytically equivalent but lead to different noise levels are considered . A discussion of this difference is carried out based on an analytical model .
