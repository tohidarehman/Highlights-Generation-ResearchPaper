 The early identification of unstable glass objects in museum collections is essential for their conservation but as yet can not be accomplished straightforwardly . Accordingly this paper describes the development and validation of a simple protocol for quantitative determination of ions characteristic of the chemical decay of historic glass using surface swabbing combined with ion exchange chromatography . The establishment of a robust protocol is an important step in the development of an early warning system for the chemical deterioration of unstable glass . Using a model system the protocol was validated for specificity linearity accuracy precision limits of detection and limits of quantification for 10 anionic species and 6 cationic species . Good validation parameters R

@highlight A sampling protocol for the study of unstable historic glass was established
@highlight Ion Chromatography was used for analysis for determination of glass sickness
@highlight Good validation parameters were obtained for ions related to glass degradation
@highlight The protocol is promising for an early warning system for unstable glass in museums
