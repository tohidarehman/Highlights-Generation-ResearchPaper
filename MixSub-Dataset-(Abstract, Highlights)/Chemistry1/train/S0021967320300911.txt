 Recently ion chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry has been used for the determination of anionic metabolites . However connection with a mass spectrometer in this method is not straightforward because backpressure produced by the addition of a make up solution often affects the peak resolutions of the target metabolites . To overcome this problem we developed a capillary ion chromatography mass spectrometry method utilizing a double coaxial electrospray ionization sprayer . This method was not affected by backpressure and the number of theoretical plates was about three times that of a conventional sprayer . Under optimized conditions 44 anionic metabolites including organic acids sugar phosphates nucleotides and cofactors were successfully separated and selectively detected with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer . The calibration curves of the tested metabolites showed excellent linearity within the range of 1100 000nmol L and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.991 . The detection limits for these metabolites were between 1 and 500nmol L . The developed method was applied to the quantitation of anionic metabolites in cultured cancer cell samples with tumor necrosis factor stimulation . This allowed for the successful determination of 105 metabolites . The levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates changed significantly after TNF stimulation . These results demonstrate that the developed method is a promising new tool for comprehensive analysis of anionic metabolites .
