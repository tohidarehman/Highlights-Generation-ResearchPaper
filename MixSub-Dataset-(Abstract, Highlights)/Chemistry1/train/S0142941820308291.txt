 UHMWPE viscoelastic fibers show great interest as reinforcement within composites and especially when used in SRPs . They provide ductility lightness and recyclability benefits that glass or carbon fibers can not provide . It is therefore necessary to increase knowledge about the behavior of UHMWPE fibers . Before the thermomechanical characterization of these yarns an experimental protocol is proposed validated and it supplements the existing standard . Monotonous load unload and creep tensile tests were carried out on Doyentrontex yarns . Temperature and strain rate dependencies were observed . A time temperature superposition is used to reconstruct the evolutions of modulus at 0.5 maximum strength and strain at break at 23C over a wide range of strain rates . The behavior of the yarns studied appears to be complex . Indeed at low temperatures a hyperelastic type of behavior combined with plasticity predominates whereas a more elasto viscoplastic one emerges at 100C . From creep tests a time temperature stress level superposition leads to the reconstruction of the yarns creep behavior over a long period at the reference temperature 23C and the reference stress level which is 40 of the stress at break in tensile tests at any given test temperature .
