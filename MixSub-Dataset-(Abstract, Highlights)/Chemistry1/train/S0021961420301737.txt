 D limonene is a monoterpene naturally found in citrus peels especially lemons and oranges and is responsible for their strong odour . D Limonene has specific properties that enable its use in various industrial segments such as foods perfumes beverages cosmetics pharmaceuticals detergents soaps insecticides disinfectants fine chemicals as a biodegradable solvent and so on . Among the ways in which limonene can be used the mixture of d limonene with alcohol compounds has a great application potential since alcoholic extracts of citrus essential oils have high solubility in aqueous solutions reducing the occurrence of oxidation reactions as well as increasing the aromatic resistance of the mixture . However studies on the thermodynamic properties of alcohol compounds and terpenes mixtures are still scarce . Thus in this study the density and excess molar volume data

@highlight Excess molar volume of d limonene alcohol compounds were all positives 
@highlight Flash Point of d limonene alcohol compounds were highly non ideal 
@highlight UNIFAC provided a better description of the Flash Point behavior than Ideal model
