 Isobaric vapour liquid equilibrium data of dimethyl succinate dimethyl glutarate dimethyl adipate ternary system was measured at 2kPa 5kPa and 8kPa with a dynamic recirculating apparatus and the temperature ranged from 364.46 to 403.55K . The experimental data was correlated with NRTL Wilson and Uniquac models . The results showed that the maximum value of the root mean square deviation of the vapour phase mole fraction of the ternary system correlated by the three models is 0.0083 0.0076 and 0.0084 respectively . The vapour liquid equilibrium data of the ternary system was predicted by the interaction parameters of NRTL Wilson and the Uniquac models in the literature . The results showed that the maximum value of the root mean square deviation of the vapour phase mole fraction of the ternary system predicted by the three models is 0.0547 0.0471 and 0.0498 respectively . The deviation between the experimental value and the regression value or the predicted value was small and both met the needs of design calculation of the engineering separation . The results obtained from the regression of experimental values are significantly better .
