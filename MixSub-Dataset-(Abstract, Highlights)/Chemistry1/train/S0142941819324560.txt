 The degradation of cross linked polyethylene insulation material is critical for the safe operation of cables . While there are extensive studies on the thermo oxidative ageing of XLPE at or below 130C the maximum overload conductor operating temperature the short circuit temperature can rise above 150C and the ageing patterns at these situations have not been fully understood . Here chemical crystalline structure cross linking density as well as the mechanical properties were characterized . The results demonstrate the importance of antioxidants in the high temperature situation . Before antioxidants are completely consumed most of the mechanical and physicochemical properties remain stable . While antioxidant is depleted the thermo oxidative degradation is detrimental to the structure and properties of the insulation . The activation energy is around 160kJ mol for the thermo oxidative ageing from which the lifetime allowed before serious destruction of the insulation at different shortage or overload temperatures can be calculated .

@highlight Multiple characterizations are used to eluciate the ageing at high temperatures.
@highlight Antioxidants are critical to resist thermal ageing of cross linked polyethylene.
@highlight The activation energy of thermal ageing is 160kJ mol.
@highlight The lifetime of cable insulation in shortage situation can be predicted.
