 An untargeted LC MS MS based molecular networking method was established for the automatic determination of variants of enniatin and beauvericin from both fungal cultures and naturally contaminated samples . Using this method a large number of samples can be efficiently analyzed for the presence of enniatin and beauvericin related compounds . As proof of concept 26 cultures derived from 13 fungal strains in the genera of

@highlight We developed an MS based molecular networking method for depsipeptide detection
@highlight Our method efficiently detects enniatin and beauvericin variants in complex samples
@highlight Four enniatin and three beauvericin producing fungi were newly discovered
@highlight One new isomer of enniatin A and three new bassianolide analogues were discovered
@highlight Structures were tentatively determined by the product ions of sodium adducts
@highlight The new isomer of enniatin A was further confirmed by NMR spectra
