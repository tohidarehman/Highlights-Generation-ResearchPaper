 A tailor made porous molecularly imprinted polymer thin film was prepared by in situ photo radical polymerization on a glass slide and used as a microextraction adsorbent . Detection was carried out using gas chromatography mass spectrometry to afford a method suitable for the selective determination of trace concentrations of polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles in seawater . PASHs are one of the most problematic aromatic organic pollutants as they are considered more persistent and toxic compared to other analogous aromatic compounds in the environment . The optimized thin film consisted of a 2 thiophenecarboxaldehyde pseudo template with 1 vinylimidazole as the functional monomer bisphenol A dimethacrylate as the cross linker acetonitrile as the porogen and polyethylene glycol to boost porosity through formation of interpenetrating polymer networks . The adsorption behaviours of the thin film including adsorption kinetics binding isotherms and selectivity of MIP thin film were investigated in detail . The highest imprinting factors and adsorption capacity for targeted PASHs were achieved at a template monomer cross linker ratio of 1 4 8 . The method with no sample or film pretreatment showed very good reproducibility for the extraction of PASHs from spiked seawater samples RSDs6.0
