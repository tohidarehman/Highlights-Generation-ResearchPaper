 In this work flexible PVC formulations were prepared using biobased end capped saturated polyesters . The SPs were end capped for the first time with long alkyl chains and unbranched aiming to increase the compatibility with PVC matrix free volume and reduce migration . The properties of PVC samples plasticized with the SPs were compared with a PVC sample plasticized with dioctyl terephthalate . A significant decrease in the

@highlight End capped saturated polyesters SPs with high biobased content were developed.
@highlight End capping of SPs with alkyl moieties improves the plasticizing effect.
@highlight End capped SPs are able to be processed in the conditions used in PVC industry.
@highlight End capped SPs have a very low migration tendency.
@highlight The thermomechanical properties of plasticized PVC do not change significantly after extraction tests.
