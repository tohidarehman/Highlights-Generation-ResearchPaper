 The solidliquid equilibria of a poorly soluble drug namely dipyridamole were assayed to determine solubility in pure and binary mixtures between 273.15K and 313.15K under atmospheric pressure . The solubility profiles of dipyridamole in pure and mixed solvents were evaluated by some thermodynamic models . The maximum solubility in mole fraction was obtained in pure

@highlight Study the solubility profiles of dipyridamole in pure and mixed solvents.
@highlight KAT LSER model was applied to analyze the effect of the solutesolvent intermolecular interactions on the solubility.
@highlight The solubility profiles were correlated by two thermodynamic models.
@highlight Some thermodynamic properties of dissolution process are calculated.
