 In this study a dispersive solid phase extraction method was combined with solidification of floating organic dropliquidliquid microextraction based on in situ synthesis of deep eutectic solvent . It was used for the extraction of some phytosterols from edible oil samples . The extracted analytes were quantified by gas chromatographymass spectrometry . In this procedure the sample lipids are saponified with sodium hydroxide and then the analytes are adsorbed onto an octadecylsilane sorbent . After that the analytes are desorbed from the sorbent with ethanol as an elution solvent and the eluant is diluted with deionized water to obtain a homogenous solution . Then a few amounts of choline chloride and

@highlight DSPE combined with deep eutectic solventbased SFO DLLME has been developed.
@highlight GCMS system was used for quantification phytosterols.
@highlight The method was applied to determine phytosterols in edible oils.
@highlight Simplicity low cost less toxicity and effective sample preparation are advantages of the method.
