 An ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method based on selective accelerated solvent extraction and magnetic material purification was established to analyze the residues of various veterinary antibiotics and agricultural fungicides and insecticides in livestock and poultry excrement . Methanolacetonitrile was used as the extraction solvent and static extraction was conducted three times in 5 min . Preliminary purification was achieved by adding 0.5g acidic aluminaflorisil to the extraction cell while the extraction was conducted . This preliminarily purified extract was further purified using magnetic material then analyzed using UPLCMS MS . Under optimal conditions 33 types of antibiotics including 3 amphenicols 8 macrolides 17 sulfonamides and 5 nitroimidazoles as well as 37 types of pesticides including 27 insecticides and 10 fungicides were detected . Recoveries ranged from 60.3 to 110.0 at three spiked concentrations the detection limits ranged from 0.2 to 3.5g kg and the quantitative limits ranged from 0.5 to 11.5g kg . This newly established method was tested using 30 livestock and poultry excrement samples and confirmed its use for determining veterinary drugs and pesticides in practical samples .
