 A method to thermodynamically model the alkane isovolatility curves of a comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography separation is presented . This method omits all instrument modifications additional chromatogram collection or method alterations which typical isovolatility curve generation requires . Provided that the thermodynamic indices of reference alkanes are available chromatographers only need to specify the GCGC method parameters of their separation to output the isovolatility curves . The curves can then be used alongside reference retention indices to generate two dimensional retention times for each analyte . Agreement between the modeled and experimental retention times provides a secondary mechanism for compound identification supporting the results of a mass spectral search . The technique was used to model the retention times of a GCGC separation of aromatic hydrocarbons achieving an average first dimension retention time modeling error of 11s and an average second dimension retention time modeling error of 0.09s . Retention indices modeled retention times provide a simpler analyte identification procedure compared to conventional two dimensional retention indices matching .
