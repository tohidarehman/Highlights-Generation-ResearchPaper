 Acetic acid is a common pollutant for which photocatalytic degradation over titania provides a mitigating strategy . Knowledge of the bonding of acetate acetic acid to this substrate is needed to aid interpretation of the photocatalytic data . In this work we use ambient pressure near edge X ray absorption fine structure to measure the coverage and geometry of acetate in the TiO

@highlight The use of a novel technique ambient pressure NEXAFS to determine the orientation of second layer molecular acetic acid bonded to dissociated acetic acid in the contact layer.
