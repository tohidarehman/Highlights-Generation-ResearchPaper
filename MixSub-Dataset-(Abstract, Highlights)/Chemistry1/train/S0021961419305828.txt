 Due to the wide application of systems based on germanium ternary Bi Ga Ge and Bi Ge Zn systems were experimentally tested in this study . Used experimental techniques were scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy x ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis . Three groups of samples were prepared and tested . Alloys were from two isothermal sections at 100 and 300C and three vertical sections . Obtained results of experimental tests were compared with predicted phase diagrams . Comparison of EDS and DTA results with calculated phase diagrams of the ternary Bi Ga Ge system results in good agreement . While for Bi Ge Zn was necessary to introduce new ternary parameters . Introduced ternary parameters were based on experimental results from this study . The thermodynamic descriptions of the ternary Bi Ga Ge and Bi Ge Zn systems have been developed by using CALPHAD method . Reasonable agreement between experimental data and the calculated phase diagrams has been reached for both ternary Bi Ga Ge and Bi Ge Zn systems . The liquid projection and invariant equilibria have been calculated by using obtained thermodynamic parameters .
