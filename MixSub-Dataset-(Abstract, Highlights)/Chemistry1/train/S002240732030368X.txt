 A plane electromagnetic wave amplitude and frequency modulated as a linear chirp is incident on a dielectric sphere that hosts an eccentric spherical pec inclusion . This radiation problem is solved in the frequency domain by use of symmetry dependent spherical eigenvectors the end result being a set of linear equations for the wave amplitudes of the frequency spectrum of the electric field in every part of space . That set is solved by truncation and matrix inversion separately for even and odd symmetry wave amplitudes . The backscattered chirp is found by an inverse Fourier transform that yields the time dependent monostatic radar cross section . A numerical application manifests the possibility to detect a pec sphere concealed in an acrylic sphere by use of a wide band chirp that targets a morphology dependent resonance of the composite body . Our theory and code are validated by use of a commercial software .

@highlight The radiation problem is solved in the frequency domain by use of symmetry dependent spherical eigenvectors and indirect mode matching equations.
@highlight The time domain backscattered chirp is obtained by use of the Fourier transform.
@highlight The envelope of the backscattered chirp acquires the shape of the morphology dependent resonance targeted by the incident chirp.
@highlight The numerical example indicates that a metallic inclusion placed anywhere within the host can be detected by proper design of the incident chirp.
