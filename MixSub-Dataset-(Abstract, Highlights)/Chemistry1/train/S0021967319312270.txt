 Natural products including alkaloids are important resources for new drugs . However in today s high throughput screening environment natural product drug discovery programs are challenged for their low efficiency . In order to adapt to current HTS models we here developed a rapid sample saving and miniaturized paradigm that seamlessly integrated alkaloid micro fractionation quantitative analysis qualitative analysis and phenotypic screening . In the work alkaloid samples were analyzed and fractionated on an analytical charged C18 column and fraction qualities were determined by a charged aerosol detector . Fraction activities on dopamine D2 receptor were screened by cellular dynamic mass redistribution assay and active fractions were further characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry . The whole workflow was first validated by mixed standard for accuracy and then by 300 g of
