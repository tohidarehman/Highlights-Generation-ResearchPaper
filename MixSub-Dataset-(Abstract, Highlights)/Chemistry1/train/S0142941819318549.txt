 With the dwindling of petroleum resources worldwide there is an immediate need for a renewable environment friendly cost effective and sustainable bio resource in the textile industry . Here we report a dual crosslinked fiber derived from renewable biopolymers . In this study keratin was extracted from bio waste of chicken feathers with a thiol content of 0.172mM . The extracted keratin was used to prepare dope with alginate at different ratios and N N ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride via amide linkages . The formation of covalently crosslinked dope was evidenced from FTIR and ninhydrin assay . The dope was then extruded in calcium bath to produce fibers with uniform diameter wherein the calcium ions were used to ionically crosslink the covalently crosslinked dope . The resulting dual crosslinked fibers were characterized in terms of chemical composition surface morphology mechanical properties thermal degradation and swelling . The strength modulus and toughness of the dual crosslinked fibers were substantially improved by 27 20 and 33 respectively than that of control alginate fiber . The gravimetric toughness of the optimised dual crosslinked fiber 724Jg
