 Equilibrium swelling measurement and software program were employed to investigate the effect of crosslink density on the swelling responses and three dimensional solubility parameters of the cured SBR samples . The swelling responses change evidently with increased crosslink densities which however have no influence on the HSP values of SBR . In order to study the application of HSP in predicting interactions between rubbers and additives a set of new Flory Huggins interaction parameters

@highlight The effect of crosslink density on swelling responses and solubility parameters have been investigated systematically.
@highlight The change of swelling responses with crosslink density has been determined quantitatively.
@highlight New Flory Huggins interaction parameter 
@highlight  has been calculated with HSP values.
@highlight The relationship of correlation index and
@highlight value has been established by considering crosslink density.
@highlight The pre screening work of potential additives for formula design becomes more conveniently now.
