 The viscoelastic behavior of multiwall carbon nanotube reinforced polyamide 66 was evaluated to investigate the effect of CNT content and loading frequency on dynamic moduli and damping factor tan

@highlight Injection molding is an effective approach for manufacturing well dispersed nanocomposites.
@highlight PA 66 CNT disk samples with five different CNT contents ranging from 3wt to 15wt were manufactured.
@highlight Nanocomposites with CNT content as high as 15wt shows improved storage modulus without saturation.
@highlight The variability in loss modulus is much higher than the variability in storage modulus.
