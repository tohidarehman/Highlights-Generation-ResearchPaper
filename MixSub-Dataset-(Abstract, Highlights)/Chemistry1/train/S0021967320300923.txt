 Considering the huge difference of biological toxicity it is extremely significant to recognize the exact content of arsenic species in actual samples . In this paper a novel pretreatment technique for the efficient extraction of arsenic species from herbal samples is developed by dual frequency ultrasound assisted enzymatic digestion . The preservation of arsenic original form reduction of the actual analysis time environmental friendliness and free interference in subsequent detection make this method over the traditional method such as wet digestion ashing and some solvent extraction technologies . The combination of DUED and atomic fluorescence spectrometry realize the speciation analysis of arsenic in traditional Chinese medicine . The optimizations of experimental parameters have been achieved and the potential mechanism is discussed . The experimental data showed that cellulase is suitable for the digestion of herbal matrix than amylase and papain . Ultrasound can significantly increase the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of biological molecules especially under dual frequency ultrasound irradiation . The highest relative extraction efficiency can be obtained by combining 40kHz ultrasonic bath with 20kHz ultrasonic probe . Two certified reference materials 090066 and GBW090067 and four practical herbs were used to evaluate the accuracy and practicability of the method . Inorganic arsenic including trivalent arsenic and pentavalent arsenic was the main species in the four herbal samples .

@highlight Dual frequency ultrasound assisted enzyme extraction technology can effectively extract and maintain the initial form of arsenic.
@highlight Cellulase is more suitable for extracting arsenic species from herbal matrix samples.
@highlight The application of dual frequency ultrasound can shorten the sample processing time to 6min.
