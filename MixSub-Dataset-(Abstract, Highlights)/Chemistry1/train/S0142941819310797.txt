 Silica fume is silica rich amorphous waste by product obtained during zirconium silicate electrofusion process . The key objective of the study was to determine the efficiency of SF as a reinforcing filler in Natural Rubber compounds vis a vis the conventional filler high abrasion furnace black . Inter particle distance and particle size distribution analysis from Transmission Electron Microscopy exhibited homogeneous dispersion of filler in hybrid composite with Bispropyl tetrasulfide . NR composite with 20 phr SF loading improved modulus by 107 tensile strength by 12 and tear strength by 28 over gum NR . Hybrid composite showed 111 increase in modulus than NR SF20 composite . Theoretical modelling of Young s modulus with volume fraction of filler quite fit with Guth Gold equation . Hybrid composite with TESPT showed 72 reduction in heat build up compared to NR HAF50 composite . Thermal stability improved by 6C and rolling resistance reduced by 64 for hybrid TESPT composite compared to NR HAF50 composite . Constrained region in NR composites obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis showed improved rubber filler interaction in hybrid TESPT composite . Hence this work not only provides a new approach to utilize industrial waste but also provides for a high performance NR composite at low cost .
