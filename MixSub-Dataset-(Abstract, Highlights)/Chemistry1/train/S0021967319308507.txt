 In this work the suitability of gas chromatography mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for the multi class determination of different families of neutral per and polyfluoroalkyl substances such as fluorotelomer olefins alcohols and fluorooctanesulfonamides and sulfonamido ethanols was investigated and compared . Regarding GCMS the use of a semi polar GC column allowed the adequate separation of all the compounds while chemical ionisation of positive ions as ionisation technique provided the best responses . Concerning UHPLCMS MS atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation and photoionisation sources allowed the ionisation of all studied neutral PFASs including FTOs for the first time . High vaporizer temperatures and acetonitrile water mobile phase mixtures were required to favour the ionisation of FTOs with adequate ionisation for FTOHs FOSAs and FOSEs . The chromatographic separation performed on a totally porous column allowed the successful separation of the four families of neutral PFASs . After comparing the performance of the studied methods the highest detectability was achieved using UHPLCAPCIMS MS and it was chosen in combination with a solid phase extraction procedure for the analysis of neutral PFASs in water samples . The whole method provided low limits of detection 0.0036gL

@highlight CI and a semi polar column provided the best GCMS conditions for all the compounds.
@highlight Negative ion APCI provided the lowest LODs for the target compounds by LCMS.
@highlight For the first time FTOs were ionised by atmospheric pressure ionisation sources.
@highlight UHPLCAPCIMS MS method allowed the multi class determination of neutral PFASs.
@highlight The presence of neutral PFASs in river waters remains constant through the time.
