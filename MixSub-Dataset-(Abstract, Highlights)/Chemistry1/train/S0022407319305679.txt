 The absorption cross sections as important spectroscopic data can be used for the identification and quantitative measurement of components . However in view that carbon monosulfide is unstable and highly reactive it is difficult to measure the absorption cross sections of CS . Therefore a method for measuring absorption cross sections of CS based on the dynamic equilibrium between carbon disulfide CS

@highlight A method for measuring absorption cross sections of unstable CS is proposed.
@highlight The experimental device for measuring the CS concentration is designed.
@highlight Different concentrations of CS are obtained by the photolysis of CS
@highlight The absorption cross sections of CS are provided for the first time.
