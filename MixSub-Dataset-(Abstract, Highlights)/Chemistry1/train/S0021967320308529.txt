 A new sample preparation method was developed for auxin like herbicide clopyralid residue in agricultural products . The method uses extraction with sulfuric acid acidified acetonitrile with cleanup of sample extracts using solid phase extraction and micro liquidliquid extraction followed by ultraperformance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry . This sample preparation method greatly reduces the influence on ionization during determination with UPLCMS MS. Quantification was achieved using external calibrators prepared in matrix free 0.1 formic acid . The proposed analytical method supported good recovery of 73.791.4 with less than 8 relative standard deviation . Method quantification limits of samples were 0.61.0 ng g

@highlight We developed a sample preparation method to analyze clopyralid in crop samples.
@highlight Micro liquidliquid extraction was used effectively for sample extract cleanup.
@highlight No matrix effect was found to interfere with the analysis of clopyralid.
@highlight The proposed analytical method showed good recovery accuracy and sensitivity.
