 The origins of hydrocarbons occurring in oil bearing fluid inclusions have been studied in detail over the last four decades but very little is known about co occurring nitrogen sulfur and oxygen containing compounds . Here we outline a new method for gathering valuable information on NSO compounds using the Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry in combination with Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization in positive ion mode and Electrospray Ionization in negative ion mode . A key element was to develop a rigorous acid free cleaning protocol to make oil inclusions from a broad range of host materials accessible to the very sensitive FT ICR MS technique . Although oil contamination from surrounding organic matter could not be entirely eliminated the procedure enables distinction of external contaminants and identification of affected NSO compound classes allowing a conditional interpretation of the FT results of FI samples especially for compounds measured in the APPI mode . First insights into the high molecular weight hydrocarbons and NSO compounds in FI oils are presented here using examples from Germany Tunisia Pakistan and Mexico .
