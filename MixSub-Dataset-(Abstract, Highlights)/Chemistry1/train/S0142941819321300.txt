 A polysulfone based membrane with a specific structure is developed by simultaneous combination of PVP K90 as a hydrophilic high molecular weight polymer together with water as strong and glycerol as weak non solvent additives in order to separate low density lipoprotein from blood plasma . Molecular weight cut off and molecular weight retention onset of membranes were evaluated and found that membranes with 1.1
