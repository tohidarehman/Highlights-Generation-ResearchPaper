 A novel ultra light superhydrophobic graphene based carrageenan sponge absorbent was synthesized by one pot hydrothermal method for the use of selective adsorption of oils and organic solvents from their water mixtures . The GO nanosheets were reacted in the presence of formaldehyde by the insertion of carrageenan forming hydrophobic cross linked structure in between them . The structure and properties of this GCS are well characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy X ray diffraction Thermal gravimetric analysis Scanning electron microscopy and Water contact angle . The as prepared GCS has good thermal stability low density 20 mg cm

@highlight Novel effective eco friendly GCS prepared by cross linked of carrageenan and graphene for recovery of oil and organic solvent.
@highlight GCS was characterized by using water contact angle FT IR XRD TGA and SEM.
@highlight GCS has good thermal stability low density and excellent hydrophobicity WCA is 136.24
@highlight GCS has excellent oil sorption capacity in the range of 2650 g of oil per gram of adsorbent.
