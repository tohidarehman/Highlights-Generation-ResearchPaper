 A selective and highly sensitive high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence derivatization method was developed for determination of ethinyl estradiol one of endocrine disrupting compounds . The fluorescence derivatization procedure was based on Sonogashira coupling reaction using 4 4 5 diphenyl 1

@highlight DIB I was used for selective derivatization of EE
@highlight Sonogashira coupling reaction.
@highlight Various experimental parameters were examined after that the fluorescent product was separated using HPLC FL system.
@highlight The method is selective precise robust and sensitive LOD 7.4 ng L
@highlight  and it was applied to monitor EE in river water samples.
