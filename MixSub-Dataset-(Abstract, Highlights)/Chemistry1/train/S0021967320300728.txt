 Baseline separation and analysis of multicomponent mixtures of closely related pharmaceuticals using single column selectivity can often be challenging requiring the combination of orthogonal stationary and mobile phase methods to monitor all the species and optimize reaction outcomes . In recent years two dimensional liquid chromatography has become a valuable tool for improving peak capacity and selectivity . Though powerful standard 2D LC instrumentation and software can often lead to tedious method development and has a requirement for very specific expertise that is poorly suited for a fast paced industrial environment . In this regard the introduction of an automated online 2D LC setup that could screen multiple columns in both dimensions without manual intervention will undeniably serve to streamline column mobile phase selection and secure the viability of 2D LC as a mainstay instrument for industrial applications . Herein we introduce and investigate a multicolumn online 2D LC approach that simplifies column screening and method development dramatically . This setup incorporates 6 position column selection valve technology whose functionality enables us to combine multiple columns in the first and second dimensions . This strategy in conjunction with diode array detection in both dimensions and mass spectrometry acquisition in the second dimension serves to explore different columns and mobile phases as a framework for screening targeted compounds in multicomponent mixtures without having to perform chromatographic purification . Multiple online heart cutting achiral RPLC achiral RPLC and achiral RPLC chiral RPLC coupled to DAD and ESI MS methods combining several stationary phase selectivity in an automated fashion are successfully applied to the separation and analysis of complex mixtures of drug substances where in many instances traditional 1D ultra high performance liquid chromatography fails or delivers sub optimal results . This automated online multicolumn 2D LC workflow enables rapid and efficient identification of column eluent combinations as well as sample analysis across multiple columns in both dimensions overnight with a single click .
