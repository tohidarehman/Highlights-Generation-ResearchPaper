 A thin layer of un cured resin over metal substrates applied by using an acetone diluted resin solution has been found to be beneficial to strong adhesive bonding . The resin pre coating solution can effectively seal sub surface micro cavities and increase the substrate wettability . This study examines possible aftermath effects of the acetone dilution on mechanical properties of epoxy through comparison of samples made from as received resin and resins diluted once and twice by acetone . RPC can be accepted with confidence in substrate pre treatments for strong adhesive bonding if no detrimental effect on epoxy properties is observed . Fourier transform infrared spectrum was conducted showing the spectrogram of the resin previously diluted by acetone was the same as that of as received resin i.e . no change in epoxy molecular structures after complete evaporation of acetone . Strength and modulus of elasticity measured by flexural and compressive tests were compared using samples made from as received resin and resins diluted once and twice by acetone . Variations among results from the three groups were less than 2 or negligible affirming the RPC method can be used for substrate pre treatments and stronger adhesive bonding .
