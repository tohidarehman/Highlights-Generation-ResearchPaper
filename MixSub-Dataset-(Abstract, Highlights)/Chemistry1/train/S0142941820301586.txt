 Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death . Damaged heart muscle is the etiology of heart failure . Heart failure is the most frequent cause of hospital and emergency room admissions . As a differentiated organ current therapeutics and techniques can not repair or replace the damaged myocardial tissue . Myocardial tissue engineering is one of the promising treatment modalities for repairing damaged heart tissue in patients with heart failure . In this work random Polylactic acid Polylactic acid Polyethylene glycol and random and aligned Polylactic acid Polyethylene glycol Collagen nanofiber patches were successfully produced by the electrospinning technique .

@highlight The PLA PEG Collagen nanofiber patches were produced successfully by using electrospinning method.
@highlight The high speed of the collector affected the nanofiber orientation by changing from random to aligned structures.
@highlight The high amount of PEG had a toxic effect on the cardiomyocyte cell line H9C2 .
@highlight Aligned nanofiber patches showed superior tensile strength value compared to the random nanofiber.
@highlight The effect of aligned structure on cardiomyocyte cell behavior observed efficiently.
