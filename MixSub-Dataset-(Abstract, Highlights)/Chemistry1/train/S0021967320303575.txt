 We present high resolution fast cost effective and sensitive Capillary zone electrophoresis methods for determination of enantiomeric compounds of Kynurenine pathway i.e . D L Kynurenine in human serum and urine samples by cationic CD and its synergistic dual chiral selector system with CD in 50 mM borax borate buffer as BGE . Acid mediated stacking enrichment by HCl delivered 15 nM limit of detection and 50 nM limit of quantification . The methods gave advantages of linearity in the concentration range of 50 nM 1000 nM reproducibility selectivity against interfering amino acids and remarkable recoveries . SD CSs delivered resolution of D L KYN twice that of individual chiral selectors under similar conditions . The binding constants
