 Iron oxides used as food colorants are listed in the European Union with the number E172 . However there are no specifications concerning the fraction of nanoparticles in these pigments .

@highlight In E172 pigments nanoparticles were detectable by SAXS and TEM.
@highlight Nanoparticle number exceeded 50 for six of seven pigments.
@highlight Pigments are not toxic to human intestinal cells
@highlight Black pigments were challenging due to magnetic properties and agglomeration.
