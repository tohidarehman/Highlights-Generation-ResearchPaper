 The high cost of protein A resins drives the biopharmaceutical industry to maximize its lifetime which is limited by several processes usually referred to as resin aging . In this work two model based strategies are presented aiming to control and improve the resin lifetime . The first approach purely statistical enables qualitative monitoring of the column state and prediction of column performance indicators from chromatographic on line data . The second one referred to as hybrid modeling is based on a lumped kinetic model which includes two aging parameters fitted on several resin cycling experimental campaigns with varying cleaning procedures . The first aging parameter accounts for binding capacity deterioration while the second accounts for a decreased mass transfer rate . The hybrid model provides important insights into the prevailing aging mechanism as a function of the different CPs . In addition it can be applied to model based CP optimization and yield forecasting with the capability of state estimation corrections based on on line process information . Both approaches show promising results which could help to significantly extend the resin lifetime . This comes along with increased understanding reduced experimental effort decreased cost of goods and improved process robustness .
