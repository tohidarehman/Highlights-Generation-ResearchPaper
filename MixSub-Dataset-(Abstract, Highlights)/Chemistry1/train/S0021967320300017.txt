 Aging refers to the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species that damages proteins DNA and lipids . As alterations in lipid metabolism may trigger metabolic disorders and the onset of metabolic diseases changes in lipid profiles can be closely related to aging . In this study a comprehensive lipidomic comparison between 4 and 25 month old mice was performed to investigate age induced changes in the lipid profiles of mouse serum kidney and heart using nanoflow ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry . Quantitative analysis of 279 of the 542 identified lipids revealed significant changes upon aging mainly showing decreased levels in the three types of samples . Exceptionally most triacylglycerols showed significant increases in heart tissue . The kidney was influenced more by aging than the serum and heart . The highly abundant lipids in each lipid class with significant decreases 2 fold

@highlight Nanoflow UHPLC ESI MS MS of lipids in serum heart and kidney of aged mice.
@highlight Most lipids with significant changes upon aging were decreased except TG in heart.
@highlight Lipids in kidney were influenced more by aging than those in heart and serum.
@highlight Most phosphatidylethanolamines and cardiolipins were reduced in kidney upon aging.
