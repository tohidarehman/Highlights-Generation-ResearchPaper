 Gelatin which is a soluble natural polymer produced by partial hydrolysis of collagens has been extensively used in food and pharmaceuticals . Donkey hide gelatin is a well known traditional Chinese medicine . The certification of donkey hide gelatin is one of the most concerned issues for consumers . Currently the source identification of the homologous family species including donkey horse and their hybrids remains a major challenge . Here three peptides of the equine family species were screened using high resolution LC MS . The combination of these three peptides has been used as a high performance marker in LC MS MS to identify the animal source of donkey hide gelatin containing products . Horse hide gelatin and hybrid hide gelatin can be detected in gelatin based products even at very low percentages . The marker peptide combination method is useful for source identification of homologous family species and is not only highly sensitive but also rapid .
