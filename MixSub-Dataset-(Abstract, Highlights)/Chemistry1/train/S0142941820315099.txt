 The strength and durability of adhesive joints in different applications is of special concern where aging can significantly influence the joint permanence . Aging of adhesive joints is very crucial in industries where the joints are exposed to variable environmental conditions during their life . Due to the aging the mechanical properties of the adhesive layer interfacial bonding properties and substrates mechanical performance change . In real applications the aging conditions is cyclic where the joints frequently experience aging and drying conditions . This article investigates the mechanical behavior and water absorption properties of an epoxy based adhesive in bulk form subjected to cyclic aging conditions . The effect of cyclic aging on different parameters such as the rate of moisture absorption and desorption stress strain curve glass transition temperature

@highlight Moisture diffusion was investigated for an epoxy adhesive exposed to cyclic aging.
@highlight Diffusion constant and maximum moisture content of epoxy increased during cyclic aging.
@highlight During absorption periods the elastic modulus and tensile strength of epoxy decreased.
@highlight Elastic modulus and tensile strength increased with time while drying the epoxy adhesive.
@highlight The amount of
@highlight measured at the end of cycles decreased with the number of aging cycles.
