 Using high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy we investigate the periodicity of mixed arrays of single and triple steps and the atomic structure of triple steps on three vicinal Si samples with off angles 1.5

@highlight Vicinal Si 111 surfaces investigated by STM prior and after Ge deposition.
@highlight On clean Si 111 the period of triple steps is measured by a statistical analysis.
@highlight Triple steps on 556 and 557 surfaces dont change appreciably with vicinality.
@highlight Ge epitaxy on vicinal Si 111 surfaces is strongly correlated to step morphology.
@highlight Stress driven bunching typical of Si 001 is observed on 9.45off Si 111 surface.
