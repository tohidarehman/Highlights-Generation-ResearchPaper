 Additives are added to polymers in small concentration to achieve desired application properties widely used to tailor the properties . The rapid diversification of their molecular structures with often only minute differences necessitates the development of adequate chromatographic techniques . While modified silica so far is the workhorse as stationary phase we have probed the potential of porous graphitic carbon Hypercarb

@highlight Porous graphitic carbon Hypercarb
@highlight  enables LC separation of polymer stabilizers.
@highlight Raman spectroscopy exhibits shifts of the graphite band caused by adsorption.
@highlight Argon physisorption provides proof for adsorption of polymer additives.
@highlight Adsorption reduces the specific surface area of Hypercarb
