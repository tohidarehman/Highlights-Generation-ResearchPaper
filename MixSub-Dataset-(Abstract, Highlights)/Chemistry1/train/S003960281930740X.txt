 NiAl surfaces frequently serve as a platform for studying a broad range of physical and chemical phenomena including chemisorption catalysis oxidation alloy growth and surface nanostructure formation . Knowledge of precise values for low index surface energies of NiAl the most fundamental quantities characterizing surface thermodynamics is often invaluable for understanding of these phenomena . In all previous analyses for NiAl and NiAl Ni and Al terminations are not distinguished and half of the cleavage energy is always identified as the surface energy . No values are available for individual surface energies of Ni or Al terminated NiAl or NiAl surfaces whereas knowledge of only cleavage energy is often insufficient for analyzing surface associated behavior . In this work we perform extensive first principles density functional theory calculations for surface energies and cleavage energies of NiAl NiAl and NiAl by considering the chemical potential based formulations to clarify the ambiguity in their surface energies and cleavage energies . We obtain a surface energy phase diagram for these three low index surfaces versus the relevant chemical potential as well as the chemical potential dependent Wulff plots for NiAl crystal equilibrium shapes . We also provide the surface relaxation information from our DFT calculations for comparison with previous experimental data .
