 In the present study with the aim to discover the governing interactions in binary mixtures containing diisopropyl ether and short range 2 alkanol experimental values of density and viscosity at temperature range 293.15K323.15K were reported . From these data values of excess molar volume partial molar volume and viscosity deviation for mentioned systems were calculated . Findings show that strong interactions occur among unlike molecules while increasing in the carbon chain length of 2 alkanol reinforces the interactions . Also the perturbed chain SAFT equation of state was implemented to study the density and partial molar volume of binary mixtures . Combination of this model with Free Volume Theory was applied for prediction of binary viscosities . Maximum deviation in AAD for density correlation regarding PC SAFT model was 1.21 and for viscosity calculation was 2.19 .

@highlight Molecular interactions in binary mixtures increase with alcohols chain length.
@highlight PC SAFT model can correctly calculate the densities and partial molar volumes of binaries.
@highlight FV Theory coupled with PC SAFT can correlate and predict binary viscosities with reasonable agreement.
