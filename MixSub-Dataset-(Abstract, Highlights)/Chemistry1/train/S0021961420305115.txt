 The present research work proposed the mole fraction solubility and mixing thermodynamic properties of piperonylonitrile in different binary solvent mixtures such as ethanol at

@highlight Solubility of piperonylonitrile was measured by laser monitoring method.
@highlight The miscibility of piperonylonitrile in mixed solvents was revealed by Hansen solubility parameter.
@highlight Experimental solubility was regressed and analyzed by four thermodynamic models.
@highlight Mixing thermodynamic properties of piperonylonitrile were got by Wilson model.
