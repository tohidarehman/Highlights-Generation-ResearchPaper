 A rapid and economic integrated solid phase extraction method with ionic liquid thiol graphene oxide composite as a new adsorbent was established for the extraction of fipronil in chicken eggs . In this study ISPE a new form of solid phase extraction which combined the advantages of pipette tip solid phase extraction and dispersive solid phase extraction achieving rapid extraction of analyte with only a small amount of adsorbent . The three dimensional porous IL TGO was a new ideal adsorbent for fipronil due to the multiple adsorption interactions large adsorption capacity and fast adsorption rate . For this ISPE procedure the analyte was adsorbed by IL TGO through the pipette tip mode and then eluted through dispersive mode . Under the optimized condition the proposed method performed following merits good linearity precision high recoveries rapid extraction low consumption of adsorbent . The excellent recyclability of the ISPE device and the reusability of IL TGO were observed and high recovery of fipronil was obtained after fifteen cycles . This work might provide promising strategy for the sensitive extraction and analysis of trace levels of fipronil from egg products .

@highlight ISPE a new form of SPE method is developed combing advantages of PT SPE and DSPE.
