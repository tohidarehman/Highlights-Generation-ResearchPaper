 The impact of marine incursions during transgression on the quantity and quality of organic matter in lacustrine source rocks is critical to understanding their source rock properties and therefore on their hydrocarbon generation potential but is also challenging and controversial . Here we examine this issue based on a case study in the South Yellow Sea Basin offshore eastern China addressing organic matter quantity quality and petroleum generation kinetics . A total of 139 lacustrine source rock samples was collected from the fourth member of the Paleocene Funing Formation E

@highlight The influence of marine incursions on South Yellow Sea Basin lacustrine source rocks was addressed.
@highlight Combined marine fossils and biomarkers corroborated marine incursions.
@highlight Marine incursion enhanced OM quality as indicated by HI and
@highlight values.
@highlight Marine incursion led to the preservation of a more homogenous OM.
@highlight South 4th Sag is preferred for the most promising hydrocarbon exploration of SYSB.
