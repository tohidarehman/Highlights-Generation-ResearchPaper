 The enantiomeric determination of chiral drugs in the environment is of emerging concern since their enantiomers often exhibit stereoselectivity in environmental occurrence fate and toxicity . In this study a method based on solid phase extraction followed by chiral liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry has been developed for the enantiomeric determination of a group of cathinones in river water and effluent wastewater . The enantioseparation was carried out using a Chiralpak CBH column in reversed phase mode and optimised by evaluating the effects of flow rate buffer concentration and organic modifier . Under optimal conditions good enantioseparations R
