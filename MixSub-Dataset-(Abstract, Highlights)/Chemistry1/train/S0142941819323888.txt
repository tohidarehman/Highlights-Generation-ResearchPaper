 The fatigue life enhancement of fiber metal laminates through embedment of nanofiller into the epoxy has not reported hitherto and it is the subject of this investigation . Due to its outstanding mechanical properties nanoalumina is chosen as filler to enhance the fatigue life of FMLs . Tension tension low cycle fatigue tests were conducted at various stress levels with different percentage of nanofillers at constant frequency and stress ratio . The results showed that the fatigue characteristics of nano modified FMLs outclassed the neat epoxy FMLs and the 0.1 wt percentage of nanoalumina is found to be optimum . Improvement in fatigue life of FML is around 46 45 and 94 at a stress level of 50 60 and 70 of ultimate tensile strength respectively at optimum nanoalumina . The great enhancement in fatigue life is attributed to the combined effect of interfacial strengthening crack bridging and pullout of nanoalumina as evident from macro to nano scale fractography .
