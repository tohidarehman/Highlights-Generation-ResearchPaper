 Until today ion pair reversed phase chromatography is still the dominating method for analytical characterization of synthetic oligonucleotides . Its hyphenation with mass spectrometry however has some drawbacks such as ion suppression in electrospray ionization . To overcome this problem we present in this work a multiple heart cutting two dimensional liquid chromatography method with ultra violet and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry detection . A reversed phase weak anion exchange stationary phase in the first dimension

@highlight Multiple heart cutting 2D liquid chromatography method for oligonucleotide analysis.
@highlight A mixed mode RP WAX column provided high selectivity between similar oligos in

@highlight The
@highlight D with RPLC using a C18 column was used for desalting.
@highlight The MS compatible eluent in
@highlight D devoid of ion pair allowed sensitive MS detection.
@highlight Structurally closely related synthetic oligonucleotides were characterized by TOF MS.
