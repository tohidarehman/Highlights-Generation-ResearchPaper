 The potential of Micellar Electrokinetic Chromatography to achieve enantiomeric separations is reviewed in this article . The separation principles and the most frequently employed separation strategies to achieve chiral separations by Micellar Electrokinetic Chromatography are described . The use of chiral micellar systems alone or combined with other micellar systems or chiral selectors as well as of mixtures of achiral micellar systems with chiral selectors is discussed together with the effect of different additives present in the separation medium . Indirect methods based on the derivatization of analytes with chiral derivatizing reagents and the use of achiral micelles are also considered . Preconcentration techniques employed to improve sensitivity and the main approaches developed to facilitate the coupling with Mass Spectrometry are included . The most recent and relevant methodologies developed by chiral Micellar Electrokinetic Chromatography and their applications in different fields are presented .
