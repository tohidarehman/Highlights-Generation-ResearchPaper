 In this study a murine monoclonal antibody of 6D2 G10 against bacitracin zinc was produced and applied to an immunochromatographic strip for the initial detection of BAC in milk . The ICS with a cut off value of 25ng mL could be perceived by the naked eye within 10min . With the assist of the strip reader the limit of detection was measured as 0.82ng mL the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC

@highlight A highly sensitive monoclonal antibody mAb against bacitracin was produced.
@highlight An immunoassay strip was developed for monitoring BAC in milk.
@highlight This strip was accurate and reliable based on the results of recovery test.
