 In this study air dried sheet showed higher molecular weight proteins lipids and more gel content than the low protein natural rubber from alkaline treatment or acetone extracted natural rubber . After removal of proteins and lipids LPNR and AENR had shorter scorch and cure times among the rubber compounds observed . This is due to higher content of free fatty acids glycerides and sodium salts of fatty acid that might act as cure activators with sulfur curing . Furthermore a finer dispersion of CB was found in ADS due to chemical interactions of CB with proteins and lipids at terminal ends of NR molecules . Also high molecular weight and gel in ADS could induce a higher reinforcing index

@highlight Alkaline treatment and acetone extraction caused reduction of

@highlight ADS compound had finer dispersion of CB due to chemical interactions with terminals of NR molecules.
@highlight Proteins and lipids play important role in vulcanization and properties of CB filled NR vulcanizates.
