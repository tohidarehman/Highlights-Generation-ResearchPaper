 This paper describes a procedure for the isolation of 20 organic micro pollutants among pesticides drugs recreational drugs flame retardants from river sediments . After a solid liquid extraction with a methanol water solution the supernatant was diluted with water and cleaned up by stir disc solid phase extraction . The disc was made of buckypaper a self supporting entangled assembly of carbon nanotubes which was used as a highly porous two sided sorbent membrane . In the preliminary activation step the membrane was oxidised for 2 hours with nitric acid to extend its extraction capability also to more polar compounds . All extracts were analysed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . A comparative investigation with commercial Strata X Polymeric Reversed Phase SPE cartridges proved the effectiveness of the lab made device . On the average the analytes were recovered with yields around 69 and 80 while only a couple of analytes exhibited values less than 50 . The relative standard deviation was always less than 20 . Limits of detections were in the range 0.029.9ng g

@highlight A disc SPE procedure based on the use of a buckypaper membrane has been developed.
@highlight Hydrophobic emerging contaminants were cleaned up from sediment efficiently.
@highlight Easiness of use and high throughput are the main advantages of the SPE device.
@highlight The disc SPE device is more efficient than a conventional SPE cartridge.
@highlight The buckypaper disc can be regenerated and reused up to ten times.
