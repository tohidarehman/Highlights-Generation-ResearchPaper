 We studied a large dataset of 2600 shale gas samples from 76 geological formations in 38 sedimentary basins located in eleven countries . Shale gases contain mostly hydrocarbons dominated by methane . Shale gases can have primary microbial secondary microbial and thermogenic origin . However gases produced from most commercially successful shale plays are thermogenic . It appears that formations with greater gas endowment such as the Marcellus and the Haynesville contain late mature thermogenic gas . Shale plays with early mature thermogenic and secondary microbial gas such as the Antrim and the New Albany formations have relatively low endowments of recoverable gas . Shale plays with primary microbial gas are not significant from commercial exploration perspective . Isotope reversals

@highlight Isotope fractionation during desorption from depressurized mature shales leads to isotope reversal.
