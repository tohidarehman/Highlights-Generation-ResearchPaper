 Ion exchange chromatography is extensively used in the purification of biological compounds . Reliable mathematical models describing this chromatographic technique are available and can be used to improve the performance of this separation step . However the use of synthetic mixtures for model development hampers the application of this approach with real cell extracts processed in downstream operations . This work presents an original approach for handling non synthetic genuine mixtures of proteins which was applied in the purification of an untagged recombinant pneumococcal surface protein A . First evaluation was made of the efficiency of steric mass action and modified Langmuir isotherms which were separately used together with the equilibrium dispersive model . The data used for parameter estimation and model validation were obtained from anion exchange chromatography runs applied to real cell extracts produced by different cultivation strategies . Simulations showed that the models were able to describe the complex mixtures of unknown proteins . Next the EDM and SMA approaches were used to separately describe the profile of PspA4Pro and the pool of protein impurities eluted together . The simulations showed that PspA4Pro tended to elute at the beginning of the peak enabling the establishment of an alternative elution schedule that provided a 34 increase in the purity achieved using the anion exchange chromatography .
