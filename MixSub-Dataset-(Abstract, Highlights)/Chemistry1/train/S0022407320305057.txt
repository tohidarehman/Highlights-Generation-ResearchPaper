 In this work the scattering absorption and the far field thermal emission properties of clusters of randomly distributed magneto optical nanoparticles are studied considering spectral directional and polarization state of the electromagnetic waves . We observe the Zeeman splitting effect in the scattered absorbed and far field emitted energy the magnitude of which are directly influenced by the multiple scattering effect among the nanoparticles . The scattering and thermally emitted waves by the cluster have large degrees of circular polarization in directions parallel to the applied magnetic field

@highlight Electromagnetic scattering absorption and thermal emission of clusters of randomly distributed magneto optical nanoparticles are investigated for the dynamical tuning of the apparent radiative properties of magneto optical particle dispersed system.
