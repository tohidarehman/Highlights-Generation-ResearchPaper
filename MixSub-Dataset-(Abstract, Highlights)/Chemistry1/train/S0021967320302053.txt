 Gas chromatography mass spectrometry is a robust analytical platform for analysis of small molecules . Recently it is widely used for large scale metabolomics studies in which hundreds or even thousands of samples are analyzed simultaneously producing a very large and complex GC MS datasets . A number of software are currently available for processing GC MS data but it is too compute intensive for them to efficiently and accurately align chromatographic peaks from thousands of samples . Here we report a newly developed software QPMASS for analysis of large scale GC MS data . The parallel computing with an advanced dynamic programming approach is implemented in QPMASS to align peaks from multiple samples based on retention time and mass spectra enabling fast processing large scale datasets . Furthermore the missing value filtering and backfilling are introduced into the program greatly reducing false positive and false negative errors to be less than 5 . We demonstrated that it took only 8h to align and quantify a GC TOF MS dataset from 300 rice leaves samples and 17h to process a GC qMS dataset from 1000 rice seed samples by using a personal computer . QPMASS is written in C programming language and is able to run under Windows operation system with a user friendly interface .

@highlight QPMASS is developed for quickly processing large scale GC MS data.
@highlight It can achieve accurate peak alignment results with low misalignment rate .
@highlight It has high accuracy in peak quantification.
@highlight It runs under commonly used Windows system.
