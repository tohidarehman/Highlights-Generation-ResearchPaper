 By means of the plane wave pseudo potential method based on density functional theory a thorough investigation was carried out into the equilibrium structures and stability of species covered and surfaces of Al

@highlight For the Al
@highlight Ga
@highlight N 0001 surfaces with same Al composition the surfaces with more coordination N atoms shows more stability while the surface full covered by hydrogen is unstable.
@highlight For the Al
@highlight Ga
@highlight N 0001 surfaces with different Al compositions the surface stability with the same covering specie is improved as the increase of surface Al composition.
@highlight For the H covered Al
@highlight Ga
@highlight N 000 surfaces the stability deteriorates with the higher Al composition.
