 Natural fibers are inexpensive biodegradable and have similar specific properties to some synthetic fibers . Hardly any previous investigations exist of a composite made of multiple layers of pure Kevlar fiber fabric and pure Flax fiber fabric in a sandwich structure but it only measured impact properties . The composite was made of 12 Flax epoxy layers at the core in 3 possible configurations

@highlight Various mechanical tests evaluated properties of a new Kevlar Flax Epoxy composite.
@highlight Hybridization of kevlar fibers with flax fibers offered superior mechanical performance.
@highlight Kevlar fibers created a hydrophobic protective effect resulting in a much lower moisture absorption than flax fibers.
@highlight Neat flax fibers had the highest hardness compared to any KFE hybrids.
@highlight This is the first study to measure the hardness of KFE hybrids.
