 A novel column coupling approach is suggested to improve both the selectivity and efficiency of protein separations in liquid chromatography . Protein separations often suffer from limited selectivity or not appropriate resolving power . For a new biopharmaceutical product the identification of the main and minor variant species is required . For that purpose often offline collection fractioning is applied which is time consuming and regularly dilute the samples to an unacceptable extent . By serially coupling columns in the order of their increasing retentivity and applying multi isocratic elution mode indeed any selectivity can be attained . Moreover if a protein peak is trapped at the inlet of a later column segment of a coupled system its band will be refocused and elute in unprecedented sharp peak . Furthermore it becomes possible to perform online on column fractioning of protein species within a very short analysis time and without sample dilution . Two three or multiple column systems can be developed and applied for complex sample separations . This new methodology can be particularly useful to improve the analysis of therapeutic mAbs and related products and offers benefits compared to offline fractionating . It is also demonstrated in this proof of concept study that methyl modified RP phase has a great potential for protein separations despite it is not commercially available in state of the art wide pore superficially porous particle format ..
