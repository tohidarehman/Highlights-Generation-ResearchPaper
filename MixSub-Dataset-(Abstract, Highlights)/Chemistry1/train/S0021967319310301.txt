 Wastewater based epidemiology is a growing research field which provides valuable information on community drug use and chemical exposure . One parameter critical to estimations of drug use is the catchment area population . A population biomarker could be used to provide this information . This study evaluated the analytical suitability of three endogenous biomarkers of human activity the serotonin metabolite 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid which has previously been proposed and two further candidates the catecholamine metabolites vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid . An analytical method involving derivatization was developed and validated for two candidates 5 HIAA and HVA by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry . The best performance was obtained for VMA as the underivatized analyte . The derivatized extracts produced a 100 times better sensitivity . The three neurotransmitter metabolites were evaluated as population biomarkers in wastewater samples . All were stable in sample not lost upon filtration and showed stable inter day mass loads over seven days for a metropolitan wastewater treatment plant . When applied to a small community during a festival period mass loads of both HVA and VMA reflected the increase in the catchment population whilst 5 HIAA proved to be more variable .

@highlight Development of a UHPLC MS MS method for neurotransmitter metabolites in wastewater.
@highlight Derivatization substantially enhanced sensitivity for 5 HIAA and HVA.
@highlight Low inter day mass load variability for 5 HIAA HVA and VMA was measured.
@highlight HVA and VMA followed transient population changes in wastewater during a festival.
