 Ultralight flexible polymers enable promising application in many fields but are often hindered by low reusability with fatigue failure weak mechanical stability and low temperature resistance . Here superelastic polyimide nanofiber aerogels with high hydrophobicity have been prepared by utilizing the polyamic acid nanofibers to construct a continuous and isotropic fibrous architecture . Fiber bonding effect is designed to endow the PNFAs with the structure derived superelasticity . The results demonstrate that the PNFAs possess ultralight densities 9.719.1mgcm

@highlight The PNFAs were fabricated by combining electrospinning and fibrous freeze shaping technique.
@highlight Fiber bonding effect was designed to endow the PNFAs with continuous fibrous structure.
@highlight The PNFAs possessed low plastic deformation after 1000 compressive cycles.
@highlight The PNFAs exhibited fatigue resistance high adsorption capacity and high temperature resistance.
@highlight The reusable PNFAs can be used in the fields of heat insulation flexible sensors and oil water separation.
