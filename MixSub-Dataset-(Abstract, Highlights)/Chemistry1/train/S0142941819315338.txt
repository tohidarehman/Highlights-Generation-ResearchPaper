 The present work investigated the effects of non ionic surfactant treatment on the dispersibility surface chemistry and structure of carbon nanotube particles . Subsequently the fracture experiments of as prepared epoxy

@highlight Improved fracture behaviors of nanocomposite with surfactant treatment were obtained.
@highlight An optical DIC method along with high speed imaging was used to extract dynamic SIFs histories.
@highlight Introduced steric repulsive force improved the dispersibility of CNTs throughout the matrix domain.
@highlight Improved dispersibility and interfacial adhesion could provide stronger interfacial interactions.
@highlight Physical adsorption of the surfactant molecule did not compromise the conductive functionalities of CNT networks.
