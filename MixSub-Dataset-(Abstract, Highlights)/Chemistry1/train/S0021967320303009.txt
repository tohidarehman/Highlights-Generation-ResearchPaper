 Capto Core 700 is a core shell chromatographic support with an adsorbing core contained within an inert shell layer designed to purify larger biomolecules and bioparticles in a flow through mode . The present study aims to characterize the structure and functional properties of this resin using bovine serum albumin and thyroglobulin as model impurity proteins . The functionalized adsorbing core and the inert shell have the same fibrous structure typical of agarose based beads . The resin average bead size is 90.7m with a range of 50130m the shell thickness is 4.18m with a range of 36m and a standard deviation of 0.55m and the pore radius obtained by inverse size exclusion chromatography is 50.41.3nm . Both proteins present highly favorable binding isotherms with maximum binding capacities of 55 and 105mg mL of total bead volume for BSA and Tg respectively . The addition of 500mM NaCl reduces the binding capacity by less than 50 showing the ability of the resin to operate at high salt conditions . For both proteins the effective pore diffusivity in the core is smaller than in the shell due to additional hindrance by bound protein in the core area . Effective pore diffusivities values in the core are 1.610
