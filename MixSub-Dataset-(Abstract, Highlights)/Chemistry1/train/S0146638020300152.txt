 Identifying the lacustrine haptophyte species that produce long chain alkenones is essential for using alkenone unsaturation ratios to create lake water temperature reconstructions . We discovered LCAs in the brackish Lake Takahoko in northern Japan . The identity of LCA producing species was investigated using 18S ribosomal DNA and organic geochemical analysis . Two distinct genetic groups termed Tak A and Tak B were identified within the Group II haptophyte phylotype . Tak A was closely related to Hap A which was obtained from Lake George USA and Tak B was identified as

@highlight We discovered LCAs in the brackish Lake Takahoko in northern Japan.
@highlight Two distinct Group II haptophytes are responsible for LCAs production.
@highlight Lake Takahoko may be suitable for alkenone paleotemperature reconstruction.
