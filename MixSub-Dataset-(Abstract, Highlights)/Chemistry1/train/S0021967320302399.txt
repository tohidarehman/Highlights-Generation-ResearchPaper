 Phase ratio for an high performance liquid chromatography column is a parameter defined as the ratio between the volume of the stationary phase

@highlight Evaluates the phase ratio for three C18 columns at seven temperatures between 20 C and 50 C.
@highlight Shows that phase ratio in RP HPLC varies with temperature.
@highlight Describes the implications of phase ratio variation with temperature on the use of vant t Hoff plots for the evaluation of enthalpy and entropy for RP HPLC separations.
