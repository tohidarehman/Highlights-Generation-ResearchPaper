 Iron is a key micronutrient essential for many biological events . While iron deficiency can lead to anemia supplementation with oral iron often ends up with enteral iron overload a critical gastrointestinal burden linked to the increased risk of dysbiosis infections and often associated with colorectal cancer . Iron chelation therapy is clinically used to reduce pathological systemic iron overload by established low molecular weight iron chelators . As drawbacks these drugs present low pharmacokinetic profiles and several toxicities leading to relatively high rates of adverse effects . To overcome these issues the prevention of iron accumulation in the GI tract by non absorbable iron binding polymers could represent an alternative still underexploited approach . Here we present the development of a series of insoluble polymeric Fe chelators . These innovative compounds have been obtained by the conjugation of 3 hydroxypyridin 4 one Fe chelating moiety with branched Polyethyleneimine and Carboxymethyl cellulose . In vitro binding studies indicated that the Fe chelating capacity depends on the nature of the polymer . In particular PEI derivatives possess higher selectivity toward Fe in simulated intestinal fluid preserving the integrity of intestinal enterocytes representing thus promising compounds in the development of iron chelators .

@highlight Polyethylenimine PEI and Carboxymethyl cellulose CMC were functionalized with Fe III binding 3 hydroxypyridin 4 one.
@highlight PEI derivatives were prepared using maltol and microwave irradiation.
@highlight Both PEI and CMC derivatives did not alter the integrity of intestinal enterocytes.
