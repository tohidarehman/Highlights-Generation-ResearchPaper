 Laser spectroscopy methods were used in the investigation of the Zeeman hyperfine structure of 14 lines of atomic niobium in the visible region 585.279637.481nm . We used the laser induced fluorescence method and for higher lying states the fluorescence depletion spectroscopy . The magnetic field of approximately 800G was generated by a permanent neodymium magnet . The source of niobium atoms was a hollow cathode discharge tube . We determined experimentally for the first time the Lande

@highlight Laser spectroscopy methods LIF and FDS were used in measurements of the Zeeman hf structure of atomic niobium.
@highlight New experimental gJ factors have been determined for 6 energy levels of Nb I.
@highlight Hfs and gJ data for many other levels of Nb I have been tested and verified.
@highlight In the computer analysis of the spectra the saturation effect was taken into account.
