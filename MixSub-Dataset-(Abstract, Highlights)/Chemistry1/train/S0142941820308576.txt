 This paper presents a method for the non destructive inspection and quantitative comparison of low velocity impact damage in thermoplastic and thermoset composites . X ray microscope computed tomography is used to analyse the three dimensional internal damage in carbon fibre poly ether ether ketone and carbon fibre epoxy laminates . With the materials and testing conditions used it was shown that thermoplastic composites have better interlaminar and intralaminar properties and the following quantitative conclusions were drawn . Under the same impact energy the maximum contact force of AS4 PEEK laminate was approximately twice that of CCF300 Epoxy laminate . Dissection of the reconstructed XRM volume along a characteristic slicing surface showed that AS4 PEEK had less internal damage than CCF300 epoxy . When the impact energy was 15J the XRM results showed that the sum of delamination areas between each ply in AS4 PEEK was only 9 of that in CCF300 Epoxy whereas the ultrasonic C scan results showed that the total delamination area of AS4 PEEK was 54.78 of that of CCF300 Epoxy .

@highlight Comparison works on thermoplastic and thermoset composites have been made using non destructive X ray microscope inspection.
@highlight Thermoplastic composite has better interlaminar and intralaminar properties.
@highlight The extent of impact damage evaluated by C scan and XRM are quite different.
@highlight Delamination between each ply was revealed by slicing the reconstructed XRM volume with a characteristic slicing surface.
@highlight As a 3D NDT method XRM can character the internal damage of materials more accurately than traditional 2D NDT method.
