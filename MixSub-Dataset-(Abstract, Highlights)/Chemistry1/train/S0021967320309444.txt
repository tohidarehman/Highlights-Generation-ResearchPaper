 This review overviews the main developments achieved in analytical sample preparation regarding the use of solid sorbents as extractants in different sorbent based miniaturized micro scale and microextraction methods . Two main groups are proposed for the classification of the current approaches based on their operational mode micro solid phase extraction and solid phase microextraction while describing their respective main sub modes static and dispersive SPE and SPME with fibers and

@highlight Sorbent based microextraction strategies are classified in SPME or SPE
@highlight Operational steps and sorbent configuration are the criteria for the classification
@highlight Main advances within each technique are thoroughly overviewed
@highlight New geometries automation and novel sorbent materials are highlighted
