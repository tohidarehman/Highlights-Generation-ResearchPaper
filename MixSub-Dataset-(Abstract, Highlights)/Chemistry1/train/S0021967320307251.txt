 This paper reported a new method for the determination of the water distribution in sludge . It was based on a multiple headspace extraction procedure to step wise remove the water vapor from a closed vial containing a sludge sample followed by a gas chromatographic measurement . By plotting the GC signal of water vapor vs. the headspace extraction number three different trend lines from the profile can be observed . From which two transition points can be determined and thus the stages for the free water capillary water and adsorption water release can be divided . Based on the sum of GC peak areas ate each stage the content of these water types in the sludge can be calculated through a method calibration . The results showed that the MHE GC method has a better measurement repeatability and sensitivity than the thermal drying method . There was also a good agreement between the MHE GC and the reference method on the free water and capillary water analysis . Moreover the results on the adsorption water and bound water testing by the present method is more justifiable than the reference method .
