 Inspired by the fact that antibody recognizes antigen s epitope rather than its whole structure we selected the glycosyl moiety of teicoplanin as the template 4 vinylphenylboronic acid and methyl methacrylate as the functional monomers and divinylbenzene as the cross linker to synthesis molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres

@highlight The glycosyl moiety of teicoplanin was used as a template for boronate affinity molecular imprinting.
@highlight The MIPs showed pH controlled catch and release recognition mechanism.
@highlight Highly sensitive detection of five teicoplanin components was achieved with an instrumental analysis time of 4min.
