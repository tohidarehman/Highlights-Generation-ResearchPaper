 Monitoring preparative protein chromatographic steps by in line spectroscopic tools or fraction analytics results in medium or large sized data matrices . Multivariate Curve Resolution serve to compute or to estimate the concentration values of the pure components only from these data matrices . However MCR methods often suffer from an inherent solution ambiguity which underlies the factorization problem . The typical unimodality of the chromatographic profiles of pure components can support the chemometric analysis . Here we present the pure components estimation process within the framework of the area of feasible solutions which is a systematic approach to represent the range of all possible solutions . The unimodality constraint in combination with Pareto optimization is shown to be an effective method for the pure component calculation . Applications are presented for chromatograms on a model protein mixture containing ribonuclease A cytochrome c and lysozyme and on a two dimensional chromatographic separation of a monoclonal antibody from its aggregate species . The root mean squared errors of the first case study are 0.0373 0.0529 and 0.0380 g L compared to traditional off line analytics . The second case study illustrates the potential of recovering hidden components with MCR from off line reference analytics .
