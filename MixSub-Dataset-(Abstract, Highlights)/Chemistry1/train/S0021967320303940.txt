 Chiral stationary phases have always been research hotspot in enantiomer separation . Currently most of the CSPs are based on silica platform . In this research monodisperse porous glycidyl methacrylate divinylbenzene copolymer particles were designed and prepared . Then the GMA was further reacted with ethylenediamine to introduce amino groups onto the polymer which provide anchoring sites for cellulose derivatives . Herein Cellulose tris was successfully coated onto the polymer microspheres achieving a stable and successful CSP . The porous structure and the surface moieties of the CSPs were studied in detail . The chromatographic separation was optimized . Hexaconazole methyl DL mandelate benzoin and tebuconazole have been successfully separated on the CSP column with column efficiency as high as 10 200 plates m which is comparable with some silica based CSPs . The research has indicated that the poly is a promising candidate for constructing CSPs for chiral separation .

@highlight Mono dispersed porous glycidyl methacrylate divinylbenzene particles were prepared.
@highlight The particles were aminated for coating with cellulose tris 3 5 dimethylphenylcarbamate .
@highlight They were used as the chiral stationary phase with high column efficiency.
@highlight The polymer particles were alternative stationary matrix for chiral separation.
