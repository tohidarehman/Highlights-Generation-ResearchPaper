 Supercritical fluid chromatography the most common mode of which employs pressurized carbon dioxide as the mobile phase is enjoying resuscitation . It is once again reconsidered as a fast developing chromatographic technique for the separation and identification of compounds in mixtures . In recent years significant improvements in instrumentation and its proficiency in specialized applications have rekindled interest in the technique . SFC applicability in various fields such as pharmaceutical analysis bioanalysis forensic science environmental analysis food science has continued to expand . The present article delineates a comprehensive up to date overview of the applications of SFC in pesticide analysis including the monitoring of their residues in different matrices and the investigation of their environmental behaviors such as dissipation and bioaccumulation . Since 30 of currently registered pesticides are chiral compounds attention is also paid to the analysis of such pesticides due to their enantioselective biological activities . Thus both achiral and chiral SFC in pesticide analysis is reviewed . The article covers discussions on chromatographic conditions method validation and sample preparation as well as comparisons with gas chromatographic and liquid chromatographic approaches .

@highlight Applications of both chiral and achiral SFC in pesticides analysis are reviewed.
@highlight A considerable span of time helps reader understand the evolution of SFC.
@highlight Pesticide residue analysis and environmental behavior investigation are covered.
