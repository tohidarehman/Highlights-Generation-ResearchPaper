 Low energy ion scattering was employed for the analysis of thin films of Mo Ru Hf Al and their oxides . Measurements with different He

@highlight LEIS showed changes in He
@highlight neutralization for oxides of Mo Ru Hf but not Al.
@highlight The increased neutralization in RuO
@highlight  HfO
@highlight and MoO
@highlight is due to the O 2s band.
@highlight Al is possibly an exception due to efficient auger neutralization of clean metal.
@highlight The sputtering of pure metal or oxide surfaces does not interfere in neutralization.
@highlight This study shows how to select a proper reference sample for quantitative LEIS.
