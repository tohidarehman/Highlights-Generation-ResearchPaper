 Polycarbonate composites with low weight have been required for mobile applications . Herein the incorporation of 15 phr soda lime borosilicate hollow glass microspheres into a PC matrix reduced the specific gravity by 15.2 . The microsphere preservation rate was systematically examined depending on HGM compressive strength and processing conditions for extrusion and injection molding . Various transition temperatures such as glass transition temperatures and heat distortion temperature were investigated as a function of HGM . The coefficient of thermal expansion of the 15 phr HGM embedded PC composites was reduced by 51.9 . The rheological behavior of the composites was also probed . The toughness was reduced due to the ductile to brittle transition of PC caused by the incorporation of fillers despite the enhanced modulus . The incorporation of the robust hollow glass microspheres into a PC composite via a delicately designed screw configuration and suitable processing conditions can be used for low density composites such as mobile applications .
