 Poly and perfluoroalkyl substances have been investigated in a number of cohort studies due to concern over their adverse health effects . The aim of this study was to develop a reliable high throughput and cost effective analytical method for a broad range of PFAS in human serum . Protein precipitation automatic solid phase extraction pre treatment and column switching LC MS MS were employed . The optimised and validated method was then used to analyse the levels of 28 PFAS in 339 maternal serum samples from Pilot Study of the Japan Environment and Children s Study . Perfluorooctanoic acid perfluorononanoic acid perfluoroundecanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulphonic acid were detected in all 339 samples at median concentrations of 1.9 1.5 1.3 and 3.7 ng ml respectively . These levels are comparable to those reported in previous studies using samples collected from various parts of the world . With a few exceptions the remainder of the PFAS examined had lower detection rates but were found at concentrations similar to those reported in previous studies . The sensitivity and throughput ability of the method developed here are sufficient for its application in a large scale biomonitoring study .

@highlight An on line SPE LC MS MS method was developed for 28 PFAS in human plasma serum.
@highlight The method had sufficient sensitivity and throughput for a large scale study.
@highlight The method was used for the Japan Environment and Children s Study JECS .
@highlight The PFAS levels in this study were similar to those reported in previous studies.
