 In the last decade 3D printing has emerged as a promising enabling technology in the field of analytical chemistry . Fused deposition modelling is a popular low cost and widely accessible technique . In this study RPLC separations are achieved by in situ fabrication of porous polymer monoliths directly within the 3D printed channels . Thermal polymerization was employed for the fabrication of monolithic columns in optically non transparent column housings 3D printed using two different polypropylene materials . Both acrylate based and polystyrene based monoliths were created . Two approaches were used for monolith fabrication

@highlight 3D printed channels were successfully developed in house.
@highlight Monoliths were fabricated in polypropylene 3D printed channels
@highlight SEM results showed homogenous monolithic structures
@highlight Glass reinforced polypropylene has shown more potential for chromatography
@highlight Separation of small molecules were performed in the channels.
