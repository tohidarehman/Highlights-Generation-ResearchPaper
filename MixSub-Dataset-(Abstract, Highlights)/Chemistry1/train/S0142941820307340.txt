 Poor water resistance and curing layer brittleness are significant challenges of greener soybean meal adhesive promotion and application . In this study an elastic network was built to crosslink the SM adhesive and improve the cured layer toughness of the resultant adhesive . Long chain organo sepiolite was first prepared by compound modification using KH 560 and KH 602 silane coupling agents . Triglycidylamine a greener crosslinking agent with a large number of effective epoxy functional groups was then synthesized . SM based adhesives were fabricated using SM OSEP and TGA . Results indicated that an elastic network was fabricated by the cross linked reaction of SM OSEP and TGA . The elastic network effectively improved the toughness of the resultant adhesive . The wet shear strength of the plywood bonded by SM with 1 OSEP increased by 60 to 1.25MPa relative to that of the SM TGA adhesive . This study provided a greener simple and cheap method improving the toughness and wet shear strength of SM based adhesive which contributes to the industrialized application of the product .
