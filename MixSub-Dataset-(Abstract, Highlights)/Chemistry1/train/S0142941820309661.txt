 As flammable natural rubber becomes more ubiquitous in industrial fields there is a growing need for safe and effective flame retardant treatments through efficient techniques . Remarkably our developed highly efficient natural tannic acid based intumescent flame retardant system has the unique function in the rubber flame retardant aspect . Meanwhile the developed coating method through polyurethane elastomer both as adhesive medium and a carbonforming agent can not only minimize the influence of flame retardant on the desirable intrinsic properties of base polymer and also maximize the efficiency of flame retardant . The flame retardant coating exhibits highly efficient flame retardant performances reflected by a 31.9 reduction in peak heat release rate and a 27.3 reduction in total heat release and a 26.2 reduction in total smoke production with 50wt loading in 1mm thick coating due to synergistic flame retardant effects . More importantly the excellent flame retardancy performance are obtained by the

@highlight An efficient elastomer based intumescent fire retardant and smoke suppression protective coating method is studied.
@highlight The developed intumescent flame retardant exhibits highly efficient ame retardant performances for NR.
@highlight The influence of coating method on mechanical properties of NR decreases obviously.
