 For the selectivity evaluation of core shell silica siloxane bonded reversed phase columns by the solvation parameter model a minimal set of thirty five calibration compounds were identified for applications with mobile phases containing from 20 70 methanol or acetonitrile water . The Kennard Stone uniform mapping algorithm was employed to select the calibration compounds from a larger database of compounds with known retention properties used previously for column selectivity evaluation . The number and identity of the calibration compounds was optimized by considering the statistical quality of the calibration models the absolute value for the standard deviation of the individual system constants and the closeness of the estimated system constants for the calibration models to the values for the full data set on seven core shell columns with different morphology for mobile phases containing 50 methanol or acetonitrile water . The predictive capability of the calibration models was evaluated for an external test set for 50 methanol water for the same columns with a typical root mean square error of prediction of 0.028 for the thirty five calibration compounds
