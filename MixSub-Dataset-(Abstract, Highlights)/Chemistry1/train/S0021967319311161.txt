 Application of the superficially porous particles grafted with chiral selectors can substantially improve resolution in chromatographic techniques . In this work we carried out a deeper study on supercritical fluid chromatography systems with 2.7m SPPs bonded with teicoplanin and vancomycin . Fast separations of the majority of enantiomers of phytoalexins substituted tryptophans and ketamine derivatives as representatives of important biologically active and structurally diverse chiral compounds have been achieved . The chromatographic behavior of the structurally different analytes served to characterize these separation systems . The influence of separation conditions namely mobile phase composition i.e . type of co solvent and additive on retention enantioselective resolution and enantioselectivity was examined . The success rate of baseline and partial separations in individual groups of compounds differed with the chiral stationary phase and also with mobile phase composition . The best baseline separations for the phytoalexins were achieved on the TeicoShell column using methanol as a co solvent and trifluoroacetic acid as an additive if used . Mostly partial separations were achieved on the vancomycin based column for all groups of analytes . Complementary separation behavior of these CSPs was confirmed for the majority of the chiral compounds examined in this work .
