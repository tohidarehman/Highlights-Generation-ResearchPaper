 This paper demonstrated a simple and rapid approach for the determination of lead dioxide in minium using a headspace gas chromatographic technique . This new approach was based on the measurement of carbon dioxide from the redox reaction between lead dioxide and oxalic acid in a sealed headspace vial . The obtained results indicated that the new approach had good measurement accuracy and precision . Moreover the limit of quantification and limit of detection for this new approach were respectively 0.34 and 0.10 and the recoveries ranged from 97.9 to 101.7 . The new approach is low cost and reliable which has potential for use in the analysis of lead dioxide in minium and related products .
