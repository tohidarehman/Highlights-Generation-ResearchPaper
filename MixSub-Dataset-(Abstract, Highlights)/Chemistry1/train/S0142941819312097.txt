 All organic composites are widely used in energy storage application due to the high breakdown strength performance but the improvement of energy storage was limited by the relatively low dielectric constant . Therefore to satisfy the high demands of dielectric materials energy storage properties of polymer composites should be further enhanced . In this article poly and polyurea which are known as high dielectric ferroelectric material and linearly high energy storage efficiency material respectively are composited through double layer casting method for the first time . The properties of DL structured composite film is contrasted with solution blending structure especially in energy storage efficiency and the results demonstrate that DL structure design can make great use of advantages of two materials and also can avoid the influence of phase separation between P and PUA efficiently . Moreover high breakdown strength and high energy storage efficiency of DL composites can be realized simultaneously by incorporating PUA as an insulating layer and the mechanism is discussed in detail . This work provides an effective route to improve the energy storage properties of polymer dielectric materials and shows great application potential .
