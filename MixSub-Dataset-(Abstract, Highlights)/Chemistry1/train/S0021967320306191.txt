 The recognition and separation of polar chiral compounds are important technological challenges in separation science . Taking full advantage of the intrinsically chiral environment and multiple interactions featured by macrocycles we designed the first example of porous methylated cyclodextrins containing polymers with three dimensional chiral channels . The enantioselective recognition of

@highlight A flexible cyclodextrin porous polymer material was synthesized.
@highlight The porous materials were utilized as adsorbent for polar chiral compounds absorption.
@highlight The porous materials were applied to chiral stationary phase for polar chiral compounds separation.
@highlight The chiral recognition mechanism was studied in detail.
