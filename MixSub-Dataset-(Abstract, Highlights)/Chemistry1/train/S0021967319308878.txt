 In counter current chromatography the hydrodynamic motion of a two phase solvent system in the column coil is very important . There are some previous visualization studies on CCC using stroboscopic photography . As CCC separation is a continuous liquid liquid extraction process observing the distribution and movement of the solvent system on line will be helpful to understand the hydrodynamic behavior during the whole CCC separation process . In the present study a high speed imaging camera was employed to take videos of a running CCC bobbin . The dynamic motion and phase distribution of conventional quaternary solvent system hexane ethyl acetate methanol water and ternary solvent system dichloromethane methanol water were both investigated . Wave like mixing was observed in the area where the centrifugal force is minimum in different diameter columns . When the coil rotated the mixing zone was fixed at the minimum centrifugal force position . Several photographs of the rotating coiled tube were taken which revealed that the phase dispersion hardly changes once equilibrium is established . Finally the sample dispersion process was also recorded . These results will help us to understand the separation process in a CCC column coil and also present some more interesting questions related to separation efficiency which are shown in discussion part of this paper .

@highlight Mixing zone was located near to the proximal key node and traveled through the column.
@highlight Every parts of bobbin went through a mixing settle process.
@highlight Phase distribution hardly changed once hydrodynamic has been established.
@highlight The sample diffusion was quite fast after injection which might cause low efficiency.
