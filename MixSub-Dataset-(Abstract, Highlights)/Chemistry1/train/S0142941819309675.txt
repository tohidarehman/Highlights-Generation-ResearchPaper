 Polymers and composite materials show temperature dependent material properties . Therefore the frequency resembles a critical part in fatigue testing due to its influence on the self heating of the polymeric material and thereby on the number of cycles to failure . The aim of this paper is the development of a testing method which allows comparable results with varying frequencies . To minimize the self heating effect on the fatigue behavior a model was established for selecting optimized frequencies regarding the load specific temperature increase of the specimen . A new energy parameter the induced energy rate was introduced and correlated to the load specific increase in temperature in multiple and constant amplitude tests at ambient conditions . With this approach it was possible to determine a threshold value for the newly defined induced energy rate . A stress specific model was developed and a limit frequency was calculated . The results were verified in multiple and constant amplitude tests and S N curves .
