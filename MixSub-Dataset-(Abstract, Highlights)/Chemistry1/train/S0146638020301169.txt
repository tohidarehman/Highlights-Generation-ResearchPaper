 Alkenones are polyunsaturated long chain methyl or ethyl ketones produced by species in the Isochrysidales an order of haptophyte algae . Based on phylogenetic data members of the Isochrysidales have been classified into three groups with each group showing significant differences in alkenone profiles and preferred growth environments . Common carbon chain lengths of alkenones range from 37 to 40 . Extended C
