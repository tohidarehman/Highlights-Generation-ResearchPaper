 The paper presents a study of the thermomechanical behavior of polylactide composites filled with two different types of basalt fillers micrometric basalt fibers and basalt powder incorporated into the polymeric matrix with the amount of 5 10 and 20wt . The composites were manufactured by melt processing and subjected to the annealing process in order to obtain a highly crystalline structure without the addition of nucleating agents . We found a remarkable enhancement of the thermomechanical stability of polylactide based composites filled with basalt powder and micrometric basalt fibers in the case of use of the thermal post processing procedure . Despite a relatively low nucleation ability of the fillers on PLA their presence in the case of annealed PLA samples caused an additional increase up to 15C of the heat deflection temperature . The BP filled composites reveal comparable thermomechanical properties improvement to BMF filled composites with higher resistance to adhesion loss in the polymer filler interface during annealing .

@highlight Synergistic effect of annealing and BP BMF addition on thermomechanical properties of PLA occurred.
@highlight Effectiveness of the basalt fillers on PLA matrix was enhanced by recrystallization of the matrix.
@highlight BP showed better interfacial adhesion to PLA than BMF.
@highlight The interfacial adhesion in PLA BP composites withstand a annealing process.
@highlight Thermomechanical parameters were used as indirect adhesion evaluation method.
