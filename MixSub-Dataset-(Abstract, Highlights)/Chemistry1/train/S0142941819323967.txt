 In the present work the effect of composition and related morphology on the fracture behavior of LLDPE PP blends was thoroughly investigated . Fracture behaviors evaluated under quasi static loading conditions and different fracture mechanics methodologies were applied to assess fracture toughness depending on the materials behavior . For pure PP and 2575 blend

@highlight Relative amount of PE and PP influences the fracture behavior of polyolefin blends.
@highlight Fracture behavior changes from completely ductile to fragile with addition of PP.
@highlight Fracture behavior and toughness are sensitive to differences in microstructure.
@highlight Fracture behavior is influenced by inhomogeneities induced by processing.
@highlight Fracture toughness of blends are lower than those of the individual constituents.
