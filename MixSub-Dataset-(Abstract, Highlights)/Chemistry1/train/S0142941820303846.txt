 The latex blending method was chosen to prepare Kaolinite emulsion polymerization styrene butadiene rubber nanocomposite to improve the interaction between filler particles and rubber matrix chains . The influences of kaolinite particles size filler contents and flocculants types on dynamic mechanical properties and the relative reinforcement mechanism of the prepared composite were systematic investigated and proposed . The transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that the kaolinite particles were finely dispersed into the rubber matrix and arranged in parallel orientation . The prepared nanocomposites by latex blending exhibited improved crosslinking characteristic and dynamic mechanical parameters . The KAl SO

@highlight A novel prepared method latex blending was utilized to improve the dispersion of kaolinite in ESBR matrix and obtain a semi exfoliation type clay polymer composite.
@highlight The dynamic properties of prepared rubber composites were improved and thus the dynamic reinforcement mechanism of kaolinite was proposed.
@highlight The micromorphology of kaolinite layer like particles presented loose and blurry in rubber matrix and which resulted in the reduction of kaolinite crystal order degree.
