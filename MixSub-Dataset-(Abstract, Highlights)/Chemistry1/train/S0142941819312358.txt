 Rubber blends are widely used for combining the advantages of individual rubber component . However to date how to determine and distinguish the vulcanization kinetics for each single rubber phase in rubber blends during the co vulcanization process are still a challenge . Herein high resolution pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry was employed for the first time to investigate the vulcanization kinetics of natural rubber and styrene butadiene rubber in their blends filled with graphene . It is shown that the crosslinking rate of NR chains
