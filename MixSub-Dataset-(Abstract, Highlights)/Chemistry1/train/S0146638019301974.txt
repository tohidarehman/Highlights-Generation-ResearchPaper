 This study shows results from amino acid analysis of seafloor sediment sampled between 80 and 130m depth within an active hydrothermal field located off Zannone Island . The total hydrolysable amino acid content was determined at eight stations three located within the main hydrothermal depression and five located in the surrounding seafloor . THAA concentration ranged between 2 and 11nmolmg

@highlight Hydrothermal conditions enhance amino acid degradation reducing their concentration.
@highlight Relative abundance of bacterial amino acids increases under hydrothermal conditions.
@highlight The degradation index suggests labile material outside the hydrothermal depression.
@highlight The reactivity index suggests reactive material outside the hydrothermal depression.
