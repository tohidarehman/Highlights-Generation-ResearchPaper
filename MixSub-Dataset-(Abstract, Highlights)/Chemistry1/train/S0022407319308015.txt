 Based on the generalized LorenzMie theory and the angular spectrum decomposition method we calculate the optical radiation force exerted on a lossless dielectric sphere of arbitrary size illuminated by an Airy light sheet . The beam shape coefficients of the Airy light sheet are calculated using the vector angular spectrum decomposition and vector spherical wave functions methods . The optical radiation force acting on the spherical particle is obtained by the integral of Maxwells stress tensor . The transverse
