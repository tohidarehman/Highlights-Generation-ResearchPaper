 Ordered porous materials are attracting enormous attention due to their uniform pore structures particularly the magnetic photonic crystal microspheres which not only possess unique photonic crystal structure but also can achieve separation easily based on magnet . Here a two phase microfluidic self assembly synthetic system was established simply and employed for the preparation of three dimensional PCMs by using the emulsion droplet approach . One phase was an aqueous emulsion containing Fe

@highlight Ordered macroporous magnetic silica photonic crystal microspheres were prepared.
@highlight Droplet based flow microfluidic self assembly method was employed to prepare the microspheres.
@highlight Particle size and content of the nanoparticles for self assemble affect the microspheres quality.
@highlight The structural properties of the microspheres were characterized and studied.
@highlight The method overcomes the nanoparticles disordered self assemble and the microspheres collapse.
