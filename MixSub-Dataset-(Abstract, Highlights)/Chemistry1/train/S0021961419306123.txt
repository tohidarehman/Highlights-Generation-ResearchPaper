 The preferential solvation parameters for the self association and the mutual association of each of N N dimethylformamide and propylene carbonate with a co solvent in their binary mixtures as well as the self association of each of these components at infinite dilution in the other component as solvent have been calculated from previously reported experimental data using the inverse Kirkwood Buff integrals approach .
