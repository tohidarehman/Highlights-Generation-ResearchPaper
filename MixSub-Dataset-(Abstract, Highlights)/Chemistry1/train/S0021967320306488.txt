 Effect of mobile phase composition on the enantioseparation of dipeptides on the chiral stationary phase Chirobiotic R was investigated using Ala Ala Leu Leu Gly Leu and Leu Gly as case studies . The lipophilicity of dipeptides was found to be an essential factor in the dependence of their retention on the methanol percentage the retention factor of lipophobic dipeptides increasing monotonously and that of lipophilic dipeptides changing according to an asymmetric U shaped trajectory as methanol concentration increases . The behavior of enantioselectivity as a function of the methanol content also depends on the lipophilicity of dipeptide . For lipophilic Leu Leu the dependence has a dome like shape and for more lipophobic dipeptides Ala Ala and Gly Leu it is an increasing function of the methanol concentration . The importance of solvation equilibria in the bulk liquid and on the surface of the stationary phase for the total retention is discussed from the thermodynamic point of view . Special consideration is given to the adsorption of the water methanol mixture on the surface of the Chirobiotic R stationary phase .
