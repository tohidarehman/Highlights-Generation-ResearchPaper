 The copolymerization of ethylene and different olefins could result in polyethylene with different structural topologies and lead to polyethylene products with different macroscopic performances . Herein three different polyethylene samples namely low density polyethylene

@highlight Three ethylene olefin copolymers were selected to construct the structure process property relationship on the film blowing.
@highlight The structural evolution during film blowing was captured by a combination of
@highlight SR SAXS WAXS and a custom built film blowing device.
@highlight The multi scale microstructure and dynamics of final films were characterized by
@highlight SAXS WAXS FTIR SEM and SS NMR.
@highlight The mechanical and optical properties of films are well correlated with their structural evolution and microstructure.
