 This work describes a novel approach for the analysis of 11 phenolic compounds in human milk . Clean up of the sample and extraction of 11 analytes from milk was performed by dispersive liquidliquid microextraction . Under the optimal conditions the extraction recoveries of 11 analytes were in a range from 94.3 to 108 . For determination of phenolic compounds in extracts LC ESI MS MS method was used . The calibration curves showed linearity in the concentration ranges from 0.01 to 1500ngmL
