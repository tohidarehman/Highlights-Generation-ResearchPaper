 Developing highly selective stationary phases is essential to address the issues for separation of analytes with similar properties and various components in complex samples . Herein we report a new triptycene based material functionalized with polycaprolactone moieties as the stationary phase with high resolution performance for gas chromatography . The TP PCL capillary column exhibited column efficiency of 5555 plates m and moderate polarity . On the column dozens of mixtures of positional and structural isomers can be well resolved involving benzene derivatives with varying substituents naphthalene derivatives alkanes and alcohols . It exhibits advantageous performance for high resolution of the critical pairs of alkylbenzenes phenols anilines and alkanes over the PCL column and commercial DB 35 MS column with similar polarity . Moreover the TP PCL column showed excellent separation repeatability and reproducibility with RSD values of 0.02 0.07 for run to run
