 Estimation of the properties of mesoporous aluminosilicates in various environments is important when assessing their sorption capacity . Using inverse liquid chromatography Hansen solubility parameters and linear free energy relationship parameters were calculated to determine the properties of aluminosilicates in a protic and an aprotic system using water and acetonitrile as the mobile phase respectively . The calculated Hansen parameters reflecting the ability of the material under investigation to different types of intermolecular interactions slightly differ depending on the mobile phase used . It was found that in the presence of water the surface of aluminosilicates shows a weaker ability to interact as evidenced by negative or near zero

@highlight Surface properties of aluminosilicates can be estimate using liquid chromatography.
@highlight The nature of the solvent affects the surface properties of aluminosilicates.
@highlight Water reduces ability of the aluminosilicates surface to interactions.
