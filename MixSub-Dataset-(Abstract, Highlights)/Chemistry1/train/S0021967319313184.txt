 The functionalization of covalent organic frameworks enhances chemical properties and expands future applications . Herein a facile strategy for sulfoacid functionalized COF is presented through post modification of covalent triazine frameworks platform . The magnetic solid phase extraction material is obtained by anchoring in situ Ni particles on CTF support Ni CTF SO

@highlight Magnetic sulfoacid functionalized covalent triazine framework was prepared maintaining porosity and crystallinity.
@highlight Benzene triazine and sulfoacid moieties afford dual retention mechanism of hydrophilic lipophilic balance and cation exchange.
@highlight Enriching basic benzimidazoles from food samples and reducing matrix effect simultaneously are achieved.
@highlight The developed method offers wide linear range good precision and low detection limit.
