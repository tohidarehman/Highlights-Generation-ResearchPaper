 In this study a novel magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer was prepared by surface imprinting technology using 2 oxin and 6 HNA as dual virtual templates and 4 vinyl pyridine as the functional monomer for extraction of patulin from the surface of magnetic nanoparticles . MMIPs were characterized by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy X ray diffraction and vibrating sample magnetometry . The results showed that the molecularly imprinted polymer was successfully coupled with magnetic nanoparticles and could be used as a magnetic selective recognition material . Moreover MMIPs have a greater adsorption capacity for PAT than conventional MIPs . The magnetic dispersion solid phase extraction procedure was optimized and then combined with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for detection of PAT in juice samples . The method showed excellent analytical performance in terms of linearity ranged between 0.5g L
