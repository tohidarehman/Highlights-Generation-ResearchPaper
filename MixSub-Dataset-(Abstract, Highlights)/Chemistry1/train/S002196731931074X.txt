 Haloacetic acids are the second largest class of disinfection by products by weight in water and are more cytotoxic and genotoxic to mammalian cells than trihalomethanes the first largest class of DBPs . Gas chromatography is the most widely used technique for determining HAAs . Due to their polar nature derivatization prior to GC analysis is required . Typically derivatization is undertaken with acidic methanol which converts HAAs to the corresponding methyl ester and HAAs are quantified by measuring HAAMEs . In this study the interference from two other groups of DBPs the haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides on the determination of HAAs was investigated . HANs and HAMs at a range of concentrations were subjected to the same derivatization and analytical procedures as HAAs . The stability of HANs and HAMs under strongly acidic conditions was assessed and the operative mechanism of interference was investigated . The results showed that HAMs significantly interfered with the determination of the corresponding HAAs and the transformation rates of HAMs ranged from 6.5 to 45.7 while the impact of HANs can be neglected . The stability of HANs and HAMs under strongly acidic conditions indicated that hydrolysis was not the cause of the interference . Instead it was proposed that HAMs react with methyl alcohol to generate the same corresponding HAAMEs that was generated when HAAs reacted with methyl alcohol . A method for revising HAA concentrations in the presence of HAMs is suggested .
