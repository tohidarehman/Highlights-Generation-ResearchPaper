 The aim of this study is to investigate the reinforcing effect of Ceratonia siliqua powder as a novel natural filler for polypropylene based composites . CS powder up to 20wt was filled into PP matrix by using high speed thermo kinetic mixer . Mechanical and thermal properties of CS filled PP based composites were investigated by tensile and three point bending test dynamic mechanical analysis thermogravimetric analysis differential scanning calorimetry analysis fourier transform infrared analysis and thermomechanical analysis . Morphology of the composites was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy . By filling 5 and 10 of CS into PP tensile strength and flexural strength of PP increased by about 32 and 23 respectively . This indicates that CS has a great potential to be used as reinforcing filler for PP composites . CS filling into PP led to lower coefficient of thermal expansion values which could help preventing the thermal expansion .

@highlight Ceratonia siliqua is a novel material for PP composites.
@highlight Tensile strength increased by 32 with 5 CS into PP.
