 In this work the Dubsky s model proposed for Capillary Electrophoresis enantioseparation systems with a mixture of chiral selectors was applied to the rapid optimization of the simultaneous enantiomeric separation of a multicomponent mixture of six phenoxy acid herbicides using a dual system of two cyclodextrins CD and heptakis CD . Simply by carrying out a small number of individual experiments separately with each CD the Dubsky s model enabled to foresee the results that could be obtained for any possible combination of concentrations and relative proportion of both CDs in the mixture . Results obtained in this work demonstrated that the model was successful by improving the previous results experimentally obtained by the trial and error method for the simultaneous enantiomeric separation of the six phenoxy acid herbicides studied in this work . In fact the separation was improved in terms of enantiomeric resolutions obtained and by considerably reducing the time to optimize the separation conditions enabling to find in a faster and efficient way the most adequate proportion of both CDs and the concentration of each CD in the mixture to obtain baseline separation of the twelve enantiomers . Additionally the apparent complexation constants between enantiomers and each CD were calculated . This is the first time that the above mentioned model was applied to a multicomponent mixture of chiral compounds .
