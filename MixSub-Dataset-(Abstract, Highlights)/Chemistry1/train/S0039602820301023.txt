 The reactivity and structure of bimetallic nanoarrangements deposited on Au surfaces have been investigated on the basis of DFT . Several bimetallic nanostructures have been investigated wires and clusters with different Pd Pt ratios . Modifications in the material reactivity due to electronic chemical and geometrical effects were evaluated in terms of energetics charge redistribution and the densities of states projected onto the involved atoms to provide a deeper insight into the material behavior . Additionally we discussed the nanostructure reactivity for the hydrogen reaction by analysis of the behavior of the adsorbed intermediate H

@highlight The reactivity and structure of bimetallic wires and 2D clusters are studied.
@highlight Hydrogen adsorption is investigated on different ratios of Pd Pt nanostructures.
@highlight Hydrogen adsorption is more favored on Pt3 wire.
@highlight PdPt and Pt wires exhibit higher reactivity.
