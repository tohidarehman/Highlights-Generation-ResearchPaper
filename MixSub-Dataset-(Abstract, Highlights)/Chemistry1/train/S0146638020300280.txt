 Intertidal zones are the main sites for land ocean interaction and play an important role in transporting and accumulating organic carbon . Understanding sources and preservation of sedimentary OC are vital to better evaluate the processes controlling the OC distribution in intertidal zones . In this study we present bulk parameters of total organic carbon

@highlight Intertidal sediment OC contents increased with decreasing sediment grain size.
@highlight OC contents were higher in wet season than dry season mainly due to higher inputs.
@highlight Terrestrial OC contributions were higher in large estuaries than small estuaries.
@highlight Intertidal sediment carbon stocks were comparable to those in shelf sediments.
