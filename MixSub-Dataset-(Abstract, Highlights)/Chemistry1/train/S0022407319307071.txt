 The size and shape characterization of irregular particles is of great significance in the comprehensive understanding of many natural and industrial processes . The dual beam interferometric particle imaging technique is adapted from a dual beam backward illumination configuration of interferometric particle imaging to access the size and 2D shape of an irregular particle from its interferogram . An experimental setup combining the digital inline holography and DIPI techniques characterizes the same projection of the same particle with a color camera permitting the accuracy evaluation and validation between these two techniques . The comparison results show a good agreement between the 2D Fourier transform of DIPI interferogram and the 2D autocorrelation of DIH reconstructed in focus image . The DIH gives the reference result for the size measurement of the particles and we observe a maximum difference as low as 9 with the DIPI measurement . The backward arrangement of the dual beam interferometric particle imaging technique facilitates its further instrumental development and application to a variety of real circumstances e.g . solid fuel particles and ice crystals .
