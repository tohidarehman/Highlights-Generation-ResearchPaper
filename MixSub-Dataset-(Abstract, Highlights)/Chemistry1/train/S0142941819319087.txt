 In order to improve the interfacial adhesion between aramid fiber and rubber matrix the mercapto hyperbranched polysiloxane was grafted onto the AFs via a novel in situ growth strategy which combines the formation of polydopamine precursor layer and the co dehydration condensation between trimethoxysilane and trimethoxysilane . Based on the results of characterizations including morphology observations and chemical structure analyses the growth process of mercapto HPSi with the reaction time was investigated and discussed . The pull out force tests of AFs rubber composites which were carried out by universal testing machine showed that the modification strategy proposed in this study could increase the interfacial adhesion up to approximately 96.5 and the key factor could be inferred to be the covalent interaction between mercapto groups and double bonds . It is also worth mentioning that the phenomenon of excessive surface modification will occur with the overlong growth time which would result in the reduction of the interfacial adhesion .
