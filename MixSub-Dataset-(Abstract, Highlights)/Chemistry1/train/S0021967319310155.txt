 Gas chromatography and vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy are powerful and complementary techniques for the analysis of small molecules in forensics . Most notably flame ionization detection is commonly used with GC to identify and quantify volatile compounds . An FID s price point and ease of use makes it an attractive approach for routine laboratories that are in high demand for forensics analysis but with the contingency that an FID relies on retention time for identification and quantification . A new and innovative method using static headspace gas chromatography coupled with vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy was developed for the quantitative determination of ethanol in blood and identification of inhalants . This study investigates the possibility of using VUV as an alternative technique to traditional methods that use FID and mass spectrometry in toxicology and forensic analysis . VUV brings both identification and quantitation based on Beer Lambert s Law while using a simple single column solution . This paper investigates 25 compounds including ethanol methanol acetone benzene and toluene using a 130240nm wavelength range for identification and quantification using GC VUV even when coelutions occur . Ethanol was examined under a concentration range of 9 to 495mg dl and the method was found to be linear with an r
