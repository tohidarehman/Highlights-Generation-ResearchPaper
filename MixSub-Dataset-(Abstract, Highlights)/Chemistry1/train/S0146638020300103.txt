 3 Hydroxy fatty acids derived from Gram negative bacterial outer membranes have received recent attention for their potential as new terrestrial pH and temperature proxies for palaeoclimate studies . However it is not known whether 3 OH FA based proxies can be developed and applied to the marine environment . Here we analyze 3 OH FAs from a latitudinal transect of marine surface sediments from the North Pacific Ocean range of 28.11.3C . The results show that distributions of 3 OH FAs in marine sediments yield overall higher abundances of

@highlight Distinctive distributions of 3 OH FAs in marine surface sediments vs soils.
@highlight 16S rRNA analysis shows distinct bacterial populations in marine sediments.
@highlight We propose RAN
