 Non ionic surfactants such as polysorbates known as Tween 20 and Tween 80 are routinely used within the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry to enhance solubility . This work focuses on analysing the two aforementioned polysorbates each considered at three purity levels with four model compounds across the critical micellar concentration range for each surfactant . Such data is of interest to investigate the influence of micelle formation upon compound polysorbate interaction . Two analytical techniques were utilised namely spectroscopic solubility determination and micellar liquid chromatography . In all cases it was apparent that the maximum solubility for all four compounds increased substantially at concentrations greater than the CMC and that in most cases a different retention profile was observed using MLC once the CMC had been exceeded . This paper is the first to have used such techniques to investigate the behaviour of these polysorbates over a series of concentrations and three levels of polysorbate purity . The findings indicate that the solubilisation potential of polysorbates differs once the CMC has been surpassed and is dependent upon the level of purity selected i.e . compound surfactant interactions are partially a consequence of the presence of micelles rather than monomer as well as polysorbate purity . Thus formulators should include such polysorbates at optimised concentrations and purity if they wish to maximise their solubilisation potential .

@highlight Micellar liquid chromatography MLC was undertaken using polysorbates and four compounds.
@highlight Each compound displayed a different retention profile above the CMC.
@highlight The maximum solubility for the compounds increased substantially at concentrations greater than the CMC.
@highlight Solubilisation by polysorbates is dependent upon the level of polysorbate purity selected.
