 The present paper describes the thermal oxidation of a mixture applied as hot melt adhesive and particularly of its essential polymeric component ethylene propylene copolymer Licocene 2602 either virgin or grafted by acrylic acid . Chemiluminescence in oxygen under both nonisothermal and isothermal conditions was used as the tool for evaluation of oxidation stability of samples . The effect of various concentrations of stabiliser Naugard XL1 acting as a metal deactivator and phenolic antioxidant was also determined and the antioxidant selected was found to be an efficient thermooxidative stabiliser . The results appear to be of importance for practical multiple application of hot melt adhesives to be used for binding books .
