 Hindered amine light stabilizers are used to protect polymers from heat and light induced degradation . In this study the oligomeric stabilizer Tinuvin 622 was analysed in depth employing high performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry to differentiate products of different manufacturers in respect of their terminating groups and oligomer length . Additionally the behaviour of the stabilizer in uncured and cured polyester powder coatings was investigated regarding its interaction with the other coating components and chemical changes during the crosslinking process . The extraction efficiency was determined as a function of oligomer length and coating colour .

@highlight Novel analytical methods for characterization of the oligomeric hindered amine light stabilizer Tinuvin 622.
@highlight Differentiation of batches from different sources according to terminating groups and oligomer length.
@highlight Elucidation of the fate of Tinuvin 622 in cured and uncured polyester powder coatings.
@highlight Investigations of possible reactions of the stabilizer with crosslinker present in the investigated coatings.
