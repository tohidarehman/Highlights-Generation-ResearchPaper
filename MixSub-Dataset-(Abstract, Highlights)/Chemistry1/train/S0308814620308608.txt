 Cold pressed rapeseed meal with high protein content was used to prepare rapeseed protein isolates by alkaline extraction and acid precipitation . The protein with an intact structure and the highest yield was obtained at extraction pH 9.0 and precipitation pH 4.5 accompanied by the lowest D amino acid content the lightest colour and the lowest contents of glucosinolates phytic acid and sinapine . Additionally water oil absorption foaming and emulsifying capacities decreased with decreasing precipitation pH while the solubility showed the reverse trend . During gastric simulation digestion the polypeptide of cruciferin and napin in the RPIs showed digestive resistance . Overall pH regulation might be an effective method to isolate high quality RPIs for use in the food processing industry .

@highlight Protein extracted at pH 9.0 had lower glucosinolates phytic acid and sinapine.
@highlight Protein extracted at pH 9.0 had lighter colour and lower D amino acid content.
@highlight Protein obtained at pH 4.5 had the lowest glucosinolates phytic acid and sinapine.
@highlight Water oil absorption foaming and emulsifying features decreased as pH decreased.
@highlight The polypeptide of cruciferin and napin showed gastric digestive resistance.
