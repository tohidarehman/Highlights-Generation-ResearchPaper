 We have used gas chromatographic retention data together with other data to obtain Abraham descriptors for 30 terpene esters . These include the air water partition coefficient as log

@highlight Chromatographic data used to determine descriptors for terpene esters.
@highlight Descriptors then used to obtain physicochemical and environmental properties.
@highlight These include water solvent and air solvent partition coefficients.
@highlight These include human odor detection thresholds.
