 This review focuses on the existing analytical procedures for the determination of new psychoactive substances in biological fluids by chromatographic methods . Direct analysis of samples is scarcely employed and most proposed methodologies include a sample pre treatment in order to remove matrix interferents and in some cases pre concentrate extracts . Current extraction methods for NPS determination in plasma serum urine and oral fluids have been widely discussed such as liquid liquid solid phase and micro extraction approaches highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of the proposed extraction methodologies . Regarding microextraction approaches techniques like microextraction by packed sorbent solid phase microextraction miniaturized solid phase extraction and dispersive liquid liquid extraction have been proposed for NPS determination in biological fluids with reliable analytical results .

@highlight A rise in the occurrence of NPS has been observed in the last decade.
@highlight Sample preparation procedures for NPS determination in biological fluids have been reviewed.
@highlight Dilute and shoot LC MS analysis is scarcely employed for NPS analysis.
@highlight Microextraction is a mature methodology for routine determination of NPS in biofluids.
