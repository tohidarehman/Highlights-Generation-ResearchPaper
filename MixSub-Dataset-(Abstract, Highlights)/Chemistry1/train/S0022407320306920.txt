 We sketch the life and scientific legacy of Prof. Richard K. Chang 19402020 the Henry Ford II Professor of Applied Physics Professor of Physics and Electrical Engineering at Yale University . We briefly outline his research from linear and non linear optics light interactions with solids and liquids in various surface micro shapes and nano structures optical effects and processes in microresonators and later to laser spectroscopic characterization of sprays combustion and environmental pollutants . Prof. Chang has many colleagues collaborators students and friends among the JQSRT community .
