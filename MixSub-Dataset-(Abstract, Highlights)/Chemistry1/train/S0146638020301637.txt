 Mississippi valley type ore deposits are epigenetic carbonate hosted Pb Zn deposits that are formed by fluid expulsion from sedimentary sulfide successions . The sulfides were generated by thermochemical sulfate reduction of the evaporitic sulfates dissolved in fluids . The initiation processes and principles for TSR occurring in MVT ore deposition and the respective influence of major minerogenetic metal ions such as Pb

@highlight was simulated.
@highlight TSR occurred easily in the FeSO
@highlight experiments at 300C but hardly in the PbSO
@highlight experiments at 450C.
@highlight Fe
@highlight formation during the TSR is proposed to greatly accelerate the rate of TSR
@highlight Fe
@highlight is speculated to be significant for the initiation and acceleration of TSR in MVT ore deposit.
