 The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in aquatic systems has raised concern about their potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms . Considering the fact that the physiological biological effects of PPCPs are triggered when their concentrations in the organism exceeds the respective threshold values it is important to understand the bioconcentration and toxicokinetics of PPCPs in aquatic organisms . In the present study we developed a convenient analytical method for the determination of 65 pharmaceuticals and 7 personal care products log

@highlight A rapid analytical method was developed for 72 PPCPs in fish tissues.
@highlight Acidification with acetate buffer improved absolute recovery rates.
@highlight Oasis HLB and HybridSPE Phospholipid Ultra cartridges were assessed.
@highlight Zirconia coated silica cartridge efficiently removed analytical interferences.
@highlight The developed method is highly useful for comprehensive evaluation of PPCPs in fish.
