 In this investigation carbon fiber reinforced laminates with different orientation layups are prepared and studied under tensile loading condition . Multiple strain measurement techniques namely resistive strain gauges embedded optical sensors and digital image correlation are used to analyze stress strain behavior simultaneously through the thickness of composite materials and to determine the sequence of failure in different plies . Inconsistencies of strains measured through different methods is correlated with the tendency for interlaminar delamination therefore demonstrating the ability of multi instrument approach to describe damage progress through the thickness of multidirectional laminates . Complementary analysis through acoustic emission methods reveals that the angle of off axis surface plies can influence the sequence of failure under tensile loading condition and damage monitoring capabilities of acoustic emission system is directly affected by delamination tendency of surface plies . Remarkably the delayed failure of off axis plies is shown to be related to reorientation of these layer towards loading direction using infrared thermography method .
