 The main objective of this work was to report the mole fraction solubility of rutaecarpine in four binary solutions of methanol water isopropanol water acetone water and ethanol water acquired through the saturation shake flask technique . All experiments were conducted at temperatures from 283.15K to 323.15K . The maximum solubility was observed in the pure solvent of methanol ethanol isopropanol acetone for each solution . The achieved rutaecarpine solubility in mole fraction was mathematically described by two common co solvency models namely Jouyban Acree model and vant Hoff Jouyban Acree model . The calculated relative average deviations were no more than 6.78 and root mean square deviations no more than 23.6910
