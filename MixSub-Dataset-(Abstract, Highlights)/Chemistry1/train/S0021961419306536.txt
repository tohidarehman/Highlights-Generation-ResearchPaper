 Isothermal vapour liquid equilibrium data for the system has been measured at four temperatures from approximately 343K to 383K using a dynamic analytic apparatus . The densities of mixtures were also measured from 298K to 363K using an Anton Paar DMA 5000 densitometer . The vapour liquid phase equilibrium data were modelled by the

@highlight Data for excess properties at four temperatures toluene pyridine system has been measured.
@highlight The VLE data were modelled using the
@highlight approach.
@highlight The system exhibited azeotropy at all conditions measured.
@highlight The experimental density data were modelled by an empirical correlation.
