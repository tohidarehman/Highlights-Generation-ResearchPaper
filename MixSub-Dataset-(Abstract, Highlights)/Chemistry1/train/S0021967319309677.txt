 A direct procedure based on thermal desorption gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was developed for the fast extraction of seven polychlorinated biphenyls from sediments and soils . PCBs were directly extracted from 20 to 75mg of sample without any chemical pre treatment or use of organic solvents after the addition of 10L internal standard in acetone . Sample treatment was totally automated . PCBs were extracted at 250

@highlight TDGCMSMS has been proposed for the automated and direct extraction of PCBs from soil and sediment.
@highlight Extraction time and solvent consumption is assumed to be close to zero.
@highlight A certified reference material was analysed with comparable results.
@highlight Field sample results were comparable with those obtained by a reference extraction procedure.
@highlight Greenmetric evaluation of the proposed and conventional methods has been carried out.
