 During the last decades rising environmental concerns about the widespread usage of petroleum based synthetic polymers has caused naturally occurring polymers to gain momentous . As a biocompatible and environmentally friendly alternative bio based polymers are continuously gaining new domains of application in drug delivery systems tissue engineering membrane technology bio sensor devices etc . There is an increasing number of scientists who have applied various kinds of biopolymers such as cellulose chitin starch and alginate to fabricate fully or semi biodegradable membranes for wastewater treatment . Beside biocompatibility biopolymers combine many attractive features such as hydrophilicity and functionalizability that makes them great candidates to enhance the performance of composite membranes to effectively purify water from hazardous pollutants . On the other hand elevating thermo mechanical and chemical stability of these bio based materials by introducing new organic and inorganic additives is another main focus area . This review is concerned with 1 introducing the promising feature of biopolymers that can be used as a raw material to synthesize membranes for water treatment 2 proposing a comprehensive categorization of these membranes based on their structure and 3 discussing the performance of these membranes in eliminating various kinds of contaminants from effluents and their strength and weakness points .

@highlight The use of naturally occurring polymers either as the main body of or as filler to the membrane were reviewed.
@highlight Numbers of nanoscale fillers were incorporated in the host polymers synthetic or natural ones .
@highlight Cellulosic polymers chitin based polymers and other natural polymers were studied.
@highlight The first two are materials most abundant in nature while polymers in the third category are much less popular.
@highlight The use of natural polymeric membranes for environmental applications is encouraged.
