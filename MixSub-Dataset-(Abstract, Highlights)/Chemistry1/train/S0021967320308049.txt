 In this paper is reported a proof of concept study to evaluate the usage of a public metadata base about beers to guide chemical interpretation of volatile organic compounds profiling . 1 569 641 consumers evaluations were collected from Untappd platform and used to define a property of interest according to beer preference . 14 brands of beers from lager family were divided in two groups first one containing samples with low consumers ratings and the second with brands that exhibited high evaluations . VOC profiles were extracted by headspace solid phase microextraction and analyzed using comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry . To correlate the VOC profile and consumers preference unfolded partial least squares discriminant analysis with orthogonal signal correction were employed . The mathematical model successfully classified all the beer samples . Furthermore a template match protocol identified 31 compounds related to consumers preference . This proof of concept paper revealed the potential usage of public metadata bases for comprehensive chemical interpretation of VOC profiling in foodomics .

@highlight Data dependent analysis of beers using a public database of consumer preference.
@highlight U PLS DA classification of beer profiles based on their preference rating.
@highlight Consumers trends seems to be related to a more diversified VOC profile.
@highlight Opportunities to combine GCGC MS and machine learning in food industry.
