 Metal closures with a polymer based sealing for beer bottles have been known since the late nineteen sixties . However to what extent which parameter of the polymer sealing gasket plays a role in closure performance to keep the beer quality to a highest level possible is not fully understood . For this purpose three thermoplastic elastomer liners were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry Fourier transform infrared spectrometry dynamical mechanical analysis scanning electron microscopy and surface roughness in order to understand the effect of relative humidity and carbon dioxide CO

@highlight The effect of RH and CO
@highlight on physical and chemical properties of TPE liners under vibration frequencies was investigated.
@highlight Molding process optimization for each liner material is necessary.
@highlight High crystallinity in Liner C structure can be attributable to seal failure.
@highlight Liner A and B showed moisture and CO
@highlight  hardening behavior respectively due to relatively stronger covalent bond formation.
@highlight Liner C can leak during pasteurization and transportation due to a rougher surface and lack of resiliency.
