 The analysis of heparan sulfate disaccharides poses a real challenge both from chromatographic and mass spectrometric point of view . This necessitates the constant improvement of their analytical methodology . In the present study the chromatographic effects of solvent composition salt concentration and salt type were systematically investigated in isocratic HILIC WAX separations of heparan sulfate disaccharides . The combined use of 75 acetonitrile with ammonium formate had overall benefits regarding intensity detection limits and peak shape for all salt concentrations investigated . Results obtained with the isocratic measurements suggested the potential use of a salt gradient method in order to maximize separation efficiency . A 3 step gradient from 14mM to 65mM ammonium formate concentration proved to be ideal for separation and quantitation . The LOD of the resulting method was 0.81.5fmol for the individual disaccharides and the LOQ was between 2.55fmol . Outstanding linearity could be observed up to 2 pmol . This novel combination provided sufficient sensitivity for disaccharide analysis which was demonstrated by the analysis of heparan sulfate samples from porcine and bovine origin .
