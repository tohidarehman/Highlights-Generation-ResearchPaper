 Mesoporous structured molecularly imprinted polymers combined with restricted access materials were synthesized in this work then RAM M MIPs were used as adsorbents in matrix solid phase dispersion to extract chlorpyrifos residues from soil . The RAM M MIPs with mesoporous structure increased adsorptive capacity and accelerated adsorption rate . At the same time the RAM M MIPs with restricted access function showed good exclusion effect toward humic acid in the soil . In addition the characteristics of RAM M MIPs were measured and the optimal experimental conditions of MSPD were explored . In MSPD the extraction and clean up procedures can be finished simultaneously which saved the extraction time . The analyte eluted from soil was determined by LCMS MS . The recoveries were in the range of 93.5106.1 and the relative standard deviations were in the range of 2.85.7 at the spiked soil levels of 0.1010.00ngg
