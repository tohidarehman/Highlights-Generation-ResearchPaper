 Micellisation of a binary mixture of sodium deoxycholate and sodium cholate is examined for the aqueous solution without additives and for the aqueous solution containing methanol NaCl and methanol NaCl in the temperature range

@highlight In the temperature interval
@highlight  278.15298.15 for micelle SD SC in the aqueous solution synergistic interactions exist.
@highlight The impact of methanol from aqueous solution is expressed differently over
@highlight and
@highlight The effect of Na
@highlight ion is similar for both thermodynamic functions 
@highlight and
@highlight Thermodynamic stabilization of mixed micelle SD SC is the highest if aqueous solution contains methanol and Na
@highlight ions as well.
@highlight Novel thermodynamic functions are introduced for the thermodynamic stabilization of the binary mixed micelles.
