 Comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography based on flow modulation is gaining increasing attention as an alternative to thermal modulation the recognized GCGC benchmark thanks to its lower operational cost and rugged performance . An accessible rational procedure to perform method translation between the two platforms would be highly valuable to facilitate compatibility and consequently extend the flexibility and applicability of GCGC . To enable an effective transfer the methodology needs to ensure preservation of the elution pattern separation power and sensitivity . Here a loop type thermal modulation system with dual detection used for the targeted analysis of allergens in fragrances is selected as reference method . Initially six different columns configurations are systematically evaluated for the flow modulated counterpart . The set up providing the most consistent chromatographic separation 20m x 0.18mm
