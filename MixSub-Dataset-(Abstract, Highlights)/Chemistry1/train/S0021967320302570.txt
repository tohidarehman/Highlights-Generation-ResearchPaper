 New zwitterionic stationary phases are synthesized with the click and conventional bonding of tyrosine to silica gel . Infrared spectra and elemental analysis demonstrate the successful click and conventional bonding of this ZIC group on silica particles by the surface coverage including 2.36 and 0.75m

@highlight Formation of tri azo ring in stationary phase during click reaction leads to increase the polarity of stationary phase and partitioning portion in separation mechanism.
@highlight Compared to the commercial ZIC and bare silica SPs the Click Tyrosine SP provided better resolution and peak shape for narcotics.
@highlight Separation of vincristine and vinblastine was performed in less time in comparison to the reversed phase chromatography.
