 S and electronic states of strontium sulfide are characterized at the CASSCF MRCI Q level of theory . This is the first work to provide a reliable picture of the potential energy curves showing the challenges one might face to investigate them either theoretically or experimentally . Spectroscopic parameters and averaged dipole moment functions are reported . Einstein emission coefficients provide relevant information on the relative intensities for selected transitions . Radiative lifetimes are also estimated and an accurate value of dissociation energy for the ground state obtained . Perturbing states in the
