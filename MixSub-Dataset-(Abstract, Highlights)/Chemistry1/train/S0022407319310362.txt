 Topological insulator semiconductors hold unique electronic transport characteristics that allow them behave like graphene at the surface of the nanoscale thin film . Photonic multilayers consisting of alternating layers of topological insulator and layers of its dielectric spacer can be engineered to demonstrate optical and thermal radiative dispersion attributed to electromagnetic metamaterials . This paper presents case studies explain the relationships between material compositions geometrical factors spectral functions and electronic transport mechanisms to the overall visible to far infrared radiative properties . It shows how topological insulator multilayers could be useful in thermal photovoltaic components optoelectronic devices and radiative coatings . Two multilayer cases are investigated Bi
