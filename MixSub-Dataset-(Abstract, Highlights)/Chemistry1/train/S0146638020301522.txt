 We reconstructed the paleoenvironmental conditions of the Mazarrn Basin during MIS 7 and MIS 1 based on their alkane and fatty acid contents their mineralogy and the fossil content of an amino acid dated sediment sequence . The

@highlight Based on alkane indices three geochemical units GU were identified.
@highlight GUs represent major contribution of aquatic macrophytes or terrestrial plants.
@highlight Paleoenvironmental episodes PE produced oscillations in the marsh water level.
@highlight PEs were related to sea level and climatic changes and recent tectonics.
@highlight Emersion led to increased amounts of short chain and branched fatty acids.
