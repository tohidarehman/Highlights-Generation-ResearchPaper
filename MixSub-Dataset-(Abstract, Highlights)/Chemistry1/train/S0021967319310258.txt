 In this study a monolithic enzyme reactor based on a strategy of green synthesis was successfully prepared in a capillary with trypsin immobilized by thiol ene click reaction . A polymer of poly butyl methacrylate

@highlight IMER based on deep eutectic solvent was prepared by thiol ene click reaction.
@highlight Michaelis constants and maximum reaction rate were 2.1mM and 0.028mol min.
@highlight A rapid digestion of BSA on the IMER was 864 times faster than in solution digestion.
@highlight 1034 protein groups can be identified from protein extracts of rat liver by the IMER.
