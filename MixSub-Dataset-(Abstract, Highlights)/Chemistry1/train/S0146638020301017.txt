 Mangrove systems represent important long term sinks for carbon since they have much higher carbon burial rates than terrestrial forests or typical coastal ecosystems . However quantifying the sources of organic matter in estuarine and coastal sediments where mangroves occur but are not the only source of OM is challenging due to the variety of OM sources and diverse transport processes in these dynamic environments . The sources of OM in subtidal surface sediments of two mangrove fringed estuaries in Hainan Province China were investigated using the mangrove specific biomarker taraxerol and other lipid biomarkers as well as stable carbon isotopes . Mixing models based on the concentration of taraxerol plant wax

@highlight Taraxerol was used to quantify mangrove OM contribution in estuarine sediments.
@highlight Mangroves could contribute 1519 to sediment OM.
@highlight The mangrove OM fraction increased seaward due to offshore transport.
@highlight A higher terrestrial proportion of OM occurred in the wetter estuary.
