 The adsorption behavior of the model proteins alpha Lactalbumin Bovine Serum Albumin Lysozyme and a monoclonal antibody in single component and in binary mixtures was investigated on two different hydrophobic interaction chromatography resins using both static and dynamic methods . A kinetic model of the adsorption process was developed which accounted for protein unfolding and intermolecular interactions in the adsorbed phase . The latter incorporated positive cooperative interactions resulting from preferred and multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent surface as well as negative cooperative interactions attributed to exclusion effects due to size exclusion and repulsion . Cooperative adsorption resulted in negative or positive deviations from the Langmuir model for both single and multicomponent isotherms . The model was used to assess possible contributions of different adsorption mechanisms of proteins and their structurally different forms to the overall adsorption pattern as well as to simulate chromatographic band profiles under different loading conditions .

@highlight Single and competitive adsorption isotherms of proteins were measured on HIC media.
@highlight A kinetic model of protein adsorption was developed to describe protein adsorption behavior.
@highlight The model accounted for protein unfolding positive and negative cooperative adsorption.
@highlight The approach for correlation of static and dynamic binding of proteins in HIC was developed.
