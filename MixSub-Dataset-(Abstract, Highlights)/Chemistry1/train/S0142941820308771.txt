 In this study an experimental investigation is performed to observe the electromechanical response of CB Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene additive manufactured composite under quasi static and dynamic loading conditions for the potential damage sensing applications . Dog bone tensile double v notch shear and single edge notch bending specimen printed with three different configurations are considered for the quasi static condition . A modified split Hopkinson pressure bar along with high speed video camera is used for dynamic fracture experiments . Four point probe technique coupled with a high resolution data acquisition system is employed to obtain the real time electrical response . In the case of tensile loading 45 45 printed specimens show a nonlinear change of electrical resistance due to unique failure mode . Under the shear loading electrical resistance remains unchanged during the elastic deformation . After the damage evolution 45 45 printed specimens exhibit a higher rate of change in electrical resistance due to alignment of the filaments along the maximum principle shear stress direction . For both static and dynamic fracture loading a minimal change of electrical resistance is observed before crack initiation . However after the crack initiation a sharp change of electrical resistance for 0 90 printed specimens indicates a faster crack propagation as compared to the 45 45 printed specimens .
