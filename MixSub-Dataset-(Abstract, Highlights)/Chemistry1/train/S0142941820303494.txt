 Self reinforced composites are polymeric materials formed by a reinforcement core and a low melting point skin which acts as a matrix after the consolidation step . These materials are widely exploited in industrial applications for their mechanical resistance and durability which are themselves influenced by processing conditions and polymer composition . In the present work two similar polypropylene based commercial fabrics were used to evaluate the surface modifications after laminate compaction and after artificial aging using atomic force microscopy . The results were correlated with the chemical and physical chemical interactions obtained from scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy raman and thermal analysis experiments . Single tape consolidated laminate before and after aging displayed different superficial features that can explain the differences in the macroscopic behavior of the two products .

@highlight 2 commercial SRCs with the same number of tapes in warp and weft direction were studied.
@highlight SRC type P skin is not only copolymer but blend with PE that crystalizes in spherulites.
@highlight SRC type T skin is a copolymer well adherent to the stretched iPP core and no spherulites.
@highlight Manufacturing process and the skin composition produce different morphologies.
@highlight The aging causes a chain breaking dissimilar for the two materials.
