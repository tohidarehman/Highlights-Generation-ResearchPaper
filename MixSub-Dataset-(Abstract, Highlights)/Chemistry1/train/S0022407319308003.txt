 Kirchhoff s law relates the emittance and absorptance of an object and has played an important role in radiative heat transfer calculations for many engineering applications . Along with the advancement of metamaterials two dimensional materials and micro nanoscale thermal radiation Kirchhoff s law has been revisited by several groups . Some studies also questioned the derivations and applicability of the statement of Kirchhoff s law that appears in prevalent radiative heat transfer textbooks . The present study begins with a short review of Kirchhoff s law for isotropic objects and its validity for both hemispherical emittance and directional emittance . Then this study formulates Kirchhoff s law for opaque anisotropic materials considering both co polarization and cross polarization and then for semitransparent films . It is shown that for macroscopic objects as long as the Helmholtz reciprocity can be established conventional expressions of Kirchhoff s law can be applied for engineering thermal analysis and design even with anisotropic media and metamaterials . Numerical examples and results are provided based on a natural hyperbolic material and a magneto optical material to illustrate the reciprocity and applicability of Kirchhoff s law .
