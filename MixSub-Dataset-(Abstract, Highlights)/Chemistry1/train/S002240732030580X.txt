@highlight Excitation energies and lifetimes for the lowest 236 fine structure levels of Zr XXXV are calculated.
@highlight Wavelengths transition rates weighted oscillator strengths and line strengths for E1 M1 E2 and M2 transitions of Zr XXXV are calculated.
@highlight The calculations are performed using the fully relativistic multiconfiguration Dirac Hartree Fock MCDHF method.
@highlight The present MCDHF energies wavelengths and electric dipole oscillator strengths are compared with other available theoretical results.
