 Accurate spectroscopic modeling is critical when measuring time resolved state specific chemical kinetics of diatomic molecules . Here a spectroscopic model was developed to accurately simulate oxygen absorption cross sections in the Schumann Runge system for non equilibrium conditions . Cross sections of shock heated oxygen O
