 Macrolides are versatile broad spectrum antibiotics whose activity stems from the presence of a macrolide ring . They are widely used in veterinary medicine to prevent and treat disease . However because of their improper use and the absence of effective regulation these compounds pose a threat to human health and the environment . Consequently simple quick economical and effective techniques are required to analyze macrolides in animal derived foods biological samples and environmental samples . This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the pretreatment and analytical methods used for macrolides in various sample matrices focusing on the developments since 2010 . Pretreatment methods mainly include liquid liquid extraction solid phase extraction matrix solid phase dispersion and microextraction methods . Detection and quantification methods mainly include liquid chromatography electrochemical methods capillary electrophoresis and immunoassays . Furthermore a comparison between the pros and cons of these methods and prospects for future developments are also discussed .

@highlight Progress in microextraction technology and online technology are introduced.
@highlight The evolution and advance of HRMS analyzers are in detailed.
@highlight Advantages and applications of electrochemical methods are presented.
@highlight The future perspective for newly emerged eco friendly methods are discussed.
