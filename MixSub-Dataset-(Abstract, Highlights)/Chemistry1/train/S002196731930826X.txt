 A simple rapid and sensitive ultra high performance liquid chromatography with charged aerosol detector method was developed for firstly simultaneous determination of seven oligosaccharides including two pairs of linear oligosaccharides isomers and 3 high branched oligosaccharides as well as sucrose in

@highlight Oligosaccharides in
@highlight were firstly analyzed.
@highlight UPLC CAD was developed for analysis of these oligosaccharides.
@highlight The peaks of oligosaccharides were also identified by UPLC QTOF MS MS method.
@highlight The developed method was used to evaluate the quality of
