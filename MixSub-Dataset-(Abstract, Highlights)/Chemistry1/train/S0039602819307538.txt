 Density functional theory calculations have been performed to determine the adsorption mechanism of Pt sub monolayer on the positive BiFeO

@highlight The adsorption of Pt on positive BFO 0001 surface is different for 1 2ML and 1 2ML.
@highlight For 1 2ML there is only one type of Pt adatom which is binding directly with the low lying O anion.
@highlight For 1 2ML another type of Pt adatom can be identified with distinct adsorption configuration and electronic states.
@highlight At 1ML the surface magnetic order shows ferromagnetic structure instead of antiferromagnetic arrangement.
@highlight The two types of Pt imply the possibility to enhance catalytic efficiency at the Pt adsorbed BFO 0001 positive surface.
