 The micro flowing water system can improve the flesh quality of freshwater fish using the traditional pond farming method . However the mechanism of this phenomenon has not yet been explored . This study intends to examine the changes of metabolites in freshwater fish after treatment with the micro flowing purification system . The UPLC QTOF MS based metabolomics method was utilized to screen the metabolites and predict the major possible metabolic pathways after MFPS treatment . There were 377 types of metabolites identified in the fish muscle of which 5471 represented significant different metabolites identified during different stages of MFPS treatments . The main mechanism of MFPS treatment in improving the quality of grass carp fish muscle was investigated and the MFPS treatment was shown to improve the flesh quality and the flavor of grass carp fish muscle . This study could provide the theoretical basis for improving the quality of aquatic products .
