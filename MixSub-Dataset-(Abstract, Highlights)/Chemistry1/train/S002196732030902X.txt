 In this work a hydroxyl containing porous organic framework was prepared by a simple solvothermal reaction with 1 4 phthalaldehyde and phloroglucinol as monomers . Sol gel method was used to coat HC POF on the glass stir bar . The prepared HC POF coated stir bar shows better extraction performance for six triazole fungicides compared to commercial polydimethylsiloxane and ethylene glycol silicone coated stir bars . Fourier transform infrared Spectrometry and X ray photoelectron Spectrometry were used to explore interactions between HC POF coating and TFs . It is assumed that the coating mainly adsorbs TFs through interactions hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions . Based on this fact a new method of HC POF coated stir bar sorptive extraction combined with high performance liquid chromatography diode array detector was developed for the determination of six TFs in grape and cabbage samples . A series of extraction and desorption conditions were carefully optimized including salt concentration sample solution pH stirring rate and desorption solvent . Under the optimized experimental conditions the proposed method displayed limits of detection in the range of 0.022 0.071 g L
