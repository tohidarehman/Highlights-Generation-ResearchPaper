 It is necessary to establish a rapid simple and environmentally friendly detection method for benzoylurea pesticides in environmental water samples because of their toxicity in environmental circulation . Herein a novel polyethylene glycol modified magnetic covalent organic framework material based on the Schiff base reaction was prepared PEG Fe

@highlight This material PEG Fe
@highlight @SNW 1 was used in magnetic solid phase extraction for the first time.
@highlight PEG 600 modified magnetic nanoparticles could decrease the aggregation rate and improve the chemical stability.
@highlight Sufficient accuracy precision and sensitivity of the proposed method were achieved for detecting benzoylurea pesticides.
