 During stoppers production large amounts of cork by products are generated being used as low value material . This project aims to turn CBPs into smart natural and sustainable materials for solid phase extraction of pesticides from water . The study describes the use of CBPs for the extraction of 17 fungicides followed by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis . The most critical parameters affecting SPE were optimized by experimental design methodology . Under the optimal conditions the method was successfully validated in terms of linearity repeatability and intermediate precision . Fungicide recovery was assessed in different real water samples including river fountain rainwater and spring water at 3 concentration levels 0.1 0.5 and 10 g L

@highlight For the first time the use of cork by products CBPs is proposed for fungicide extraction.
@highlight The most critical parameters affecting SPE were optimized by experimental design.
@highlight The proposed method was validated for 17 common use fungicides in environmental water.
@highlight Water samples collected in vineyards revealed the presence of fungicides at g L
@highlight CBPs is an efficient low cost green ecofriendly alternative for fungicide analysis.
