 A detailed computer simulation study of the isotachophoretic migration and separation of norpseudoephedrine stereoisomers for cases with the neutral selector added to the leader immobilized to the capillary wall or support or partially present in the separation column is presented . The electrophoretic transport of the analytes from the sampling compartment into the separation medium with the selector the formation of a transient mixed zone the separation dynamics of the stereoisomers with a free or immobilized selector the dependence of the leader pH the ionic mobility of norpseudoephedrine the complexation constant and selector immobilization on steady state plateau zone properties and zone changes occurring during the transition from the chiral environment into a selector free leader are thereby visualized in a hitherto unexplored way . For the case with the selector dissolved in the leading electrolyte simulation data are compared to those observed in experimental setups with coated fused silica capillaries that feature minimized electroosmosis and zone detection with conductivity and absorbance detectors .
