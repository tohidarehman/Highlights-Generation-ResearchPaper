 This report investigates the adsorption of monolayers of X at silicene and the dynamical stability of the system . Based on the density functional theory calculations it is shown that X atoms bond strongly with the substrate giving rise to new XSi hybrid states which results in preferred surface configurations of

@highlight Tl Pb and Bi wet the surface of silicene.
@highlight 1 and
@highlight 1 are predicted stable at 200K.
@highlight 1 is predicted stable at 500K.
@highlight All adsorption systems are metal with giant spin splitting GSS of metallic bands.
@highlight 1 monolayer ML of Pb gives rise to a significantly larger GSS at silicene than 1 16 ML.
