 In general the simultaneous separation and isolation of compounds with a broad polarity range from natural products is a challenge by ordinary high speed counter current chromatography . Indeed the complex solvent system screening methods limit the broader application of HSCCC . We describe herein a rapid and efficient linear gradient CCC method that enables the separation of flavonoid glycosides with a broad range of

@highlight Linear gradient CCC was developed to separate broad range of
@highlight value compounds.
@highlight Inner recycling CCC was further used for the compounds with similar
@highlight values.
@highlight Ethyl acetate 
@highlight  butanol water solvent system is simple for LGCCC separation.
