 Deposition of Au on vicinal Si surfaces results in the self assembly of one dimensional Au atomic wires . Charge transfer from the Au wire to the Si step edge leads to a chain of Si dangling bond orbitals with a long range ordered threefold periodicity along the steps and finite interchain interaction perpendicular to the steps . Employing spot profile analysis low energy electron diffraction we observed a broadening of spot width with time indicative for the degradation of Si dangling bond chain and Au wire length . We introduce a new mechanism how adsorbates act as origin for this degradation beyond the intuitive picture of bond saturation . Here zero dimensional anti phase translational domain boundaries are generated which immediately destroy the long range order along and perpendicular to the steps respectively . From the temporal evolution of the decreasing coherence length we conclude that the Au wires are less reactive to adsorption than the Si dangling bond chains .
