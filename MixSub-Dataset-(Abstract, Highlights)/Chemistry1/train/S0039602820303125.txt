 Reaction networks calculated using density functional theory play a crucial role in understanding and predicting heterogeneous catalyst performance . However results obtained using different density functionals can vary significantly . Accordingly it is important to assess the accuracy of available functionals in capturing adsorption energetics derived from single crystal adsorption microcalorimetry experiments . Here we evaluate how different density functionals describe the molecular and dissociative adsorption of CH

@highlight Enthalpies of adsorption for CH
@highlight I CH
@highlight  I H and CH
@highlight dissociation on Ni 111 are calculated.
@highlight Results from different density functionals are compared to experiments.
@highlight Each adsorption process is described accurately by at least one functional.
@highlight Within experimental error no functional is accurate for describing all adsorption processes studied.
