 The natural extracellular matrix possessed varying biomechanical properties which played important roles in the dynamic cellular microenvironment . However for the conventional bone tissue engineering scaffolds stretchability and shape memory property were normally absent . Thus the behaviors of responsive changes required in dynamic physiological settings were unsatisfactory . Herein a series of conductive polyurethane shape memory elastomers were synthesized which based on conductive amino capped aniline trimer isophorone diisocyanate and poly . The conductive elastomers possessed high elasticity and flexibility especially the breaking elongation of copolymer with 15 AT content was up to 57056 . The mechanical properties of elastomers could be adjusted by regulating the content of AT in copolymers . The conductive elastomers exhibited excellent shape fixity ratio and good shape recovery ability at 37C . The electrical conductivity of elastomers was measured via the standard van der Pauw four probe method . They were all around 10

@highlight The conductive elastomers PCL IPDI AT were synthesized through a one pot step growth addition polymerization reaction.
@highlight The electrical conductivity of elastomers was all around 10
@highlight S cm and similar to that in human physiological environments.
@highlight The conductive elastomers with 15 AT content exhibited well mechanical properties and good shape recovery ability at 37 .
@highlight The conductive copolymer exhibited excellent cytocompatibility demonstrated by the viability and proliferation results.
@highlight The conductive copolymer combining with ES could synergistically promote the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3 E1 cells.
