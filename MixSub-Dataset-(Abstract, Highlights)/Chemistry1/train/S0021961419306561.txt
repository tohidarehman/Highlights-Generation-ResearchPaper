 In this paper a new type of double network composite hydrogel adsorbent with good mechanical properties was synthesized using calcium alginate graphene oxide and acrylic acid . The physical and chemical characteristics of DNC hydrogels were characterized by FTIR TGA XPS SEM . The adsorption properties and adsorption mechanism of Cd

@highlight A double network composite gel was successfully synthesized.
@highlight The gel has a fast adsorption rate for Cd
@highlight and a good adsorption effect.
@highlight The gel has good mechanical properties and can be easily separated and reused.
@highlight The adsorption behavior was discussed in detail.
