 Polymer blends are produced to achieve properties that pure polymers are unable to . The qualitative analysis of these blends is not always satisfactory to point out failures in the final product and therefore the determination of their content might be required . The aim of this study is to develop quantitative methodologies using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reflection mode with the universal attenuated total reflectance accessory and transmission techniques for the determination of the content of each polymer present in the polymer blend poly and polycarbonate . FT IR UATR presented better results using the relative band A

@highlight Polymer blends are produced to achieve properties that pure polymers are unable to.
@highlight The qualitative analysis of blends is very important to point out failures in the final product.
@highlight Quantitative methods were developed using FT IR in the MIR region by reflection UATR and transmission.
@highlight The relative bands A1772 A1716 PC PBT were used in both methodologies the best result was the reflection method UATR .
@highlight The FT IR UATR error was 2.30 slightly above the precision limit 2 but the methodology is accurate.
