 This paper describes an experimental study of the long term sealing performance of nitrile rubber joints on a manned deep ocean submersible operating down to 6000m depths . An initial formulation showing large compression set is discussed first . Then results from long term laboratory testing of a second formulation aged in water for 10 years are presented . Much lower compression set and higher sealing forces are observed . Based on these results a testing methodology for the prediction of the long term sealing performance of nitrile O rings is proposed . Results from laboratory tests are compared with those measured on joints aged for up to 10 years in service .

@highlight Compression tests performed after immersion over a period of 10 years are reported.
@highlight A laboratory prediction methodology for long term sealing behavior is described.
@highlight Relationship established between compression set and sealing force 
@highlight Leakage criterion proposed.
