 This study proposed the developed of a molecularly imprinted polymer for the extraction and determination of condensed tannins from the barks of Red Angico

@highlight MIP was successfully used to concentrate tannins in natural sources.
@highlight An effective methodology for tannins extraction has been developed.
@highlight Molecularly imprinted polymers were evaluated as SPE extraction phase.
@highlight MISPE was used for tannins concentration from Jabuticaba Umbu and Angico.
