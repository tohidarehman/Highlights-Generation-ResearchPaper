 Multi spectral imaging radiometry of the night sky provides essential information on light pollution and sky quality . However due to the different spectral sensitivity of the devices used for light pollution measurement the comparison of different surveys is not always trivial . In addition to the differences between measurement approaches there is a strong variation in natural sky radiance due to the changes of airglow . Thus especially at dark locations the classical measurement methods fail to provide consistent results . In this paper we show how to make better use of the multi spectral capabilities of commercial digital cameras and show their application for airglow analysis . We further recommend a novel sky quality metric the Dark Sky Unit based on an easily usable and SI traceable unit . This unit is a natural choice for consistent digital camera based measurements . We also present our camera system calibration methodology for use with the introduced metrics .

@highlight We present a new recommendation for a metric and its unit for dark sky quality measurements. The system is SI traceable and can be implemented by using digital cameras.
@highlight It is recommended to use band averaged radiance as a primary measure of night sky quality. The natural unit is nW m
@highlight  sr nm.
@highlight Digital camera based three colour radiance measurements give an optimal way for sky brightness measurements.
