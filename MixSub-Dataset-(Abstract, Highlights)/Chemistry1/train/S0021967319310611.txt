 A microextraction technique termed promoted reaction microextraction based on a liquid liquid microextraction was developed by applying a chemical reaction for promoting the extraction of the analytes into the extracting solvent . PRME is a very simple rapid and high performance method for extraction and pre concentration of organic compounds from water samples . In PRME different types of chemical reactions can be used . In the present work an acid base reaction that produces a gaseous product is employed . In this method appropriate amounts of auxiliary solvent acidic promotor and extraction solvent were added rapidly into a water sample containing a basic promotor . After adding the solution containing the acidic promoter to the water sample containing the basic promoter the acid base reaction started with high intensity . The reaction product consisted of salt water and carbon dioxide gas . The produced carbon dioxide generated bubbles in the reaction medium that promoted the extraction of the analytes into the extracting solvent . After centrifuging the fine particles of the extraction solvent were sedimented in the bottom of the conical tube . The denes phase was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry . Several parameters affecting the extraction of 17 target pesticides by PRME GC MS were investigated . Under the optimum conditions the calibration graph was linear in the range of 0.03540.0gL

@highlight A simple rapid and high performance pre concentration is represented.
@highlight The pretreatment involves a LLME in which a gas generation reaction occurs.
@highlight The produced gas bubbles from acid base reaction promote the transfer of the analytes onto the extracting phase.
@highlight The PRME allows the simultaneous quantification of pesticides from water samples.
@highlight No devices or equipment was needed.
