 Sorptive extraction techniques have experienced increased popularity but they face limitations in dynamic range and sensitivity . In this study a new method combining stir bar sorptive extraction and thin film solid phase microextraction was developed and optimization for extraction temperature and time was carried out . Polydimethylsiloxane coated SBSE and PDMS carboxen coated TFSPME were used and both headspace and direct immersion extraction modes were also studied . Using 40 selected volatile compounds the combined method generally gave a wider linearity range with lower minimum limits satisfactory coefficient of determination R

@highlight Incorporation of SBSE and TFSPME into a single extraction workflow.
@highlight Optimization of extraction temperature and time for six different extraction methods.
@highlight Improved linearity range sensitivity and recoveries for the combined method.
@highlight Successfully extracted 40 compounds with various chemical and physical properties.
