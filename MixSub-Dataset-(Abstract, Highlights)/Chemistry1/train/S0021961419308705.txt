 Ionic liquids start to leave the position of novel and astonishing compounds and become commercially available in a relatively high purity . Consequently their thermodynamic properties should be described in a more thorough way than in the times of first pioneering studies revealing the importance of the water content . Available thermodynamic data however contradict this assumption keeping large discrepancies even among the data published in the most recent papers . Eight common ionic liquids based on the 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium cation C

@highlight Phase behaviour and heat capacities of eight C
@highlight Im ionic liquids are studied calorimetrically.
@highlight Special attention is payed to drying of the samples and evaluation of the effect of water content.
@highlight Calorimetric results are critically compared with the literature data proving superior purity and lower uncertainty.
