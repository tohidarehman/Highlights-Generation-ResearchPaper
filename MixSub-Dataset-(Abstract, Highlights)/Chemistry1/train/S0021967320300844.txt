 This work extends the present working range of isotachophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection and describes for the first time a functional cationic electrolyte system for analyses at medium alkaline pH . So far no ITPMS application was published on the analysis of medium strong bases although there is a broad spectrum of potential analytes like biogenic amines alkaloids or drugs where this technique promises interesting gains in both sensitivity and specificity . The presented results include a selection of suitable sufficiently volatile ESI compatible system components discussion of factors affecting system properties and recommendations for functional ITP electrolyte systems . Theoretical conclusions based on calculations and computer simulations are confirmed by experiments with a model mixture of beta blockers . Practical applicability of the method is demonstrated on the example of analysis of sotalol in dried blood spots where direct injection of aqueous extract ITP stacking and MS detection provide a fast simple and sensitive technique with limits of quantitation on the sub nM level .
