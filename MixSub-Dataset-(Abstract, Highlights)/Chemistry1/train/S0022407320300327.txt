 Light matter interaction in all dielectric nanoparticles has attracted more attention because of the ability to control and configure light scattering on high index nanoparticles . In the framework of the discrete dipole approximation we theoretically applied cartesian multipole expansion to a periodic array of nanoparticles . This allows to analyze the contribution of multipole moments including toroidal moments in the scattering spectra of an array of infinite 1D 2D periodic structure of arbitrary shaped nanoparticles . The formulation is based on the Taylor expansion in cartesian coordinate system up to the fifth order that includes a magnetic 16 pole and an electric 32 pole . Examples of a wide band reflector and a wide band transmitter made of silicon nanodisks are studied at IR wavelengths . The results show how constructive and destructive interferences of multipole terms affect the scattering field . The proposed method paves the way to design and analyzenovel types of nanoscale subwavelength metasurfaces .
