 The small angle approximation is used in solving the radiative transfer equation when the single scattering phase function has a strong forward peak . The original vector radiative transfer equation is decomposed into three equations the forward the regular and the correction ones . The forward equation can be efficiently solved using the small angle approximation . The solution of the regular equation is given by the adding doubling method in this study .
