 Nanocomposites based on graphene oxide hexagonal boron nitride and their hybrid GO h BN as nanofillers in polyurethane were prepared and their structures and morphologies were studied . The efficient production of a few layers of nanofillers was completed using the direct liquid phase exfoliation process . Mechanical and thermal tests were carried out to study the effect of the addition of GO h BN and GO h BN at different wt in the PU system . The tensile strength and Young s modulus showed an increase of up to 85 and 140 respectively for the composite containing 0.5wt of the hybrid GO h BN mixture . An impressive improvement of up to 1450 in thermal conductivity was observed for the same sample when compared to neat polymer . In order to gain further insights regarding the mechanism behind the nanofiller dispersion and adhesion processes in PU fully atomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out . Based on these simulations it was possible to build structural models that help to explain the thermal and mechanical improvements in the hybrid GO h BN composites with a focus on its stabilization energy .
