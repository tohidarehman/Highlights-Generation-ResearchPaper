 Lignocellulosic fibers extracted from sugarcane bagasse were treated with NaOH solutions of different concentration to study the effect of alkali treatment on the composition structure and properties of the fibers . Composition was determined by the van Soest method structure was characterized by X ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy while mechanical properties by tensile testing . Hemicellulose and lignin content decrease while cellulose content goes through a maximum as a function of alkali concentration . Crystallinity changes only slightly and microfibril angle remains constant thus structural effects and especially MFA are not the primary reasons for changing properties . The Young s modulus of the fibers shows a slight maximum at around 2 4wt NaOH content while tensile strength goes through a much more pronounced one at around 5 8wt . Direct correlation between structure and mechanical properties was not found indicating that composition is more important in the determination of properties than structure . Regression analysis proved that the combination of several compositional variables determines mechanical properties in a non linear manner . The improvement in fiber properties was explained with the dissolution of weak amorphous fractions and the relative increase of cellulose content .
