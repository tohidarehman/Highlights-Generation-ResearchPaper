 Herein the effect of twist on physical properties such as tensile hairiness and wicking behavior of our reported tri component elastic conductive composite yarns was systematically studied . Experimental results revealed that an optimum twist value provided the maximum yarn strength . A positive relation between extension at break and twist was observed . Significant differences in the tensile behavior is established . Two parameter Weibull distribution and boxplots were used to quantify the variation in yarn strength . The role of spinning geometry and variation in twists on hair formation was highlighted with an increase in twist reducing yarn hairiness . In addition t ECCYs with higher twist exhibited poorer wickability and there was a gradual increase of the equilibrium height of yarn under extension . Importantly the results demonstrated that the Laughlin Davies wicking model was valid for t ECCYs under tested conditions . It is promising that the as fabricated t ECCYs is prerequisite for the next wave of smart yarns and large scale stretchable protective devices such as superstretchable helical structured yarn heaters and elastic electromagnetic shielding fabrics .
