 The Co Ti binary system has been investigated by means of experimental measurements and thermodynamic calculations . In order to provide new phase relationship in the Co Ti system 9 key alloys were prepared by arc melting under vacuum . All alloys were examined for phase and composition analysis by means of X ray diffraction and electron probe microanalysis after annealing at 900C for 60days and 1000C for 30days respectively . The invariant equilibrium among liquid L1

@highlight Experimental clarify the invariant eutectic equilibrium among liquid C36 and L1
@highlight Thermodynamic optimization of Co Ti system.
@highlight Scheil solidification simulation was employed to analyze the experimental microstructure of as cast alloys.
@highlight Good agreement between calculation and experimental data is reached.
