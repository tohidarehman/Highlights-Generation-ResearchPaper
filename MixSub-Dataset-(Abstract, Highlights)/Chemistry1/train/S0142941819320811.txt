 Injectable hydrogel is a kind of in situ gelling system but has its specificity on the process procedure which requires a better control of gelation kinetics . Hydrogels with injectability under mild condition are preferred in the field of biomedicine especially for drug delivery and tissue engineering because of the favorable carrier property in three dimension biocompatibility low invasive and adaptable shape for administration . Despite the advantages the development of injectable hydrogels may also face some challenges to meet the various clinical requirements . In this review we provide a brief summary on the recent progresses on the design synthesis and evaluation of injectable hydrogels towards biomedical applications .
