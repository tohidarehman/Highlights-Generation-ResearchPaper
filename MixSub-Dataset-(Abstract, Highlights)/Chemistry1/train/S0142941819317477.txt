 In this paper axial and radial compression tests of carbon fiber epoxy filament wound shape memory polymer composite tubes were carried out to investigate the corresponding mechanical response . Carbon fibers impregnated with epoxy resin matrix were wound with 45 layers . The effects of temperature compression times defect hole area shape and distribution on the mechanical properties of composite tubes were studied and analyzed respectively . Meanwhile the mechanical model of stress distribution about the defect hole under axial compression loading was established via using the method of complex function . Furthermore the failure factors of specimens were analyzed . As a result the defect with sharp angle would result in lower buckling load and Young s modulus . In addition the failure area where the delamination of materials was predominantly located in the middle of specimen . The more times of compression to failure would result in the lower buckling load and Young s modulus of specimens and the relationship was mainly in form of a specific power function . According to Hashin failure criteria the effect of axial compression times on buckling load and equivalent modulus was investigated .

@highlight The relationship between the compression times and the equivalent modulus was found through the experimental method of compression and reheating of the samples prepared by winding method.
@highlight The influence of different defect factors on sample strength and equivalent modulus was determined by machining different shapes and numbers of defect holes on the pipe wall.
@highlight Through a variety of testing methods the microstructure of the sample when it failed was understood.
@highlight The functional relationship between compression times and strength was established by fitting.
@highlight Based on the previous studies the failure criteria of shape memory polymer composites are modified.
