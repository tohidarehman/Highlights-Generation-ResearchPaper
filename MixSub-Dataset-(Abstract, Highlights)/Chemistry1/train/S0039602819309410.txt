 Binding of functionalized organic molecules to oxide surfaces is an important step in the rational design of molecular devices . In the present investigation we used synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy and near edge X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy to determine the binding mode electronic structure and adsorption geometry of phenylphosphonic acid on TiO

@highlight Temperature dependent bonding mode of phenylphosphonic acid on TiO
@highlight  110 380520K monodentate binding mode 520780K mixed bidentate binding mode.
@highlight Multilayer desorption at 380K and stable monolayer up to at least 780K.
@highlight Change in binding mode leaves adsorption angle and the molecular electronic structure mainly unchanged.
