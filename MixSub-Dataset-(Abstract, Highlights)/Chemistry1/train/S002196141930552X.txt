 The accurate knowledge of the saturation vapor pressure of liquid water and ice has a great importance in a host of applications where humidity measurements are involved since it enables the correct conversion among different physical quantities that quantify the water vapor amount of a humid gas mixture .

@highlight New measurements of the saturation vapor pressure of supercooled liquid water along the saturation line are reported.
@highlight Measurements are carried out in a temperature range where the availability of experimental data in the literature is limited.
@highlight Measurements are traceable to the SI units.
@highlight An accurate evaluation of the measurement uncertainty is provided.
@highlight The comparison with literature data and known formulations is commented.
