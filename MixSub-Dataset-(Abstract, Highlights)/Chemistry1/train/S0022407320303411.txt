 We present a comprehensive study on the temperature dependent mid infrared absorption spectra between 8.4m and 11.7m for a complete list of C

@highlight Employed a broad scan rapid tuning EC QCL for the collection of high temperature absorption spectra in a shock tube.
@highlight Validated the experimental procedure with room temperature nitrogen diluted static spectra measurements at one atmosphere.
@highlight Reported the absorption spectra for propene 1 butene cis trans 2 butene isobutene and 1 3 butadiene between 8.411.7m and 6001000K
@highlight Found good agreement between the measured spectra and absorption predictions from cross section correlations in the literature.
@highlight Efficiently expanded upon existing spectroscopic knowledge of mid infrared absorption at combustion related conditions.
