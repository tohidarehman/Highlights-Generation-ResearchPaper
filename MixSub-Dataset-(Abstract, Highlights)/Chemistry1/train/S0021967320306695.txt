 The selective extraction and column separation rear earth elements were investigated in the present work . Herein the functional ligand of N N dioctyldiglycolic acid was synthesized and chemically grafted on the silica gel particles to give the novel material

@highlight Novel solid phase extraction material for extracting rare earth elements REEs .
@highlight Good adsorption capacity high efficiency with rapid adsorption kinetics within 100min and significant adsorption capacity 126.33mg g .
@highlight Applied for preliminary separation of REEs.
