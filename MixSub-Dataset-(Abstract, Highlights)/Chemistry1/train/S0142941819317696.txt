@highlight The Magnesium sulfate whiskers MOSw were first modified by Stearic acid or Si69 and Natural rubber NR modified MOSw composites were prepared by blending the modified MOSw with natural rubber latex.
@highlight By adding modified MOS
@highlight into NR the mechanical properties the anti ultraviolet aging property flammability and thermal stability of composites were improved obviously.
