 Prostaglandins are vitally important unsaturated fatty acids involved in arachidonic acid metabolism participating in numerous pathophysiological processes especially in maintaining the homeostasis of uterus . Therefore quantitative analysis of PGs is of great importance for uncovering potential mechanisms of PGs related diseases . However methods for determining PGs in uterine samples have not been reported . In this study an ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was established to quantify PGs in uterine samples using N N Dimethylethylenediamine and N N Diethylethylenediamine as derivatization reagents . The derivatization could be finished at 37C for 30min catalyzed by 1 N N N N Tetramethyl O uronium hexafluorophosphate . This is a mild condition suitable for most of biological samples . The DMED labeling of PGs could significantly enhance their response compared to those of underived ones . This method exhibited excellent linearity R

@highlight The derivation of PGs by DMED have high derivation efficiency under mild condition.
@highlight PGs derivatized with DEED can be used as internal standards.
@highlight The sensitivity of PGs were increased about 100 fold compared with underived ones.
@highlight Prostaglandins in uterus of AUB rat model were successfully quantified.
