 The preparation of a highly efficient chiral liquid chromatography column is explored by dynamically coating a reversed phase porous silicon pillar array column with hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin as the chiral selector . Analyte mixtures composed of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs were tested to reveal the enantioseparation potential of the column . The mechanism of chiral discrimination was investigated . The adsorbed Hp CDs on the column surface experience different interaction with enantiomers . The chiral stationary phase showed satisfying stability and could be easily restored by recovering the selector with sufficient flushing and repeating the loading procedure . The peak capacity of the column was evaluated and it was found high enough to separate three enantiomer couples using a one dimensional LC technique .
