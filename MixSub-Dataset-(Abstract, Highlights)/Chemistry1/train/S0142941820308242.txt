 Stress concentration and weak interfacial strength affect the mechanical properties of short carbon fibers reinforced polymer composites . In this work the cauliflower like short carbon fibers were prepared and the point was to illuminate the effects of fiber morphology on the mechanical properties of the CCFs rigid polyurethane composites . The results indicated that the surface structure of CCFs could increase the surface roughness of the fibers and the contact area between fibers and matrix thereby promoting the formation of irregular interface . Compared with pure RPU and initial CFs RPU composites the strength and toughness of CCFs RPU composites were simultaneously improved . The satisfactory performance was attributed to the special fibers structure which played an anchoring role and consumed more energy during crack propagation .

@highlight Cauliflower like carbon fibers CCFs were prepared by metal electrodeposition.
@highlight CCFs rigid polyurethane RPU composites were prepared with the special interface.
@highlight The less stress concentration and the better stress distribution were realized.
@highlight The special interface increased the crack propagation path and energy absorption.
@highlight The strength and toughness of CCFs RPU composites were improved simultaneously.
