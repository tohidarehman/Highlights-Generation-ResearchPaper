 The focus of this work is physico chemical study of model mixtures containing butanol a component of perspective biofuel . New detailed data on liquid liquid equilibria solubility and critical compositions were obtained at 293.15K and atmospheric pressure for quaternary propionic acid

@highlight LLE for the propionic acid
@highlight  butanol
@highlight  butyl propionate water have been determined at 293.15K.
@highlight LLE compositions were correlated by NRTL model.
@highlight Solubility and compositions of critical points have been obtained at 293.15K.
@highlight The critical surface in quaternary system was considered.
