 Quasi static tensile test of UHMWPE fiber reinforced composite laminate is challenging to perform due to low interlaminar shear strength and low coefficient of friction . Tensile tests proposed in the literature were conducted and limitations associated with each method led to the evolution of a new method . Tensile test of single ply was realized as the best representative of tensile strength of a composite than tensile test of UHMWPE laminate . A fixture was developed for single ply tests which increased friction and provided the mechanical constraint to slipping . The fixture is easy to fabricate and has provided repeatable results for eight grades of UHMWPE fiber based fabrics . Reported tensile strengths are in quite high range of 9001500MPa .

@highlight Ballistic composites are quite different from structural composites.
@highlight Tensile strength difficult to determine with standard methods.
@highlight All available methods tested for efficacy.
@highlight A new method is suggested for efficient testing.
@highlight Properties of wight commercial grades determined by suggested method.
