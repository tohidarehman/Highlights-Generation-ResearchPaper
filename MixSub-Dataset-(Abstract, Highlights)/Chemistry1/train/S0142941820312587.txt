 A novel green and effective approach to fabricate uniform functional spherical polymer particles remains a huge challenge . Herein we present a novel one pot approach superior to traditional precipitation polymerization called precipitated droplets

@highlight A novel one pot approach to fabricate uniform functional spherical polymer particles was presented.
@highlight Corn oil is firstly used as natural immiscible solvent for reaction system and almost ideal reaction system is insisted without any toxic organic solvent or stabilizer.
@highlight All functional particles mentioned in this work are prepared from monomer droplets in 60s.
@highlight The size and porosity of the particles can be adjusted freely with uniform particle size ensured.
@highlight It provides a wide platform for fabricating various functional spherical particles.
