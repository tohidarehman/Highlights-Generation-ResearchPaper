 The goal of the paper was to investigate the influence of graphene on properties and structure of suspensive poly . PVC GN nanocomposites were obtained by the solvent evaporation method and their structures were evaluated using optical microscopy SEM FT IR XRD and Raman spectroscopy methods . Thermal properties of the obtained materials were studied by TGA . Electrical properties and swelling behaviour were also determined .

@highlight Poly vinyl chloride nanocomposites with different contents of graphene GN were prepared by solution casting method.
@highlight Structure and graphene dispersion level in PVC matrix by optical SEM microscopy and XRD method were studied.
@highlight Thermal stability swelling degree and electrical resistivity of the PVC GN nanocomposites were studied.
@highlight The addition of graphene causes an increase in chemical resistance of poly vinyl chloride against acetone.
@highlight The obtained electrical properties of PVC 5 GN nanocomposite allow for including it into anti static materials group.
