 This article describes a new simultaneous method for the analysis of sulfur type poisons hydrocarbons and permanent gases affecting the productivity of the Ziegler Natta catalyst during the synthesis of polypropylene on an industrial scale in a fluidized bed reactor . The identification was achieved employing a configuration of the seven valve chromatographic system with events at different times allowing distribution of the sample through multiple columns and finally reaching the helium ionization detectors of pulsed discharge flame ionization and mass spectrometry . The results obtained show a good precision of the method used because the variability was less than 1.02 in area and 0.49 in retention time for short term precisin and longer term precision . The quantification of these species was successful after performing the calibration curve with the dynamic mixer showing an

@highlight New simultaneous method for the analysis of sulfur type poisons hydrocarbons and permanent gases.
@highlight The identification was achieved using a configuration of seven valves eight columns and three detectors.
@highlight the variability was less than 1.02 in area and 0.49 in retention time.
@highlight Productivity losses during polypropylene production were between 5 and 22 .
