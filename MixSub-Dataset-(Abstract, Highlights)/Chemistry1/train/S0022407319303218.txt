 In this study Hapke s radiative transfer model is used to verify the feasibility of retrieving the composition and grain size of the ground in an open pit mine seen as a regolith . Such a tool could be useful for dust surveys and thus preventing potential environmental risks such as acid mine drainage . As the true compositional endmembers of the medium are not retrieved but rather chosen from spectral libraries and the range of grain sizes and porosities vary greatly in an open pit mine we show that the mineralogical unmixing results are not reliable . Too many combinations of different relative abundances grain sizes and porosities lead to fits between modelled and measured spectra under 0.3 in reflectance . To tackle this issue we explore a lithological unmixing approach . Considering lithologies as endmembers as opposed to considering minerals reduces the variability in the solutions as fewer endmembers are used . The results show that the studied samples with multi component grains behave spectrally as expected for mono mineral grains . With no root mean square errors higher than 5 the relative abundances retrieved are sufficiently precise to consider mapping lithologies with this method .

@highlight An open pit mine can be seen as a regolith.
@highlight A mineralogical segregation occurs during the crushing sieving process.
@highlight RMSEs are not discriminant to retrieve minerals relative abundances.
@highlight Considering lithologies as pure endmembers is a valid assumption.
