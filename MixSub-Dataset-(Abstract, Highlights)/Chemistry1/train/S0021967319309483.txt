 Therapeutic antibodies can elicit an immune response through different mechanisms either cell independent via complement activation or through activation of immune effector cells . After target binding the Fc part of the antibody will interact with Fc receptors on the surface of effector cells leading to activation and lysis of the target cells by a mechanism called antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity . The ADCC of an antibody can be increased by modifying the carbohydrates on the Fc part . If the fucose on the first

@highlight Fully fucosylated mono fucosylated and a fucosylated IgGs were separated.
@highlight Mono and a fucosylated IgGs had equivalent biological activity.
@highlight Relative peak area of FcRIIIa chromatography correlated to fucose content.
@highlight High throughput label and modification free screening of IgG producing clones.
