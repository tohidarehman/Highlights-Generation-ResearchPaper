 We improved the recyclability of mixed poly and poly bottle waste . We made uncompatibilized and compatibilized PET PLA blends of different weight ratios with a twin screw extruder . Then we analysed the mechanical properties the miscibility and the thermal stability of the blends with and without compatibilizers . From the change in intrinsic viscosities we concluded that different reactions occur between the polymer chains due to the compatibilizers . We observed that when ethylene butyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate as compatibilizer was added the blends became tougher elongation at break and Charpy impact strength increased but Young s modulus of the blends decreased . In addition the compatibilizers improved the thermal stability of the blends and this may have been caused by a number of mechanisms .

@highlight Biodegradable polymers e.g. PLA PBAT may appear in the petrol based polymer waste stream.
@highlight The two components PLA and PET are incompatible and immiscible at least in the concentrations investigated.
@highlight Ethylene butyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate as compatibilizer was added to the blends.
@highlight The applied compatibilizers increased the thermal stability of the blends.
@highlight Elongation at break and Charpy impact strength increased when E BA GMA was added.
