 Nowadays green neteric solvents are replaced the conventional organic solvents . In this regard deep eutectic solvents have evolved as neoteric solvents similar to ionic liquids with various applications in different fields . This paper reports the density and speed of sound data of the ionic liquid 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate in the some DESs choline chloride urea choline chloride ethylene glycol choline chloride glycerol and choline chloride oxalic acid in dilute region concentration of the IL at temperature ranges

@highlight Volumetric properties of IL EMIM ES in four deep eutectic solvent were measured.
@highlight Redlich Mayer equation was used to correlate of
@highlight and
@highlight in infinite dilution.
@highlight The solute solvent interactions are in order ChCl U ChCl EG ChCl Gly ChCl OX.
