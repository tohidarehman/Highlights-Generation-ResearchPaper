 In the present study montmorillonite nanoclay and copper oxide nanoparticles reinforced polyvinylchloride based flexible nanocomposite films were prepared via solvent casting technique . Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy X ray diffraction Scanning electron microscopy and thermo gravimetric analysis the structural morphological and thermal properties of PVC MMT CuO nanocomposite films with various loadings of CuO NPs and MMT were investigated . These studies suggested that by the addition of dual nanofillers in the polymer matrix some structural modifications occurred owing to the homogenous dispersion of MMT and CuO NPs within the PVC matrix . The TGA results reveal that the addition of CuO NPs and MMT considerably improved the thermal stability of the nanocomposites . The EMI shielding effectiveness of nanocomposites was examined in the X band and Ku band frequency regions . The EMI SE values were found to be 30 dB and 35 dB for nanocomposites containing 0.3wt of CuO NPs and 4.7wt of MMT respectively while the shielding was found to be absorption dominant . These results emphasize that PVC MMT CuO nanocomposite films can be used as a potential EMI shielding material .
