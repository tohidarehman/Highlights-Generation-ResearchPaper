 In this work polypropylene ethylene propylene diene monomer butadiene acrylonitrile rubber TPVs with different EPDM NBR ratios were prepared by the core shell dynamic vulcanization . The relationship between the core shell structure and mechanical properties of the TPVs were thoroughly investigated . The formation of core shell structure by adding NBR is conducive to the mechanical properties of the TPVs . The ratio of EPDM to NBR has an important effect on the structure and performances of the final products and there is a critical ratio for this effect change . Transmission electron microscope tensile test reprocessing test ageing test rheological behavior test and stress relaxation were used to characterize the morphology and properties of the TPVs in detail . It was found that when the ratio of EPDM NBR was 2 4 the tensile strength increased by 14 compared with PP EPDM TPV without NBR . Meanwhile the reprocessing properties rheological characteristics and instantaneous tensile deformation

@highlight Core shell structure with EPDM as the shell and NBR as the core was formed in the PP EPDM NBR ternary TPV.
@highlight There is a critical rubber ratio to form perfect core shell structure.
@highlight The relationship between core shell structure and the mechanical properties were studied thoroughly.
@highlight The mechanical properties could be further regulated by changing the ratios of the rubber phases.
@highlight The core shell structure could also affect the aging performances of the TPVs.
