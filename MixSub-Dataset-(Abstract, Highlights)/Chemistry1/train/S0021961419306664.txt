 Cyclopentanol is an important intermediate in a production of many chemical specialties . This paper relates to a development of a new technology of indirect cyclopentene hydration in the presence of formic acid and presents the data of liquid liquid equilibrium for the ternary system of under atmospheric pressure and within a temperature range from 298.2K to 338.2K . The experiments were conducted in a temperature controlled glass cell and the received data were correlated with nonrandom two liquid and universal quasichemical equations in order to obtain binary coefficients describing LLE of the given system . A consistency of the experimental tie lines data was validated by the Bachman and Othmer Tobias equations and the data fitting accuracy was evaluated by the use of the calculated average absolute deviation and the root mean square error values . According to our best knowledge the LLE of this system have not yet been published elsewhere and the values of binary interaction parameters should be used for the design of the reactor and separation units in the process of indirect cyclopentene hydration .

@highlight Exp. data are coherent throught Bachman and Othmer Tobias equations.
@highlight Binary interaction parameters for NRTL and UNIQUAC models were calculated.
@highlight NRTL and UNIQUAC models fit data accurately based on AAD and RMSE values.
