 The separation of 14 chiral sulfoxides was systematically studied on 12 cellulose based chiral columns in acetonitrile and acetonitrile water mobile phases . Out of all monosubstituted methylphenylcarbamates of cellulose the one having a methyl moiety in position 3 showed more universal chiral resolving ability compared to 2 and 4 substituted derivatives . Out of disubstituted phenylcarbamates of cellulose the ones with methyl substituents showed higher enantiomer resolving ability compared to chloro substituted ones and substitution in positions 3 of the phenyl moiety was clearly advantageous . From disubstituted derivatives those possessing a combination of methyl and chloro substituents were advantageous compared to the ones having dimethyl or dichloro substituents . Chiral recognition ability of most chiral selectors towards studied sulfoxides was higher in pure acetonitrile compared to previously studied methanol . The effect of water addition to the mobile phase on analyte retention and enantioseparation was also quite different from that observed with methanol . In particular with aqueous methanol by increasing the water content in the mobile phase retention increased in most cases and the separation factor improved . In contrast with aqueous acetonitrile retention and separation factors decreased up to a certain water content in the mobile phase and then started to recover again for most of the studied analytes .
