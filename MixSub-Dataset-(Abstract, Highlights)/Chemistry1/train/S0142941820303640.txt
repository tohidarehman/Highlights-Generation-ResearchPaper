 A combination of knowledge on curing process of rubber mixes with novel methods of chemical analysis a new unconventional approach to analysis of rubber vulcanization is presented in this study . Six SBR samples containing various N tert butyl 2 benzothiazole sulfenamide accelerator sulfur ratios the range of conventional sulfur vulcanization system were studied using multi capillary column ion mobility spectrometry technique . For these analysis calibration dilution curves were established . Moreover data from MCC IMS were correlated with other parameters of the rubber vulcanizates their crosslink density and structure as well as their tensile strength and modulus at elongation . For such comparison one of the reaction products from thermal decomposition of TBBS benzothiazole was selected . Furthermore the concentration of benzothiazole released during the vulcanization process corresponded well with the crosslink density of the rubber vulcanizates studied . It was even possible to calculate the crosslink density from the concentration of benzothiazole determined by MCC IMS using Boltzmann fitting curve . The presented results could be an important contribution in understanding the mechanisms occurring during rubber vulcanization demonstrating a new approach to testing and evaluation of the process .
