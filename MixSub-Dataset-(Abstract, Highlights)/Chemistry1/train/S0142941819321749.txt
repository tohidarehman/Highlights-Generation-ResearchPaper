 An adaptable flexural test fixture is proposed to characterise the mechanical properties of miniature beam specimens at ambient conditions or in the presence of fluids at elevated temperatures . The fixture is validated using representative amorphous and semi crystalline polymers . The response of miniature specimens is compared against that of medium sized specimens on the same fixture and on conventional test equipment . Good agreement is found between the specimen sizes for all materials but the comparisons highlight small differences attributed to factors such as specimen dimensional accuracy crystallinity and span to thickness ratios . Flexural tests in water at 37C using both specimen sizes were performed to investigate the evolution of mechanical behaviour of hydrolytically degraded polylactides . Here specimen size influences the diffusion timescale of acidic by products which can reduce or enhance autocatalysis .

@highlight Designed and built a 3 point bending test fixture for miniature 10mg through to small 1g polymer specimens.
@highlight Fixture can be immersed in a heated water bath for measurements.
@highlight Dry and wet amorphous and semi crystalline polymers were used for validation against conventional test equipment.
@highlight Good agreement was found in the flexural properties measured with the fixture compared to conventional equipment.
