 In this study we investigated the differences in the crystallinity of starch films with different moisture contents stored in different humidity conditions and evaluated their thermal adhesion and sealing properties . X ray diffraction analysis revealed an association between the degree of crystallinity and the moisture content in starch films crystallinity decreased with an increase in the moisture content . Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis showed that films with low moisture content failed to completely adhere but films with a high moisture content and lower crystallinity showed good adherence with two films perfectly adhered at the same temperature because water molecules acted as a mobility enhancer . The peeling test demonstrated the failure modes of the heat bound films . The cassava starch film which had a low amylose content and crystallinity showed better adhesion compared to other starch films .

@highlight Crystallinity of starch film was affected by amylose amylopectin ratio.
@highlight Starch film with low amylose and crystallinity showed better adhesion property.
@highlight Water molecules in starch film facilitated sealing due to its plasticization effect.
@highlight Starch film at high RH showed higher moisture content and better sealing quality.
