 We discuss several possible phenomena in electrophoretic systems with complexing agents present in the background electrolyte . In our previous work we extended the linear theory of electromigration with the first order nonlinear term which originally applied to acid base equilibria only by generalizing it to any fast chemical equilibria . This extension provides us with a fresh insight into the well established technique of elecktrokinetic chromatography . We combine mathematical analysis of the generalized model with its solution by means of the new version of our software PeakMaster 6 and experimental data . We re examine the fundamental equations by Wren and Rowe and Tiselius in the frame of the generalized linear theory of electromigration . Besides we show that selector concentration can increase inside the interacting analyte zone due to its complexation with the analyte which contradicts the generally accepted idea of a consumption of a portion of the selector inside the zone . Next we focus our discussion on interacting buffers . We demonstrate how such side interaction of the selector with another buffer constituent can influence measuring analyte selector interactions . Finally we describe occurrence and mobilities of system peaks in these EKC systems .
