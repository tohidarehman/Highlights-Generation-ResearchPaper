 GCGC is an advanced separation technique allowing to achieve quantitative and qualitative characterization of complex samples . In order to perform two dimensional separation the system must provide suitable peak modulation which will direct short impulses of first column flow towards the second column . Forward fill flush differential flow modulation is a cost effective and no cryogen requiring approach which allows modulation over a wide range of analytes with very different boiling points . However optimization of the flow modulation process can be difficult to understand and quantification performance might be compromised if the parameters of the modulation process are not properly set . Modulated peak shape can be a good indication of the efficiency of the modulation process however it is not sufficient to guarantee good quantification . Different average velocities in the beginning and the end of the thermally programmed GC run may cause different efficiency of the modulation process in various parts of the chromatogram . The purpose of this work is to investigate quantitative performance of the forward fill flush modulation and delineate parameters that determine the effectiveness of the modulation process and its ability to properly reflect the quantitative composition of the investigated sample .

@highlight Quantitative performance of forward fill flush modulation is investigated in detail.
@highlight Parameters influencing efficiency of the modulation are delineated.
@highlight Relation between modulated peak shape and analyte quantitation is explored.
@highlight Role of the modulation fill and flush distances is explored through appropriate calculations.
