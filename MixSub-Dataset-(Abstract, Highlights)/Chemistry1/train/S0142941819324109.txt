 Unfilled natural rubber compounds composed of conventional semi efficient efficient and sulfur donor vulcanization systems were heat aged to promote sulfur reversion . Rheometry hardness strain strain characteristics including Mooney Rivlin analysis equilibrium solvent swell and Double Quantum Nuclear Magnetic Resonance were used to monitor crosslink density changes . A loss of crosslink density was observed by rheometry C

@highlight Crosslink density loss observed by rheometry Mooney Rivlin C
@highlight  equilibrium swelling and DQ NMR.
@highlight Crosslink density loss followed CV SEV EVSD.
@highlight Chain scission reactions not observed during reversion.
@highlight Crosslink distributions were mono distributed and narrowed during curing.
@highlight Network homogeneity followed EV SD SEV CV.
