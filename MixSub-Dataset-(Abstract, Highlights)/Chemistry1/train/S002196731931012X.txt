 From the analytical chemistry point of view an ideal sample preparation method should be simple rapid automatic selective precise exhaustive reproducible and protect the analyte of interest from degradation . In this study a novel sample preparation method named pressurized matrix solid phase dispersion

@highlight A novel and advanced sample preparation methodology 
@highlight  MSPD was proposed.
@highlight The
@highlight  MSPD was performed with LC MS instrument.
@highlight The
@highlight  MSPD can simultaneously extract separate purify isolate and analyze endogenous components.
@highlight The
@highlight  MSPD allowed for isolation of some pure compounds with MS guided fractionation.
@highlight Subsequent NMR analysis permitted further structural elucidation of compounds.
