 The development of high performance biomass derived epoxy thermosets with excellent flame resistance is vital to various applications . Herein a difunctional epoxy monomer bisphenyl phenyl phosphate was synthesized from abundant and biobased eugenol . In addition BEU EP was cured by 4 4 diaminodiphenyl methane and the cured resin diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A DDM was used as a reference . Results indicated that BEU EP DDM not only showed a 58.1 28.8 and 35.1 increase in residual char flexural and storage modulus compared with DGEBA DDM but also exhibited excellent flame resistance and smoke suppression . BEU EP DDM passed V 0 rating with limiting oxygen index of 38.4 and greatly decreased the peak heat release rate and total smoke production by 84.9 and 80.5 respectively . The mechanism analysis confirmed that the phosphorus containing group and aromatic structure from BEU EP contributed both the gas and condensed phase flame retardation of BEU EP DDM network . This work provides an efficient and scalable route for synthesizing biobased epoxy thermosets with high integrated performance and superior flame resistance .

@highlight A biomass derived epoxy thermoset was synthesized from phosphorus containing compound.
@highlight Phosphorus containing structure promotes char formation and reduces the fire hazards of epoxy thermoset.
@highlight The new epoxy thermoset exhibits superior mechanical properties and high smoke suppression.
@highlight This paper provides a new strategy for enhancing the fire resistance of bio based epoxy thermoset.
