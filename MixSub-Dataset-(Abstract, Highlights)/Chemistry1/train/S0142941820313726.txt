 In this paper a polyether ether ketone epoxy composite was prepared by using PEEK microparticles as the reinforcement . The nonisothermal differential scanning calorimetry test was used to evaluate the curing reaction of PEEK epoxy resin system . The curing kinetics of this system were examined utilizing nonisothermal kinetic analyses isoconversional methods and an autocatalytic reaction model . During these analyses the kinetic parameters and models were obtained the curing behavior of PEEK epoxy resin system under dynamic conditions was predicted . The results show that isoconversional methods can adequately interpret the curing behavior of PEEK epoxy resin system and that the theoretical DSC curves calculated by the autocatalytic reaction model are in good agreement with experimental data . Furthermore the tensile elongation at break tensile strength flexural strength compression strength and compression modulus increased by 81.6 33.66 36.53 10.98 and 15.14 respectively when PEEK microparticles were added in epoxy resin composites .
