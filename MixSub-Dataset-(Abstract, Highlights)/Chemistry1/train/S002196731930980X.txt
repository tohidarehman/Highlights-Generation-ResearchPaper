 It has been known that anion exchangers prepared by grafting poly onto Sepharose FF at ionic capacities over 600mmol L show both high protein adsorption capacity and uptake kinetics and charge reversal of PEI Sepharose by modification with succinic anhydride can produce protein cation exchangers of high capacity and uptake rate . Previously a

@highlight PEI Sepharose was modified via two different routes to derive cation exchangers.
@highlight They are
@highlight and
@highlight routes.
@highlight The
@highlight route showed a complex reaction mechanism.
@highlight resins showed superior properties over the others.
