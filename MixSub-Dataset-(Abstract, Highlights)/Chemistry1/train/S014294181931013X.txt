 Flame retardants are applied to select consumer products such as baby clothing construction materials electronics and furniture upholstery to slow or prevent fire ignition or growth by physical chemical mechanisms . The most commonly used FRs have historically been halogenated molecules . However their bioaccumulation in mammals has been investigated leading to some of them to be banned . As an alternative FR this study investigated the potential of carbonaceous nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide coating material on polyester fabric . CNMs mass loadings on fabrics were verified by programmed thermal analysis and tested for flame retardancy using a new assessment approach based on National Fire Protection Association method 705 . Compared with traditional FRs select CNMs showed similar flame retardancy at lower mass loadings . The oxygen content of CNMs as measured by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy emerged as a critical parameter with higher oxygen content resulting in reduced flame retardancy of the coating . Non nano sized carbonaceous materials such a carbon black did not exhibit the same flame retardant properties as CNMs . Multi walled carbon nanotubes and amine functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes e.g . NH
