 Here we synthesized two kinds of novel conjugated block copolymers P1 and P2 by reacting squaric acid and three kinds of homemade diamine monomers . The polymers P1 and P2 can be dissolved in many normal organic solvents and form films by solution cast method with high mechanical properties . In addition when the 10 weight loss is selected as a reference point the polymers P1 and P2 showed the thermal decomposition temperatures at around 309 and 312C respectively . The polymer films exhibit high coloration efficiencies 262282cm

@highlight Two kinds soluble high coloration efficiency electrochromic polymers based squaric acid and three kinds diamines were synthetised.
