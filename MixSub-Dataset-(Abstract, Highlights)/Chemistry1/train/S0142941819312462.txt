 In this study thermal and mechanical properties of novel nanocomposite epoxy resin reinforced with octadecylamine functionalized graphene oxide and Sasobit prepared via creative vacuum shock technique were investigated . By introducing 1 3 and 5wt Sasobit to the neat epoxy resin the tensile strength increased remarkably by 104 315 and 266 respectively due to the unique stiff and crystalline structure of Sasobit . In addition considerable enhancement of 125 in Young s modulus 351 in toughness 562 in impact resistance 19C in thermal stability and 7C in glass transition temperature of epoxy resin with 3wt Sasobit loading was demonstrated . The composite containing 3wt Sasobit alone were found to have even superior properties than GO ODA epoxy nanocomposite as surprisingly 3 2.9 2.2 and 2 times more improvement respectively in tensile strength toughness impact strength and thermal stability of epoxy resin compared to reinforcement with GO ODA were obtained .
