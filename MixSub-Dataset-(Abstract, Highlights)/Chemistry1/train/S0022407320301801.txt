 A computational experimental method for the investigation of photochemical and thermal effect on a methane ethylene flow was developed to determine the saturation intensity of ethylene in the high temperature region up to 1000 1200 K at a pressure near 1 atm . This method included experiments on radiation absorption and a developed numerical model of the cell . Saturation intensity

@highlight A method for investigation of radiation action on a absorbent flow was developed.
@highlight Temperature field was calculated within the numerical mathematical model.
@highlight The saturation intensity was found for three powers 60 35 and 12 W.
@highlight The relaxation time of the excited state of ethylene was estimated.
