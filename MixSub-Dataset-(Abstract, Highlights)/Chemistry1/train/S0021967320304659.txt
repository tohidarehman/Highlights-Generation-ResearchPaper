 Nowadays sensitive chiral methods are required for the determination of chiral impurities and for assays in biological samples . Supercritical fluid chromatography one of the main techniques to separate chiral molecules can be coupled to MS to provide such sensitive methods . Moreover chiral separation strategies are very useful to reduce the development time and cost of such methods . This study investigates the transfer of an existing non MS compatible screening step into an MS compatible one . The initial step had a cumulative success rate of 100 for 57 tested compounds using methanol or 2 propanol as mobile phase modifier on one of four chiral stationary phases . The additives applied in the original mobile phases i.e . isopropylamine and trifluoroacetic acid negatively affect the ionization in SFC MS and thus need to be replaced . Formic acid acetic acid water ammonia ammonium acetate and ammonium formate were investigated as MS compatible additives in different combinations and concentrations . Only methanol based mobile phases were considered in this study because high system pressures were obtained with isopropanol . The other experimental parameters remained the same as in the initial screening step . The effects of the alternative additives on the obtained resolutions as well as on the global success rate were investigated . The best alternative MS compatible mobile phase contained 0.5 CH
