 The present study reports the results of structural and mechanical analysis as well as proteins release kinetics and osteointegration in mice craniotomy model of highly porous PEEK and PEEK HA biomimetic scaffolds loaded with

@highlight Novel biomimetic PEEK HA scaffold for reconstructive surgery was developed.
@highlight PEEK HA scaffold with 80 porosity and special microrelief mimics trabecular bone.
@highlight Scaffold provides tissue ingrowth on model of critical sized cranial bone defects in mice.
@highlight BMP 2 and EPO enhance neoosteogenesis and angiogenesis.
@highlight Non activated PEEK is able to spontaneously bind both BMP 2 and EPO.
