 This study reports the use ofa natural deep eutectic solvent with hollow fiber microporous membrane liquid liquid microextraction for the multiclass determination of 11 compounds classified as emerging contaminantsin water . Different deep eutectic solvents were synthetized and Thymol Camphor wasused as extraction solvent . The Thymol Camphor was impregnated into the polypropylene membrane porous for 10min replacing commonly used solvents . The optimized parameters were obtained by multi and univariate models . Extractions were carried out for 50min using 1.5mL of water sample at pH 6 and without addition of salt while desorption was made in a mixture of acetone methanol for 15min . Separation quantification was conducted by HPLC with a diode array detection and calibration curves were obtained for each analyte . Determination coefficients higher than 0.9906 and limits of detection ranged from 0.3 to 6.1g L

@highlight A simple easy and fast multiclass method for emerging contaminants determination is proposed.
@highlight A natural deep eutectic solvent was successfully applied as extraction phase.
@highlight Less than 1mL of organic solvent was used in the entire sample preparation process.
@highlight Possibility of automation of the technique with 96 simultaneous extractions.
