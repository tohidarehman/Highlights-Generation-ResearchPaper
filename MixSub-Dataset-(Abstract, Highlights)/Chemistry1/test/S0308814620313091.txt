 Quantification of the specific folate vitamers to estimate total folate in foods is not standardized . A collaborative study including eight European laboratories was conducted in order to determine the repeatability and reproducibility of the method for folate quantification in foods using the plant origin glutamyl hydrolase as part of the extraction procedure . The seven food samples analyzed represent the food groups fruits vegetables dairy products legumes offal fish and fortified infant formula . The homogenization step was included and six folate vitamers were analyzed using LC MS MS. Total folate content expressed as folic acid equivalent was 17490g 100g in all samples . Horwitz ratio values were within the acceptable range except for fish . The results for fortified infant formula a certified reference material confirmed the trueness of the method . The collaborative study is part of a standardization project within the Nordic Committee on Food Analysis .

@highlight Specific LC MS MS method for folate analysis in food is inter laboratory validated.
@highlight Total folate results acceptable in six tested food samples for salmon unacceptable.
@highlight HorRat values for total folate and 5 CH
@highlight  H
@highlight folate were within the acceptable range.
@highlight Acceptability of HorRat values for other studied vitamers depends on food matrix.
@highlight For total folate repeatability at 2.3 15 and reproducibility at 8.7 58
