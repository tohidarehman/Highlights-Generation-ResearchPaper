 Phytosterols are a group of sterols distributed in foods and plants where it is prone to oxidation . In this work we studied the reaction mechanism of phytosterols using density functional theory calculation and experimental methods to study the photooxidation of phytosterols . Under LED light illumination experimental photooxidation of these phytosterols gives rise to the prior three kind oxides of phytosterol 6 OH 7 OH and 7 OH . The mechanistic investigations by DFT suggest that singlet oxygen

@highlight The photooxidation of sterol led to the same kind of products and oxidation pattern.
@highlight 7 OOH derivative was the most abundant followed by 7 OOH and 6 OOH derivative.
@highlight Oxidation starts with free radical coupling in C5 and a diradical reaction in C6.
@highlight The C5 products generate 7 OOH sterols via the R3 rearrangement pathway.
