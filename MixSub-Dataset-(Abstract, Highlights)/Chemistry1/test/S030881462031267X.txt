 The two phase technology for olive oil extraction generates large amounts of pat olive cake a by product that is rich in bioactive health promoting compounds . Here response surface methodology was used to maximize supercritical CO

@highlight RSM was effective to optimize SC CO
@highlight oil extraction from pat olive cake POC .
@highlight Under the optimized operative conditions 65 of the total POC oil was extracted.
@highlight SC CO
@highlight extracted POC oil had higher concentrations of lipophilic bioactives than EVOO.
@highlight POC oil oral administration 040Ldie
@highlight  had no effects on mice liver redox status.
@highlight POC oil molecules may be useful to improve restore mitochondrial defective functions.
