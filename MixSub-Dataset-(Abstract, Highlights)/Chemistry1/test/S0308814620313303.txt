 In this study a new method for simultaneous determination of cyantraniliprole chlorantraniliprole tetrachlorantraniliprole cyclaniliprole and flubendiamide in edible mushrooms by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry combined with a modified QuEChERS procedure . The samples were extracted using acetonitrile and then cleaned up by primary secondary amine and octadecylsilane . The determination of these insecticides was achieved in less than 5min using an electrospray ionization source in positive mode for cyantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole while negative mode for tetrachlorantraniliprole cyclaniliprole and flubendiamide . The linearities of the calibrations for all target compounds were acceptable R

@highlight This is the first study to determine five diamide insecticides in mushrooms.
@highlight QuEChERS method was firstly used to extract diamide insecticides in mushrooms.
@highlight The method showed satisfactory recovery and high sensitivity.
@highlight Application of the method validation exhibited excellent results.
