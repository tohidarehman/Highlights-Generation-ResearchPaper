 In Crimson Seedless grapes the appearance of senescence caused by abnormal dark red color the loss of crisp taste caused by the decrease in firmness and the fading of sweetness caused by the decrease in total soluble sugar are the main problems affecting its edible qualities after storage . In the mesocarp burdock fructooligosaccharide restricted sucrose export therefore more carbohydrates were retained directly leading to higher TSS and sweetness and cell osmotic pressure and firmness were retained indirectly . In the exocarp BFO restricted sucrose import therefore the signal molecule sucrose was reduced and the senescence related processes were inhibited . The downregulation of

@highlight BFO limit the flesh sugar export to improve the sweetness TSS and crispness firmness.
