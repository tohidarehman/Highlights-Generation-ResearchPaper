 Ultrasound has been recognized as a non thermal technology for accelerating blueberry wine aging for flavor development . However influence of US on anthocyanin and color characteristics is uncertain . In this study US was applied to new blueberry wine and changes in color characteristics anthocyanin content and anti oxidant capacity were evaluated at early stage of aging period . Low frequency power US resulted in an improvement in color characteristics and lower chromatic aberration as compared to untreated samples specially at condition of 180W 20min and 2 cycles . Furthermore this contribution was attributed to unattenuated anthocyanins protected from US stress . Importantly the structural polarity dependence was mediated by the impact of US on anthocyanins . Additionally anti oxidant activity of blueberry wine was not adversely affected under a moderate US condition . US treatment of blueberry wine was therefore considered to significantly enhance the color presentation hinting at the possibility of promoting blueberry wine aging .

@highlight Proper ultrasonic treatment improves color presentation of blueberry wine.
@highlight Color change after ultrasonic treatment might be due to the anthocyanins alteration.
@highlight The impact of ultrasound on anthocyanins is structural polarity dependent.
@highlight Proper ultrasonic treatment ameliorates anti oxidative capacity of blueberry wine.
