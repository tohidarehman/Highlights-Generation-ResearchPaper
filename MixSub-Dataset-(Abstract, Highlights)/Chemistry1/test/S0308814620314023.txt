 A novel of magnetic dummy template molecularly imprinted polymers were prepared by surface molecular imprinting technique . The structure of polymers were characterized and the binding properties were assessed by adsorption experiments . The synthetic mag MWCNTs DMIPs exhibit satisfying adsorption capacity excellent selectivity and fast adsorption rate toward phenoxy carboxylic acid herbicides . Afterwards a reliable analytical method for selective separation and determination of trace PCA herbicides in cereals was established by using magnetic solid phase extraction and UPLC MS MS detection . A series of requisite factors were optimized in detail to achieve expected extraction performance . Under the optimum MSPE parameters the mean spiked recoveries for analytes in different cereals ranged from 86.7 to 95.2 with intra and inter day precision not greater than 8.5 and 10.6 respectively . At last the developed method was successfully utilized for determination the four PCA herbicides in actual cereals .
