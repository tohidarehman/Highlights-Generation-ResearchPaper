 The nutritional and commercial value of the sweet cherry provides it a great economic importance in Italy . The aim of this study was to characterize 35 sweet cherry cultivars and one of sour cherry by analyzing values of different pomological and nutraceutical traits identifying cultivars with antioxidant activity and total anthocyanins content closest to those present in literature for Ferrovia . To this goal a multivariate metric index through the Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy analyzing an artificial dataset and testing a real one two hierarchical clustering and a principal component analysis were performed . The multivariate analyses result simultaneously investigated all the variables highlighting cvs . Sylvia Graffione nero Col di Mosso Ferrovia Mora della Punta Bianchetta Nuchis and Sandra to be more similar to literature data of Ferrovia . This matrix index was a useful tool to select the most commercial promising varieties .
