 Coumarins derivatives of cinnamic acid are found in wines aged in wooden barrels . The lab made molecularly imprinted polymers selective for simple coumarins were used in three forms as sorbents in solid phase extraction cartridge or pipette tip and coated on to the surface of magnetite for magnetic extraction . MIP 7 hydroxycoumarin had greater selectivity and extraction efficiency compared with conventional SPE sorbents . Batch extraction with MIP coated on to magnetic particles was relatively time consuming compared with conventional and pipette tip SPE . The advantage of pipette tip SPE was reduced solvent volumes . LOQs for MISPE offline coupled with HPLC were less than 1.5gmL

@highlight Lab made MIP showed higher recovery in comparison to conventional SPE sorbents.
@highlight MISPEHPLC DAD FLD method for determination of coumarins in wines was developed.
@highlight Scopoletin and 4 methylumbelliferone were detected in Slovak Tokaj wines.
