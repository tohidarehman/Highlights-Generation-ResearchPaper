 Folates are essential micronutrients for human health . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of storage processing and cooking methods on folate content and identify factors with great influence on folate retention in wheat grains and wheat based foods . For this the folate levels of wheat grains after 28months of storage wheat flours noodles fermented dough steamed bun and bread were sequentially analyzed . An average of 26 folate loss was observed after eight month storage in wheat grains . The milling process with an extraction rate of 70 led to a severe folate loss . The folate retention rate in noodles was 78 . Fermentation by yeast production enabled a 1.54 fold enhancement of folate levels in steamed bun and bread . Boiling steaming and baking led to a folate loss of 13 16 and 11 respectively . These results help to guide industrial household preparation of wheat based foods for folate nutrition .

@highlight Factors with significant influence on folates in wheat based foods were analysed.
@highlight Folates were more stable in wheat grains than in wheat powder.
@highlight Fermentation enabled a 1.54 fold increase of folate level in steamed bun and bread.
@highlight Boiling baking or steaming led to a folate loss of 1116 .
