 This study was to examine the formation of advanced glycation end products in black tea during drying process at 90 120 and 150C for 1h . Nine AGEs including N

@highlight Arginine derived advanced glycation end products were first detected in black tea.
@highlight Arginine derived advanced glycation end products were higher than lysine derived.
@highlight Argpyrimidine could be formed in black tea drying at 150C.
@highlight Glyoxal lysine dimer and methylglyoxal lysine dimer were not detected in black tea.
