 The conjugate prepared from epigallocatechin gallate and soy protein isolate under alkaline and aerobic conditions was analyzed using a Nano LC Q Orbitrap MS MS technique . The sulfhydryl and free amino groups of SPI were involved in covalent binding . Fifty one peptides were conjugated with EGCG . Fifty nine modified sites were identified located on Cys His Arg and Lys respectively . It is the first time to confirm that each of the two phenolic rings of EGCG contained a reactive site that bound to an amino acid residue . The amino acid residue reactivity amino acid sequence and composition affected the EGCG binding site in SPI . Lys and Arg residues are the most likely sites for modification and modification appears to reduce IgE binding . This study is helpful to elucidate the pattern of covalent binding of polyphenols to proteins in food systems and provides a theoretical basis for the directional modification of soy proteins with polyphenols .

@highlight The SPI EGCG conjugate was prepared under alkaline conditions.
