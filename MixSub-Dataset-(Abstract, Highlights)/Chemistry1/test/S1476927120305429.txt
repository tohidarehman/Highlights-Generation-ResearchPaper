 It has become obvious that fluorinated drugs have a significant role in medicinal applications . In this study the fluorination of 3 nitrotyrosine as an anti Parkinson and anti Alzheimer drug was explored using density functional theory calculations . We have investigated the most important chemical properties of 3 nitrotyrosine that affect the pharmacological activity of the drug . We found that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding and intramolecular charge of the drug were influenced by fluorine substitution . Our results also reveal that the fluorination altered the stability solubility and molecular polarity of the 3 nitrotyrosine drug . The density of state analysis also determines sharp resonance states of fluorine atoms with the 3 nitrotyrosine drug states particularly in the highest molecular orbital reigns suggesting hybridization of the fluorine states with the state of the drug . Moreover our results show that the electronic spectra of fluorinated derivatives of 3 nitrotyrosine drug exhibit a red shift toward higher wavelengths . Our calculations show that the free energy transfers of fluorinated derivatives of the 3 nitrotyrosine drug in water were negative that it meant that the designed molecules dissolving in aqueous phase occurred simultaneously . Consequently the results of the present study show that the fluorination of 3 nitrotyrosine drug could be considered as a promising strategy to design useful drugs with better pharmacological properties .
