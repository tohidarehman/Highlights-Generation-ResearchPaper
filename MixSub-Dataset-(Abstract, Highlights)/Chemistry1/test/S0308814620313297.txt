 The mood pyramid of cocoa which was previously proposed as a new concept consists of four levels . Roasting is a crucial process for flavor development in cocoa but is likely to have a negative impact on the phytochemicals . We investigated the effect of roasting time and temperature on the potential mood enhancing compounds corresponding to the distinct mood pyramid levels . Phytochemicals were analyzed using UPLC HRMS while the flavor was mapped via aroma and generic descriptive analysis . Results revealed that roasting at 130C for 30min did not significantly affect the levels of epicatechin procyanidin B2 and theobromine while salsolinol significantly increased . Moreover bitterness and astringency were reduced and the desired cocoa flavor was developed . Thus through selection of appropriate roasting time and temperature conditions phytochemicals of interest could be retained without comprising the flavor .

@highlight Cocoa beans were convectively roasted varying time and temperature.
@highlight Potential mood enhancing compounds and flavor of cocoa liquors were evaluated.
@highlight Roasting at 130 C 30 min did not affect epicatechin and procyanidin B2 levels.
@highlight Roasting at 130 C 30 min increased tryptamine serotonin and salsolinol levels.
@highlight Appropriate roasting could positively influence mood without compromising flavor.
