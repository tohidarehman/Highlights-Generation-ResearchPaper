 Polyphosphates are permitted as food additives but their undeclared utilisation is considered fraudulent . They improve water holding capacity of the seafood preventing biochemical physical changes during commercialization . The key objective of this study was the detection of polyphosphate in various seafood categories by means of high performance ion exchange chromatography with suppressed conductometry coupled to Q Exactive Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry . Ten frozen cuttlefish samples did not reveal any treatment while in ten frigate tunas high concentration of orthophospate was found . Unambiguous hexametaphosphate presence was demonstrated in four prawn samples while triphosphate was quantified in another four prawn samples that contained orthophosphate as well . Other samples sporadically encompassed polyphosphates profiles that varied according species and processing type . This analytical approach provided sustenance in better understanding regarding utilization of polyphosphates through HRMS fingerprinting of anionic species that would be specific in food safety control .
