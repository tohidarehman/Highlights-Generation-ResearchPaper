 Rehydration in an alkaline solution has been shown to improve the rehydration behaviour of milk protein isolate . In this study the focus is on citric acid neutralization of MPI powder dissolved in alkaline solution . The results showed that alkalization induced more negative zeta potential compared to MPI control reducing it from 22.4mV to 32.6mV . Neutralization had a relatively similar zeta potential value as alkalized sample . Sodium carbonate addition increased pH and caused a consequential reduction of ionic calcium in aqueous phase and neutralization caused a small increase in ionic calcium . Soluble aggregate of casein protein and whey protein was suggested in alkalization and neutralization process by non reducing SDS PAGE . In addition neutralization kept a stable colloidal particle size for pHs decreased to pH 9 8 and 7 however alkalization and neutralization created casein aggregates of larger colloidal particle size than primary casein micelle in control MPI .

@highlight Using citric acid for neutralization produced chelating agent citrate.
@highlight Calcium was mostly chelated during neutralization.
@highlight Neutralized milk protein solutions suggested a casein equilibration at around pH 8.
@highlight Neutralized MPI obtained slight increase particle size compared with alkalized MPI.
