 As a veterinary antibiotic lincomycin residues in milk are raising concerns of public on account of potential harm to human health . Efficient strategy is eagerly desired for detection of LIN from milk samples . Hence lincomycin molecularly imprinted membranes were developed for selective separation of LIN as an efficient pretreatment of milk samples . The synergistic effect of polyethylenimine and dopamine provided effective antifouling performance by improving the hydrophilicity . Based on click chemistry specific recognition sites were facilely formed on membranes using 4 vinylpyridine as functional monomers . The satisfactory rebinding capacity 151.62mgg

@highlight The synergistic effect of PEI and DA improves the antifouling of the membrane.
@highlight Click chemistry polymerization provides a mild and fast imprinting environment.
@highlight Stable selectivity 4.43 towards lincomycin was achieved by molecular imprinting.
@highlight An accurate method for the determination of lincomycin in milk was proposed.
