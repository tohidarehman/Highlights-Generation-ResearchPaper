 Perchlorate a persistent pollutant interferes with iodine uptake by the thyroid . Perchlorate exposure mainly occurs through ingested food understanding the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of perchlorate in foods facilitate more accurate human health risk assessments . An in vitro digestion Caco 2 cell model was used for this research . The bioaccessibility of perchlorate in the control group lettuce rice and formula was 93.45 70.14 70.25 and 63.68 respectively . The bioavailability of perchlorate was as follows control group 43.45 rice 37.17 lettuce 35.13 and formula 30.72 . The absorptive apparent permeability coefficient of the control lettuce rice and formula was 30101nm s 3265nm s 54161nm s and 4188nm s respectively . The results suggested that the risk from perchlorate was overestimated only when considering the content of perchlorate in foods and that the presence of food matrices reduced perchlorate bioavailability by differing degrees .

@highlight Bioaccessibility and bioavailability of perchlorate were evaluated by in vitro model.
@highlight Bioaccessibility and bioavailability of perchlorate were affected by food matrices.
@highlight The bioavailability of perchlorate provided the basis for assessment of internal exposure.
