 A series of alkylated benzimidazole derivatives was synthesized and screened for their anti HIV anti YFV and broad spectrum antiviral properties . The physicochemical parameters and drug like properties of the compounds were assessed first and then docking studies and MD simulations on HIV RT allosteric sites were conducted to find the possible mode of their action . DFT analysis was also performed to confirm the nature of the hydrogen bonding interaction of active compounds . The
