 The self microemulsifying delivery system was fabricated by whey protein isolate daidzein and surfactants the interaction of WPI Dai and D Tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate was hereby studied in the absence or presence of Tween 20 . The increase of surfactant concentration led to the decrease of the modulus and changes of protein interfacial conformation which allowed the formation of a strong intermolecular network . The environment and structure of WPI and daidzein could be changed by TPGS and the addition of Tween 20 could further enhance the interaction between the components by changing TPGS structure . With the increase of surfactants and oil phase

@highlight Interaction among WPI daidzein and surfactants in SMEDDS was firstly investigated.
@highlight WPI and daidzein occurred conformational changes with addition of surfactants.
@highlight The rotational motion of daidzein was restricted by WPI and surfactants.
@highlight WPI mixed with TPGS Tween 20 produced microemulsions with high stability.
