 The aim of this study is to extract zinc and manganese from foods and vegetables using an amphiphilic copolymer adsorbent poly co 2 vinylpyridine which was synthesized via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization from styrene and 2 vinyl pyridine in the presence of a trithiocarbonate and 2 2 azo bis isobutyro nitrile in toluene solution under argon at 80C . Fourier Transform Infrared and proton nuclear magnetic resonance

@highlight A new poly styrene co 2 vinyl pyridine copolymer was synthesized.
@highlight The copolymer adsorbent was characterized using FTIR and NMR.
@highlight The adsorbent showed high adsorption capacity for the manganese and zinc.
@highlight The recommended SPME was simple fast green and accurate.
@highlight Validation of the method was confirmed by analyzing of certified reference materials.
