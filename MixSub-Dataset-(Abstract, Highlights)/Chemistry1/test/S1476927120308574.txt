 RUNX family transcription factor 2 overexpression has been found in various human malignancies . However the expression levels of RUNX2 mRNA and protein in lung adenocarcinoma were not investigated . This study aims to thoroughly analysis the expression level and potential mechanisms of RUNX2 mRNA in LUAD . We applied in house immunohistochemistry high throughput RNA sequencing and gene microarrays to comprehensively investigate the expression level of RUNX2 in LUAD . A pool standard mean difference and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to assess the integrated expression value of RUNX2 in LUAD . The hazard ratios were integrated to evaluate the overall prognostic effect of RUNX2 on the LUAD patients . The differentially expressed genes of LUAD the potential target genes of RUNX2 and its co expressed genes were overlapped to obtain a set of specific genes for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses . RUNX2 overexpression in LUAD was validated using a large number of cases . The pooled SMD was 0.85 and the area under the curve of the SROC was 0.86 . The integrated HR was 1.20 indicating that increased expression of RUNX2 was an independent risk factor for the poor survival of the LUAD patients . RUNX2 and its transcriptionally regulates potential target genes may promote cell proliferation and drug resistance of LUAD by modulating the cell cycle and MAPK signaling pathways . RUNX2 can provide new research directions for targeted drug therapy and drug resistance for LUAD treatment .

@highlight RUNX2 overexpression in LUAD.
@highlight LUAD patients with upregulated RUNX2 expression have poor prognoses.
@highlight RUNX2 could regulate the cell cycle and MAPK signaling pathways in LUAD.
