 The dominant volatile off flavor compounds of pea and soy milk were investigated by gas chromatography olfactometry mass spectrometry sensory evaluation and odor activity values which led to the identification of their differences . We identified 11 aroma compounds as important odorants with OAVs greater than 1 in pea and soy milk . OAVs contribution rate demonstrated that 6 compounds contributed most to the characteristic off flavor of pea milk among which 2 methoxy 3 isopropyl methyl pyrazine hexanal 2 4 nonadienal and 2 4 decadienal contributed more than others . For soy milk 1 octen 3 one hexanal 2 4 nonadienal and 2 4 decadienal showed more important contributions . These odor active compounds were divided into non lipoxygenase and LOX pathways based on their synthesis . Several endogenous enzymes that are important to the LOX pathway were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and the contents of key off flavor compounds were found to be related to the enzyme activities while the lipid content was not an important factor .

@highlight Alcohols are the main flavor molecules in pea milk in soy milk it is aldehydes.
@highlight Pyrazines have the highest OAV contribution rate in pea milk.
@highlight Aldehydes have the highest OAV contribution rate in soy milk.
@highlight Endogenous precursors and LOX pathway enzymes are responsible for key off flavors.
@highlight Lipid content is a secondary factor affecting the off flavors.
