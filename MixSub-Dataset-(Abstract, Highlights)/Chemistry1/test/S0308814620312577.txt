 This paper describes a simple efficient and rapid analytical method for extraction and determination of nitrite in meat and chicken products by vortex assisted supramolecular solvent based liquid phase microextraction prior to spectrophotometric detection . The SUPRAS was rapidly formed by the addition of a colloidal decanoic acid suspension to tetrahydrofuran . The validation studies were carried out in terms of linearity limit of detection limit of quantitation matrix effects robustness uncertainty measurement precision accuracy and certified reference material analysis using optimized experimental conditions . The LOD LOQ linearity and matrix effect were 0.035ngmL

@highlight The first report on the use of SUPRAS as extraction solvents for nitrite.
@highlight UVVIS spectrophotometric were used for the determination of nitrite.
@highlight Important variables affecting the recovery of nitrite were scrutinized.
@highlight The proposed method provides very low limit of detection.
