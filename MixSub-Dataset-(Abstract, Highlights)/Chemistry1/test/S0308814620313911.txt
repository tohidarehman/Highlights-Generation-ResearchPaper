 A solid phase extraction method for enriching and purifying estrogenic disrupting compounds based on the estrogen response element was established . The estrogen receptor was used for molecular recognition as it specifically binds EDCs . An estrogen response element was used to maintain the activity of the estrogen receptor . High performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify the EDCs . This method combined with HPLC was applied to detect three kinds of EDCs such as bisphenol A 17 estradiol and diethylstilbestrol in a liquid milk matrix with recoveries of 84.18.2 to 113.62.9 . The limits of detection and quantification of the established method were 110
