 A non coding RNA is a kind of RNA that is not converted into protein however it is involved in many biological processes diseases and cancers . Numerous ncRNAs have been identified and classified with high throughput sequencing technology . Hence accurate ncRNAs class prediction is important and necessary for further study of their functions . Several computation techniques have been employed to predict the class of ncRNAs . Recent classification methods used the secondary structure as their primary input . However the computational tools of RNA secondary structure are not accurate enough which affects the final performance of ncRNAs predictors . In this paper we propose a simple yet efficient method called ncRDeep for ncRNAs prediction . It uses a simple convolutional neural network and RNA sequence information only . The ncRDeep was evaluated on benchmark datasets and the comparison results showed that the ncRDeep outperforms the state of the art methods significantly . More specifically the average accuracy was improved by 8.32 . Finally we built a freely accessible web server for the developed tool ncRDeep at
