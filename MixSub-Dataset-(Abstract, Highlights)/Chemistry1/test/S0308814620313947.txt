 Poly was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer which was then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy . The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT IR spectroscopy and UVVis spectroscopy . Next the PMel modified GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite NO

@highlight PMel was synthesized on the GCE surface via the electropolymerization of melamine.
@highlight The oxidation peaks of nitrite and tartrazine were well separated at the PMel GCE.
@highlight The developed sensor outperformed those sensors previously reported.
@highlight The PMel GCE also exhibits excellent selectivity and satisfactory reproducibility.
@highlight The sensor is used in simultaneous detection of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs.
