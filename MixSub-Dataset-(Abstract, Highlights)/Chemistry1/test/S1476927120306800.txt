 The SARS CoV 2 virus is causing COVID 19 resulting in an ongoing pandemic with serious health social and economic implications . Much research is focused in repurposing or identifying new small molecules which may interact with viral or host cell molecular targets . An important SARS CoV 2 target is the main protease M

@highlight The SARS CoV 2 main protease M
@highlight  has an important role in the viral life cycle.
@highlight Inhibition of the active site or dimerization site of M
@highlight can mitigate activity.
@highlight Mapping reveals a reactive pocket in the dimerization pocket at the apex of M
@highlight Blind docking shows that ligands may preferentially bind at the apex of M
@highlight Stable ligand interactions are formed at the active and apex sites of M
