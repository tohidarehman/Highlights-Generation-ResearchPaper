 The effect of roasting of chia seed at different temperatures on bioactive constituents in extracts and on the quality of oil was evaluated . At higher temperatures crude protein and ash contents increased whereas total phenolic flavonoid carotenoid and antioxidant activities decreased . The predominant phenolic constituents were myrcetin and rosmarinic 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic caffeic and gallic acids which all decreased with increasing temperatures . Notably myrcetin content ranged from 75.59mg 100g to 85.49mg 100g . Tocopherols were predominant nutrients and their levels ranged from 654.86mg 100g to 698.32mg 100g . Concentrations of linolenic linoleic and oleic acids from unroasted chia seeds were higher than those from roasted ones . This study revealed that chia seeds should be heated at temperatures below or equal to 90C in order to preserve their nutrient profile .

@highlight Roasting temperature can affect the quality attributes of chia seed and oil.
@highlight Higher roasting temperatures decrease the nutritional contents of chia seed and oil.
@highlight Both the individual phenolics and fatty acids in chia seed are heat sensitive.
@highlight Lower chia seed roasting temperature can result in better retention of nutrients.
