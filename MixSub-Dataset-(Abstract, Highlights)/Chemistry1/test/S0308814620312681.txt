 Hot peppers are sensitive to low temperature and seed browning significantly reduces the fruit quality . This study aims to clarify the mechanisms of seed browning in terms of metabolite changes . Metabolites were analysed during a 30 day storage period at 2C and 10C . Gamma aminobutyric acid tyrosine phenylalanine and isoleucine concentrations were significantly higher at 2C storage than at 10C . Reactive oxygen species generation was associated with seed browning . Transcription of jasmonic acid synthesis and ROS scavenging genes were higher in hot peppers stored at 2C than those stored at 10C . This study elucidated the mechanisms underlying seed browning and chill damage in hot peppers during storage at low temperatures and our findings may help improve hot peppers quality following harvesting .

@highlight Severe seed browning of hot peppers occurred after 20 d at 2C.
@highlight Increase in ROS is closely associated with seed browning.
@highlight Tyrosine and phenylalanine were the major metabolites observed in brown seeds.
@highlight The Jasmonic acid pathway is activated during storage at 2C.
