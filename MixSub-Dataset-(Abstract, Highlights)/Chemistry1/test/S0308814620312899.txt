 A magnetic porous organic framework was rationally designed and served as a sorbent for magnetic solid phase extraction of six nitroimidazoles from chicken meat prior to their assay by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection . The M POF exhibited good magnetic responsiveness and outstanding affinity to nitroimidazoles with large adsorption capacity up to 36mgg

@highlight Magnetic POF was prepared using tetraphenylethylene as building unit.
@highlight The M POF showed excellent adsorption capability for nitromidazoles.
@highlight A sensitive method was established for extracting nitromidazoles in chicken meat.
@highlight The M POF can serve as a promising adsorbent for other adsorption applications.
