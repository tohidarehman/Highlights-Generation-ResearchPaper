 Plant fungal diseases have been affecting the world s agricultural production and economic levels for a long time such as rice blast gray tomato mold potato late blight etc . Recent studies have shown that fungal pathogens transmit microRNA as an effector to host plants for infection . However bioassay based verification analysis is time consuming and challenging and it is difficult to analyze from a global perspective . With the accumulation of fungal and plant related data data analysis methods can be used to analyze pathogenic fungal microRNA further . Based on the microRNA expression data of fungal pathogens infecting plants before and after this paper discusses the selection strategy of sample data the extraction strategy of pathogenic fungal microRNA the prediction strategy of a fungal pathogenic microRNA target gene the bicluster based fungal pathogenic microRNA functional analysis strategy and experimental verification methods . A general analysis pipeline based on machine learning and bicluster based function module was proposed for plant fungal pathogenic microRNA.The pipeline proposed in this paper is applied to the infection process of Magnaporthe oryzae and the infection process of potato late blight . It has been verified to prove the feasibility of the pipeline . It can be extended to other relevant crop pathogen research providing a new idea for fungal research on plant diseases . It can be used as a reference for understanding the interaction between fungi and plants .

@highlight Propose a general analysis pipeline based on machine learning and bicluster based function module for plant fungal pathogenic microRNA.
@highlight The feasibility has been verified through the infection process of Magnaporthe oryzae and the infection process of potato late blight.
@highlight It can be extended to other related crop pathogen research providing a reference for understanding the interaction between fungi and plants.
