 Zero salted yellow alkaline noodles were immersed in solutions of resistant starch HYLON VII or fruit coating Semperfresh containing a range of salt between 10 and 30 . The objective was to evaluate the effect of salt coatings on the textural handling cooking and sensory properties of YAN . Increasing salt in the coatings caused a reduction in optimum cooking time cooking loss and increase in cooking yield . The mechanical and textural parameters sensory hardness springiness and overall sensory acceptability of the salt coated noodles however decreased with increasing salt application . HC Na10 and SC Na10 showed the highest textural and mechanical parameters sensory hardness and springiness . The differences in the parameters were attributed mainly to the water absorption properties of starch that was affected by salt application . Thus the quality of salt coated noodles was dependent mainly on the amounts of salt applied in the coatings rather than on the types of coatings used .

@highlight coatings containing salt range 1030 w v .
@highlight Increasing salt application reduced optimum cooking time and cooking loss but increased cooking yield.
@highlight Increasing salt concentration exhibited higher L values.
@highlight Salt coatings with 10 salt showed the highest textural mechanical parameters and sensory evaluation values.
@highlight The properties of noodles were influenced by salt from the coatings and to a lesser extent the type of coatings used.
