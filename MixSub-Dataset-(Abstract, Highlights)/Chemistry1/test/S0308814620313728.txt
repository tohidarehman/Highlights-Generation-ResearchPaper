 Aqueous coenzyme Q10 dispersions were prepared using sugary maize dendrimer like glucan with solid dispersion treatment . After measuring solubility recovery rate and loading rate the initial weight ratio of CoQ10 SMDG was optimized to be 1 27 with the solubility markedly increasing up 188.8 folds compared to pure CoQ10 solution . The structural characterizations of CoQ10 SMDG formulation showed crystal CoQ10 was entrapped in SMDG matrix for amorphous state associated with the strong interactions with glucan chains . The antioxidant activity of CoQ10 SMDG was assessed via DPPH and FRAP assay . DPPH scavenging activity and FRAP value of it were as high as 95.1 and 0.87mM respectively . The cellular uptake of CoQ10 in CoQ10 SMDG group was significantly higher than that of natural CoQ10 . CoQ10 SMDG also exhibited significant protective effects against cellular damage in H
