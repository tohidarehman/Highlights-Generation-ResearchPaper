 Neurodegenerative diseases have complex etiology and pose a challenge to scientists to develop simple and cost effective synthetic compounds as potential drug candidates for such diseases . Here we report an extension of our previously published

@highlight tools including MD simulation and MMGBSA were used to identify two cost effective compounds as AChE inhibitors.
@highlight Selected compounds were also screened against BChE LOX and glucosidase.
@highlight Compound
@highlight significantly diminish AChE levels in the mice brain as compared to the control.
