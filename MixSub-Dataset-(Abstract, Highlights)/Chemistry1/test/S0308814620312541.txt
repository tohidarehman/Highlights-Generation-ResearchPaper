 The present work describes a novel and rapid approach for evaluating total phenolic compounds in tea and fruits using colorimetric spots and the digital image based method . Colorimetric spots were formed by reacting diazotized aminobenzenes namely sulfanilic acid sulfanilamide or aniline with TPCs in the extract to form an azo dye . The limit of detection was 6.5 5.5 or 5.1mg GAE L

@highlight New colorimetric Spots for total phenolic compounds TPCs .
@highlight Fast and reliable digital image based DIB method.
@highlight Application to TPCs determination in tea and fruits.
@highlight Comparison to the reference Folin Ciocalteu method.
