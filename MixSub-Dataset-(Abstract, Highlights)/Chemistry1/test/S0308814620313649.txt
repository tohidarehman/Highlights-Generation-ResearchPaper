 The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of ethanol ultrasound and or vacuum as a pretreatment to melon drying . Eight types of pretreatments were performed in which samples were immersed in ethanol solutions with different concentrations using four treatment conditions immersion immersion with ultrasound with vacuum and with ultrasound and vacuum . Drying was performed at 60C and five different semi theoretical drying mathematical models were examined to characterize the drying curves and quality analyses were carried out . The condition that obtained the lower drying time was using the US pretreatment in 100 ethanol solution . Drying caused a diminution of bioactive compounds and influenced color parameters . However the samples immersed in 50 ethanol solution and dried obtained minor losses of total phenolics total carotenoids and ascorbic acid contents .

@highlight Ethanol ultrasound and or vacuum was used as a pretreatment to melon drying.
@highlight Drying rates could be improved by using ethanol and ultrasound pretreatment.
@highlight Associating ethanol 50 ultrasound and or vacuum reduced quality loss.
