 By products of Belgian endive represent an interesting yet underutilised source of dietary fibre . Dietary fibre concentrates that are low in sugar and neutral in taste are sought by the food industry to increase DF content and improve texture in food products . The aim was to set up a biorefinery process to produce DFC from forced roots of Belgian endive and characterise the resulting product . As a control non treated forced roots powder was tested . Water extraction significantly decreased the content of sugars phenolic acids and sesquiterpene lactones in DFC BE . In contrast total dietary fibre concentration was higher in DFC BE in comparison to FRP BE . DFC BE offers an excellent water holding capacity of 14.71g water g DW and a swelling capacity of 23.46mL water g DW suggesting possible use as a functional food ingredient .

@highlight A dietary fibre concentrate DFC BE from Belgian endive by products was produced and characterised.
@highlight The obtained powder was tasteless low in sugars and rich in insoluble dietary fibres.
@highlight DFC BE exhibited excellent hydration properties.
@highlight DFC BE presented potential as fibre rich functional ingredient.
