 In this study we tested the exogenous application of phytosulfokine for delaying the yellowing of broccoli florets during cold storage . Our results showed that the lower yellowing in broccoli florets treated with 150nM PSK was probably due to the higher endogenous accumulation of PSK leading to the endogenous accumulation of guanosine 3 5 cyclic monophosphate . Besides broccoli florets treated with 150nM PSK exhibited a higher accumulation of phenols and flavonoids by triggering gene expression and activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase
