 The objectives of the present work were to investigate the influence of Gum Arabic on the physicochemical properties and ultra high temperature processability of lactoglobulin stabilized

@highlight Physically stable
@highlight  limonene bilayer emulsions were prepared with 2wt GA.
@highlight The droplet characteristics and stability of the
@highlight  limonene emulsions were examined.
@highlight Bilayer emulsions had a higher physico chemical stability against UHT treatment.
@highlight The antimicrobial effects of the bilayer emulsions was shown to be dose dependent.
