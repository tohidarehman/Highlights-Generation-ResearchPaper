 This study aimed to investigate the difference between ginger slices and splits during microwave vacuum drying procedures . MVD ginger slices showed a higher shrinkage rate and a higher hardness value with a more porous structure of the surface layer . MVD ginger splits had higher rehydration rates at the first 15min of the rehydration . Nine optimal wavelengths were selected by regression coefficients from the partial least squares regression model based on the raw data . A simplified PLSR model based on optimal wavelengths showed a good performance with a coefficient of determination in prediction

@highlight MVD ginger slices showed higher shrinkage rates and hardness than splits.
@highlight MVD ginger splits had higher rehydration rates than slices at the beginning.
@highlight The surface layer of MVD ginger slices showed more porous than that of splits.
@highlight A more uniform moisture distribution was found in MVD original ginger slices.
