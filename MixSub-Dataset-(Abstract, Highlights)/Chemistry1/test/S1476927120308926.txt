 The present work proposed the preparation of triazolic analogues of tyrosol a biophenol found in olive oil and whose wide range of bioactivities has been the target of many studies . We obtained fifteen novel tyrosol derivatives and the compounds of the series were later evaluated as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . The study of AChE inhibition is important for the development of new drugs and pesticides and especially the research for managing Alzheimer s disease . The most active compound namely 7 ethyl 1

@highlight Tyrosol derivatives and 1 2 3 triazoles are potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
@highlight Derived from 4 methylumbelliferone 
@highlight  showed an IC
@highlight value of 14.662.29mol L
@highlight Kinetic study and computational simulation suggested competitive inhibition mechanism
@highlight High potential prototypes for the development of new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
@highlight Development of new drugs and pesticides including for managing Alzheimer s disease
