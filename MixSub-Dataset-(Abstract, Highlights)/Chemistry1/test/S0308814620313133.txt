 Castration may decrease off odors and improve meat flavor . Meat flavor is generated through complex chemical reactions that involve hydrophilic and hydrophobic flavor precursors . In this study we investigated the flavor precursors in psoas major muscles of castrated and intact sheep using lipidomics and targeted metabolomics . Castration decreased testosterone levels and increased intramuscular fat content . Six hundred fourteen lipid molecules confirmed showed a separation between castrated and intact sheep based on principal component analysis . Fourteen lipid species and 224 lipid molecules increased in castrated sheep . Targeted metabolomics analysis showed that 18 hydrophilic metabolites were affected by castration however only hypoxanthine significantly increased in the castration group . Among 45 volatiles identified 1 octen 3 ol and hexanal were significantly higher in castrated sheep . These results revealed that lipids hydrophilic metabolites and volatile compounds in lamb were affected by castration which might be beneficial in lamb quality .
