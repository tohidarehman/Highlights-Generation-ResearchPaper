 Endogenous lipase and lipoxygenase play important roles in accelerating lipid oxidation . Polyphenols are a series of commonly used chemicals for preserving fish and seafood products due to their positive inhibitory effects on lipid oxidation . However the mechanism involved is still unknown . The inhibitory effects of chlorogenic acid on lipase and lipoxygenase were investigated and explored with multi spectroscopic and molecular docking approaches . Results showed that CGA could inhibit the activities of lipase and lipoxygenase with concentration increased in a highly dose dependent manner . CGA quenched intrinsic fluorescence intensities of enzymes by static quenching and binding with CGA which led to changes in 3D structures of enzymes . Results of the molecular docking confirmed binding modes binding sites and major interaction forces between CGA and enzymes which reduced the corresponding activity . Thus this study could provide basic mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of polyphenols on lipid oxidation during food preservation .
