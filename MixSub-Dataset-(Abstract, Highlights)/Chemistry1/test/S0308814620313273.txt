 The comparative study was performed in order to assess the most suitable matrix polymer for ascorbyl palmitate . The antioxidant was loaded into the 75 25 blend films based on polysaccharides octenyl succinic anhydride modified starch water soluble soy polysaccharides and gelatin . The AP was present in the films both in the form of longitudinal crystals and microglobules . Because of amphiphilic character the AP had the moisturizing action on the films however its addition reduced film solubility in water . AP did not affect the water vapor permeability and tensile strength of the OSA based carrier . The Makoid Banakar with T

@highlight Ascorbyl palmitate AP increases H
@highlight O content while reduces film pH and solubility.
@highlight AP increases yellowness opacity and UV barrier capacity of the films.
@highlight AP improves the barrier properties and durability of gum Arabic GAR gelatin film.
@highlight GAR offers controlled release of AP thus prolonged antioxidant activity.
@highlight Octenyl succinic anhydride modified starch OSA offers fast release of AP.
