 In this paper theoretical study on molecular geometry vibrational pharmaceutical and electronic properties of the monomeric and dimeric structures of 1 benzothiophene 2 carboxylic acid were carried out using B3LYP hybrid functional with 6 311 G as basis set . The structural study show that the stability of 2BT crystalline structure arising from O HO C HO as well as S HO hydrogen bonding interactions . Vibrational analysis for monomer and dimer species show a good compatibility between experimental and theoretical frequencies . Then the 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts were calculated using Gauge Independent Atomic Orbital technical . In addition the UV Vis spectrum was simulated in gas phase and in water throughout TD DFT calculation . The electronic transitions were identified based on HOM LUMO energies . However donor acceptor interactions and charge delocalization has been studied via natural bond orbital . The nucleophilic and electrophilic site localization is identified by molecular electrostatic potential . Hirshfeld surface analysis has been discussed based on color code demonstrating the various non covalent interactions . Besides molecular docking analysis was reported to evince the pharmaceutical properties of the studied molecule .
