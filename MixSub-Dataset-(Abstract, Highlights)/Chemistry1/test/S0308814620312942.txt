 The sensory qualities and shelf life of tea beverage strongly affected by tea cream that forms by the interaction of polyphenols and protein . The study aimed to investigate the effects of the interactions between tea polyphenols and bovine serum albumin on tea cream formation at different concentrations . The tea cream formation increased with TPs and BSA concentration increased . The optimal concentration for high clarities and contents of phytochemicals was selected by the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution . The interaction mechanism of TPs BSA was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy UVvisible absorption spectroscopy synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking . TPs interacted with BSA via static quenching process affecting tryptophan and tyrosine residue microenvironment of BSA . Ester catechins had more binding affinity than non ester catechins . Hydrogen bonds were the main interaction forces of TPs BSA .

@highlight The optimal solution TPs 800mg L BSA 40mg L was gained by TOPSIS method.
@highlight EGCG and ECG had more bind abilities to interact with BSA than EGC and EC.
@highlight The quenching mechanism of BSA against EGCG ECG EGC and EC is static quenching.
@highlight Hydrogen bonds were the main driving force between TPs and BSA in this condition.
