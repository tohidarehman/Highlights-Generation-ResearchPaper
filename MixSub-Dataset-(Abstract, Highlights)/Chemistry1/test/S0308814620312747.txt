 In this study metabolomics and proteomics were employed to investigate the change mechanism of nonvolatile compounds during white tea processing . A total of 99 nonvolatile compounds were identified among which the contents of 13 free amino acids caffeine theaflavins 7 nucleosides and nucleotides and 5 flavone glycosides increased significantly while the contents of theanine catechins theasinesins 3 proanthocyanidins and phenolic acids decreased significantly during the withering period . The results of proteomics indicated that the degradation of proteins accounted for the increase in free amino acid levels the weakened biosynthesis in addition to oxidation also contributed to the decrease in flavonoid levels the degradation of ribonucleic acids contributed to the increase in nucleoside and nucleotide levels during the withering period . In addition the drying process was found to slightly promote the formation of white tea taste . Our study provides a novel characterization of white tea taste formation during processing .
