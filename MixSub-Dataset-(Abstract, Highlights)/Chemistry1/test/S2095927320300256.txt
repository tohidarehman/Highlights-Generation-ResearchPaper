 Ternary strategy has been considered as an efficient method to achieve high performance polymer solar cells . A power conversion efficiency of 17.22 is achieved in the optimized ternary PSCs with 10wt MF1 in acceptors . The over 8 PCE improvement by employing ternary strategy is attributed to the simultaneously increased

@highlight Raman mapping images provide intuitive evidences on good compatibility of MF1 and Y6.
@highlight MF1 and Y6 prefer to form alloy like state in ternary active layers.
@highlight The optimized ternary PSCs achieve a PCE of 17.22 and a certified PCE of 16.8 .
