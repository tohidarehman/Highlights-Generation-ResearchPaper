 Insects represent a novel source of edible high nutritional value proteins which are gaining increasing interest as an alternative to traditional animal foods . In this work cricket flour was used to produce gluten free sourdough breads suitable for celiac people and source of proteins . The doughs were fermented by different methods and pH and microbial growth volatile compounds protein profile and antioxidant activity before and after baking were analyzed and compared to standard gluten free doughs . The results showed that cricket enriched doughs and the standard had similar fermentation processes . Cricket enrichment conferred to the breads a typical flavoring profile characterized by a unique bouquet of volatile compounds made by nonanoic acid 2 4 nonadienal 1 hexanol 1 heptanol and 3 octen 2 one expressed in different amounts depending on the type of inoculum . Finally antioxidant activities were significantly enhanced in cricket breads indicating that cricket powder provides to bakery gluten free goods high nutritional value proteins and antioxidant properties .
