 Peptidyl post translational modifications could influence the final quality of processed meat . In this study the peptide oxidative phenomena in Spanish dry cured ham

@highlight Lipid and protein oxidation in dry cured ham were processing time dependent.
@highlight The generation of free amino acids remained intense during ripening drying.
@highlight Myosin light chain sequences formed stable acetaldehyde adducts
@highlight Michael addition.
@highlight Chemometrics indicated a differential pattern in deamidated and oxidized peptides.
@highlight Bioinformatics discriminated the susceptibility of myosin heavy chain to deamidation.
