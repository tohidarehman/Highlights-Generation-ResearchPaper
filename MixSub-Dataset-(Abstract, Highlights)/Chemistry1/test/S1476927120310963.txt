 We previously reported that activating transcription factor 3 an adaptive response gene plays a dichotomous role in regulating several molecular processes during breast cancer progression . ATF3 promoted the expression of runt related transcription factor 2 and activated matrix metalloproteinase 13 thereby fostering proliferation and bone metastasis of the breast cancer cells . Targeting ATF3 may mitigate the metastatic spread of breast cancer and improve the patients lifespan . Non coding RNAs such as microRNAs long non coding RNAs and circular RNAs are the new era regimens that are currently utilized for diagnosis and treatment of a variety of malignancies including cancer . mir 3674 putatively targets ATF3 but its expression was significantly increased in human breast cancer cells compared to normal human mammary epithelial cells . Our in silico analysis identified a few lncRNAs and circRNAs showing their putative binding sites for miR 3674 . Thus mir 3674 despite its abundance in the MDA MB231 cells could not effectively target ATF3 which could be due to the sponging mechanism of lncRNAs and circRNAs towards mir 3674 . More extensive in vitro and in vivo studies are required to validate this and expand the diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives of breast cancer .

@highlight ATF3 overexpression correlated with breast cancer progression.
@highlight analysis identified the miRNAs that putatively target ATF3.
@highlight Expression of mir 3674 ATF3 target increased in human breast cancer cells.
@highlight A sponging effect of miR 3674 by lncRNAs for non targeting of ATF3 was speculated.
