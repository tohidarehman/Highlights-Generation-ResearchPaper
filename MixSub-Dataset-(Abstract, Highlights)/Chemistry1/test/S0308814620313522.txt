 The aims of this study were to evaluate the role of encapsulant materials on the stability of bioactive compounds of red ginger extract powder during storage and determine the composition of the encapsulant materials which produced red ginger extract powder with best stability of bioactive compounds during storage . This study consisted of three compositions of encapsulant materials which are maltodextrin gum arabic with ratio 10 0 8 2 and 5 5 . The results showed that several compositions of encapsulant materials produced different stability of bioactive compounds of red ginger extract powder . Based on the study result increasing amount of gum arabic used had better protection to the stability of bioactive compounds of the powders during storage .
