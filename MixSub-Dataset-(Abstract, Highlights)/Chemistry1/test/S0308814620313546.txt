 In this study recombinant rice quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase was expressed and characterized and its performance in flour processing quality was further evaluated . The purified rQSOX exhibited the highest sulfhydryl oxidation activity using dithiothreitol as a substrate accompanying the production of H

@highlight rQSOX catalyzed the oxidation of DTT accompanying the production of H
@highlight The optimal temperature and pH for rQSOX catalyzing DTT oxidation was 60C and pH 8.0.
@highlight Addition of rQSOX strengthened viscoelastic properties of dough and gluten network structure.
@highlight Addition of rQSOX increased the specific volume and decreased the hardness of steamed bread.
