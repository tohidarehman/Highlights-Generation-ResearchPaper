 The aim of the study was to comprehensively evaluate the associations between tumor necrosis factor gene polymorphism and influenza A susceptibility . The relevant studies were identified through a search of PubMed Embase and Cochrane library database until February 29 2020 without language restrictions . Two independent reviewers extracted the data and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus . The quality of the eligible article was evaluated by Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale . Eggers test was applied to evaluate publication bias . All these analyses were performed using Stata15.1 software . A total of 5 studies with 474 cases and 805 controls were included . The results of meta analysis showed that there were statistically significant for rs361525 in allelic model and for rs1800750 in dominant model in cases vs. controls . Furthermore subgroup analysis for race showed that for rs361525 in allelic model there were significant differences for Caucasian and no significant difference for Mexican in cases vs. controls . There was publication bias for rs361525 in dominant model and rs1800629 in recessive model . Caucasian with A site mutation of 238TNF G A was more susceptible to influenza A .The 376 dominant model AA GA of TNF genes was associated with the susceptibility to influenza A . However more studies with large sample size are needed to confirm the results .
