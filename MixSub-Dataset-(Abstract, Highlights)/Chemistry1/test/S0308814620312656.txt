 Oil foams that are based on oleogels are stabilized by the presence of crystalline particles at the air bubble surface and in bulk . The size of crystalline particles is an important parameter in oil foam stabilization . The creation process can tune its properties . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of altering the weight ratio between long chain fatty acids and fatty alcohols on the oil foam . Two optimal weight ratios R 7 3 and R 8 2 for which mixed crystals were present produced the best foams in terms of overrun foam firmness and foam stability . R not only affected the crystal size but also the number of crystalline particles present in the oleogel . Mixed crystals help to produce and stabilize the foams . We highlighted that there is a link between the oleogel stability and hardness with their resulting oleofoam properties .

@highlight The weight ratio of the fatty alcohol fatty acid system tunes oil foams properties.
@highlight Two specific weight ratios give the best foam stability.
@highlight Oleogels with high stability and hardness give better oil foam properties.
@highlight Large crystals are linked to short foam lifetime and to low foamability.
@highlight The weight ratio is a better parameter to improve foam properties than cooling rate.
