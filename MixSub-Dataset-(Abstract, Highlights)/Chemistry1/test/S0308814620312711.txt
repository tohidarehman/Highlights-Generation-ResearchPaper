 This work reports a new method to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of infusions and beverages based on superoxide radicals . Radicals produced by the enzymatic reaction between acetylcholinesterase and hypoxanthine oxidized antioxidant molecules present in commercially available samples or standard solutions which was monitored by means of cyclic voltammetry using a carbon paste electrode . The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of red wine coffee and green tea determined using this method were and respectively . This method suggested TEAC

@highlight New method for evaluation of commercial samples antioxidant capacity is reported.
@highlight Antioxidant capacity is calculated through the use of superoxide radicals.
@highlight Antioxidant capacity of red wine coffee and green tea is evaluated.
@highlight The method is fast inexpensive and can be easily implemented.
