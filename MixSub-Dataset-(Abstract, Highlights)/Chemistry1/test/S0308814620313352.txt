 This study aimed at investigating two strategies to enhance the bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds from whole wheat breads enzymatic bioprocessing and addition of green coffee infusion . Although both strategies had a significant effect on increasing the contents of total soluble phenolic compounds in breads the addition of green coffee infusion was much more relevant than enzymatic bioprocessing . The phenolic compounds present as soluble forms were completely released from all breads matrix already at the oral phase of digestion . While gastric digestion did not promote the release of insoluble phenolic compounds intestinal conditions led to a slight release . All bread samples showed maximum phenolic compounds bioaccessibility after 4h of gut fermentation . Upon the end of

@highlight Green coffee infusion addition increased soluble phenolics in bread.
@highlight Green coffee addition increased bioaccessible phenolics after
@highlight digestion.
@highlight Enzymatic bioprocessing increased bioaccessible phenolics after
@highlight digestion.
@highlight Enzymatic bioprocessing accelerated ferulic acid release during gut fermentation.
@highlight Green coffee infusion addition increased overall phenolics bioaccessibility.
