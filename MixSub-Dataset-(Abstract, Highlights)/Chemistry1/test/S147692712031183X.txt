 Caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 the COVID 19 pandemic is ongoing with no proven safe and effective vaccine to date . Further effective therapeutic agents for COVID 19 are limited and as a result the identification of potential small molecule antiviral drugs is of particular importance . A critical antiviral target is the SARS CoV 2 main protease M
