 Sorghum derived 3 deoxyanthocyanin pigments are stable relative to their anthocyanin analogs and are of growing interest in food applications . However the 3DXA are poorly extractable from grain tissue . This work aimed to determine the relative stability and extractability of sorghum 3 DXA vs anthocyanins from maize and cowpea under microwave assisted extraction . UVVis and UPLC MS MS spectrometry were used to characterize the properties . The 3 DXA remained structurally stable to MAE conditions up to 1200W 100C 30min . MAE increased sorghum 3 DXA yield 100 versus control . On the other hand both maize and cowpea anthocyanins were unstable and rapidly degraded under MAE . Cell wall derived ferulate esters were detected in sorghum and maize MAE extracts indicating cell wall degradation occurred during MAE . Thus the enhanced extraction of 3 DXA under MAE was due to their structural stability along with improved diffusion from cell matrix due to microwave induced sorghum cell wall disruption .
