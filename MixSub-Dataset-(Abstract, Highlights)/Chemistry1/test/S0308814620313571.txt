 Various pesticides employed in modern agriculture result in large amounts of pesticide residues in agricultural production greatly threatening human health . Herein we report a facile approach to fabricate a reduced graphene oxide cyclodextrin modified glassy carbon electrode for the sensitive electrochemical sensing of imidacloprid . Three different modified electrodes using CDs

@highlight A novel reduced graphene oxide cyclodextrin rGO CD nanocomposite was prepared.
@highlight Electrochemical rGO CD E rGO CD presented higher electrocatalytic activity.
@highlight Electrochemical behaviors of and CD modified electrodes were investigated.
@highlight A sensitive imidacloprid electrochemical sensor based on E rGO CD was built.
