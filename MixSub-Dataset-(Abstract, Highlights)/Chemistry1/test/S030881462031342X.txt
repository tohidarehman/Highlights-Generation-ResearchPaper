 Acrylamide is a toxic industrial chemical but is also found in heated potato foods such as French fries due to the Maillard reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars . However high temperature cooking is often required for flavoring browning and sterilizing of raw ingredients . Imidazole dipeptides such as carnosine alanyl

@highlight Imidazole dipeptides were shown to quench acrylamide by adduct formation.
@highlight All chemical structures were identified in reaction between imidazole dipeptides and acrylamide.
@highlight An LCESI SRM MS method was developed for all the adducts.
@highlight Adduct formations were confirmed in model stir frying conditions with potato and chicken.
