 The mechanism of flavor retention in chicken broth from the perspective of gelatin affecting the flavor binding ability of emulsions was investigated . Results showed that fat was the important reservoir for aroma compounds in the emulsion . The particle sizes of emulsions significantly decreased with prolonged stewing time of gelatin which was consistent with the results from confocal laser scanning microscopy and interfacial tension . The ability of pre heated gelatin emulsions to bind volatile compounds with higher hydrophobicity was enhanced . When 0.1 gelatin was added into chicken broth the total amount of the main volatile compounds increased from 458.83ng g to 1218.42ng g. In summary the pre heated gelatin increased the interfacial pressure of water oil interface resulting in a smaller particle size of oil droplets and these further increased the binding area between oil droplets and flavor compounds . This appears to be the mechanism that gelatin enhances the flavor intensity of chicken broth .

@highlight Thermally treated gelatin increased the interfacial pressure of the W O interface.
@highlight The particle size of emulsions stabilized by pre heated gelatin reduced.
@highlight Exogenous addition of gelatin can enhance the flavor strength of chicken broth.
