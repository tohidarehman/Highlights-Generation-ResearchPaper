 The Programmed cell Death protein 1 Ligand 1 checkpoint is a major target in oncology . Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD 1 or PD L1 are used to treat different types of solid tumors and lymphoma . PD L1 binding small molecules are also actively searched . The lead compound is the biphenyl drug BMS 202 which stabilizes PD L1 protein dimers and displays a potent antitumor activity in experimental models . Here we have investigated the effect of N glycosylation and mono ubiquitination of PD L1 on the interaction with BMS 202 by molecular modeling . Two complementary tridimensional models of PD L1 based on available crystallographic structures were constructed with BMS 202 bound . The structures were glycosylated with a fucosylated bi antennary N glycan and ubiquitinated . Model 1 refers to glycoPD L1 bearing 16 N glycans with or without 4 ubiquitin residues . Model 2 presents 8 N glycans and 2 ubiquitin residues . In both cases BMS 202 was bound to the protein interface stabilizing a PD L1 dimer . The incorporation of the N glycans or the ubiquitins did not significantly alter the drug protein recognition . The interface of the drug stabilized protein dimer is unaffected by the glycosylation or ubiquitination . Calculations of the binding energies indicated that the glycosylation slightly reduces the stability of the drug protein complexes but does not prevent the drug binding process . Our modeling study suggests that the drug can target efficiently the different forms of PD L1 in cells glycosylated ubiquitinated or not . These models of N glycosylated and ubiquitinated PD L1 will be useful to study other PD L1 protein complexes .

@highlight Proteins PD 1 and PD L1 Programmed cell Death protein 1 Ligand 1 are major glycoprotein targets in oncology.
@highlight We designed two complementary models of protein PD L1 with full N glycosylation and ubiquitination.
@highlight N glycosylation and ubiquitination do not impede the stabilization of the protein dimer by the anticancer drug BMS 202.
@highlight The drug can target the different glycoforms of the protein.
