 Benzotriazoles and benzothiazoles are two groups of emerging concern and high production volume contaminants . Via the biomagnification of the food web they could jeopardize human health . In this work rapid determining the presence of five BTRs and two BTs in marketed fish was performed by a novel double vortex ultrasonic assisted matrix solid phase dispersion and UHPLC electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry detection . Unlike traditional MSPD we simplified the method without the use of mortar pestle and SPE column procedures . The DVUA MSPD factors were screened by a multilevel categorical design and then optimized by Box Behnken Design plus with response surface methodology . The limits of quantification were 0.152ngg

@highlight The mortar pestle free and SPE column free DVUA MSPD method was developed.
@highlight The factors were screened and optimized by statistic experimental design methods.
@highlight LOQ were 0.152ngg
@highlight  dry weight and high precisions ranged from 1 to 9 .
@highlight Trace levels of BTRs 46.276.4ngg
@highlight  and BTs 15.426.1ngg
