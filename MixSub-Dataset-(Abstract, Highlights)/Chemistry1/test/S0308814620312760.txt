 The reasons for the change in the water retention capability of salted pork caused by potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride were investigated . Accompanied by the gradually increased substitution rate of KCl the oxidative degradation of protein water content water activity a

@highlight NaCl replaced by KCl leads to oxidative degradation of proteins in salted pork.
@highlight The KCl leads to salted pork with higher water content.
@highlight The KCl results high pore levels in the salted pork with uniformity of the pore diameter.
@highlight There are good correlations between protein changes and NMR measures in salted pork.
