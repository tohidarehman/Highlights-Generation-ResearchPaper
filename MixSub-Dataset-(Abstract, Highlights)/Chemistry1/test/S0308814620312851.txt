 The aim of this work was to study the effect of thickness of samples air velocity and infrared power on the drying kinetics and quality attributes of blanched eggplant slices during infrared drying . The drying experiments were made by Response Surface Methodology based on a BoxBehnken design . Experiments were conducted at a thickness of 3 5 and 7mm air velocity of 0.5 1.25 and 2m s as well as at infrared power 1000 1500 and 2000W . The drying time was affected by operating parameters . The drying processes increased total phenolic content and potassium content significantly . The total color difference

@highlight The drying were evaluated in different slice thicknesses air velocity and infrared power.
@highlight The total phenol content of dried eggplants were increased by 17326 .
@highlight The potassium content of dried eggplants were increased by 709.11236.3 .
@highlight The optimal conditions were determined by response surface methodology.
