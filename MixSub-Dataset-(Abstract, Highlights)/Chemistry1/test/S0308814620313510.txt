 To improve the utilization of cod skin collagen peptides we heated them with xylose at 80C 100C and 120C for up to 150min to prepare xylose CSCP Maillard reaction products and then investigated their physicochemical and functional properties . The results showed that Arg Lys Phe and Asp were the major amino acids involved in the Maillard reaction . After being heated at 120C for 150min the ABTS scavenging activity and reducing power of xylose CSCP MRPs were 99.59 and 0.887 absorbance units respectively . Xylose CSCP MRPs had better emulsifying properties and foaming properties than CSCP . Furthermore 26 volatile compounds including 2 5 dimethyl pyrazine and 2 ethyl 3 5 dimethylpyrazine were identified from xylose CSCP MRPs by gas chromatography ion mobility spectrometry . Newly formed heterocyclic compounds might be responsible for the flavor and antioxidant capacity of xylose CSCP MRPs . These results suggest the potential for xylose CSCP MRPs to serve as functional food ingredients .

@highlight The functional and processing properties of xylose CSCP MRPs were first elucidated.
@highlight High temperature 120C contributed to the formation of low MW components in MRPs.
@highlight Conjugation with xylose increased the emulsifying and foaming properties of CSCP.
@highlight A total of 26 volatile compounds were identified in xylose CSCP MRPs by GC IMS.
