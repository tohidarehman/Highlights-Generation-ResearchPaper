 Different baking conditions were used in order to evaluate its effects on bread aspects . Doughs were baked at 160 190 and 220C during 9 12 15 and 20min and characterized in relation to color change oxalate and mineral concentration and protein digestibility . The higher the baking temperature and time the higher the crust color change the lower the oxalate concentration and the higher the amount of some macro minerals . Protein digestibility may also be favored however it does not follow a linear correlation . Although it is not possible to obtain a condition that favors the content of all minerals protein digestibility and reduces oxalate content the use of high temperatures and times is important as it can reduce oxalate and thereby prevent its associated problems . Understanding how to optimize it during baking could be used to produce breads with a higher mineral bioavailability an important strategy for food industry and also when using alternative flours .

@highlight Baking parameters is an important strategy to enhance nutritional aspects.
@highlight Oxalate concentration is reduced by using higher temperatures.
@highlight Color variations were not related to the lower in nutritional properties.
@highlight Steam introduction could enhance protein digestibility.
@highlight Mineral concentration could be enhanced by oxalate reduction.
