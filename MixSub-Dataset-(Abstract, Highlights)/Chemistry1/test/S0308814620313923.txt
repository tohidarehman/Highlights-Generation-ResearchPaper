 Soybean protein isolate was incubated with flaxseed gum at 60C for 3days under high hydrostatic pressure . Results showed improvement in solubility of SPI upon glycation with FG . The maximum solubility reached 86.84 when SPI FG was treated at pH 8.0 and 200MPa . The occurrence degrees and sites of SPI FG glycation suggested that moderate pressure significantly promoted Maillard reactions but higher pressures suppressed these reactions . The secondary structure of the glycated proteins varied greatly with respect to helix and random coil contents and vibrations of the amide II band at 200MPa . These microstructural changes increased the solubility over a broad pH range . The conformational changes in the glycated SPI supported the improved solubility of SPI FG . Overall HHP represents a potential method of controlling glycation to improve protein processability and expand their applicability in the food industry .

@highlight Soy protein isolate was glycated with flaxseed gum under high hydrostatic pressure.
@highlight Glycated protein solubility reached a maximum 86.48 at high pressure 200MPa .
@highlight High pressure decreased glycation sites number determined by nano HPLC MS MS.
@highlight The second structure of the soy protein was altered by these modifications.
