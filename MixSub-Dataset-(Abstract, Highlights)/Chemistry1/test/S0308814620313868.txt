 Semicarbazide is a protein bound nitrofurazone metabolite that is detrimental to human health . Therefore to ensure food safety it is necessary to detect SEM in food samples . To this end we developed a novel electrochemical sensor to detect SEM by using a molecularly imprinted polymer as the recognition element . Computer aided molecular modelling was performed to guide the synthesis of the MIP and subsequently MIP carboxylated single walled carbon nanotubes chitosan was prepared as the sensing platform to develop the electrochemical sensor . The linear range of the sensor was 0.047.6ngmL
