 Comparison of compounds similarity is one of the main strategies of virtual screening protocols . Both similarity and dissimilarity concepts are of great importance during the search for new active compounds . Similarity is important due to the assumption that underlies the process of searching for new drug candidates structurally similar compounds should induce similar biological response . On the other hand we are also interested in dissimilarity as we usually aim to find structurally novel ligands . In the study we compared several approaches of evaluating compound similarity . Various representations and metrics were applied and we indicated the rate of variation of the results that can occur when shifting from one strategy to another . We compared both general similarity of datasets using different approaches as well as examined the changes in the set of nearest neighbors when changing one compound representation into another and the influence of representation metric settings on the clustering outcome . We hope that the study will be of great help during the preparation of virtual screening experiments stressing the need for careful selection of the way the compound similarity is assessed . The differences in the results that can be obtained via the application of particular strategy can significantly influence the outcome of comparison studies therefore its settings should be carefully selected beforerunning the comparison .

@highlight Compound similarity assessment constitutes basis for a number of virtual screening protocols.
@highlight The results of similarity assessment vary depending on the compound representation and metric.
@highlight Settings for similarity searching tasks should be carefully selected before the running the comparison.
