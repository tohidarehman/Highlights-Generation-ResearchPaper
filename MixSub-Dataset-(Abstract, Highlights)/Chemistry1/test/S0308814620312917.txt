 Thermal processing is a traditional method for processing hawthorn into food or medicine . In this study the compositions of free and bound phenolic compounds in raw hawthorn were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and the effect of thermal processing on phenolics and antioxidant activity was determined . Among the phenolics identified in unheated hawthorn 26 were soluble while only 10 were insoluble bound . Thermal processing caused a significant reduction in total soluble phenolics content but an increase in total insoluble bound phenolics

@highlight Free and bound phenolics were identified by UPLC Q TOF MS in hawthorn.
@highlight Thermal processing results in different changes of free and bound phenolics.
@highlight Thermal processing significantly affected antioxidant activities of hawthorn.
@highlight The phenolic with the greatest contribution to antioxidant activity were determined.
