 The progressive SARS CoV2 outbreaks worldwide have evoked global investigation . Despite the numerous An Based on the prediction and analysis we have identified 22 potential miRNAs from five genomes of SARS CoV2 linked with 12 human miRNAs . Analysis of human miRNAs hsa mir 1267 hsa mir 1 3p hsa mir 5683 were found shared between all the five viral SARS CoV2 miRNAs . Further PANTHER classification analyzed the gene ontology being carried by these associations showed that 44 genes were involved in biological functions that includes genes specific for signaling pathway immune complex generation enzyme binding with effective role in the virus host relationship . Our analysis concludes that the genes identified in this study can be effective in analyzing the virus host interaction . It also provides a new direction to understand viral pathogenesis with a probable new way to link that can be used to understand and relate the miRNAs of the virus to the host conditions .

@highlight The rising epidemics of SARS CoV2 has globally made a serious concern.
@highlight Thus understanding the virus host relationship remains a serious concern.
@highlight Here we adopted the in silico approach to picturized the similarities between the miRNAs of SARS CoV2 genomes and human.
@highlight Further the assessments and prediction of miRNAs helped us to analyze and understand the mechanism of pathogenesis.
