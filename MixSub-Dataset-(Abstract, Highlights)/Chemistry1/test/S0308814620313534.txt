 A cascade process for the sequential recovery of proteins and feruloylated arabinoxylan from wheat bran is proposed involving a protein isolation step enzymatic destarching and subcritical water extraction . The protein isolation step combining lactic acid fermentation and cold alkaline extraction reduced the recalcitrance of wheat bran thus improving the total yields of the subsequent subcritical water extraction . The time evolution of subcritical water extraction of feruloylated arabinoxylan was compared at two temperatures . Longer residence times enhanced the purity of target feruloylated arabinoxylans whereas higher temperatures resulted in faster extraction at the expense of significant molar mass reduction . The radical scavenging activity of the extracted feruloylated arabinoxylans was preserved after the initial protein isolation step . This study opens new possibilities for the cascade valorization of wheat bran into enriched protein and non starch polysaccharide fractions which show potential to be used as functional food ingredients .
