 Enzymatic tenderization is extensively applied in the meat industry whereas its influence on meat flavor has seldom been evaluated . Proteinase K papain bromelain and Flavourzyme were used to treat beef muscle and the changes in volatile compounds and odors were subsequently analyzed . Proteolysis by proteinase K was found to elevate the average bitterness of the identified peptides by generating peptides with high Q values whereas proteolysis by papain generated the highest level of amino acids . Enzymatic treatment by Flavourzyme and bromelain significantly elevated the levels of ketones and odors whereas excessive proteolysis by papain and proteinase K largely reduced the levels of esters and aldehydes . The level of amino acids and degree of hydrolysis were found to be predominant factors that regulated the level of volatiles and odors . These results highlighted the huge influence of enzymatic tenderization on meat flavor depending on degree of hydrolysis and cleavage pattern of applied proteases .

@highlight Excessive proteolysis during enzymatic tenderization generated bitter peptides.
@highlight Mild proteolysis by Fla and Bro helped to elevate the levels of volatiles and odors.
@highlight Excessive proteolysis by Pap and Pro K had a negative influence on flavors.
@highlight Liberation of amino acids was the most predominant factor that affects volatiles.
