 Pomegranate seed oil is valuable source of bioactive compounds with health beneficial effects but it is sensitive to oxidation due to high content of PUFA . In order to improve stability of pomegranate seed oil the influence of natural antioxidant and a combination of synthetic antioxidant and pomegranate peel extract was investigated . The oxidation process was followed by monitoring fatty acid composition and measuring the quality and stability parameters of oil during storage for 12days at 65 C. Furthermore total phenolic content and DPPH radical scavenging activity was measured . Pomegranate peel extract as well as a combination of pomegranate peel extract and BHT can have a significant positive impact on improvement of the quality and stability parameters of pomegranate seed oil . Furthermore such activity was better than BHT used alone .

@highlight Pomegranate peel extract PPE was used for the pomegranate seed oil stabilization.
@highlight PPE is a suitable antioxidant for the prevention of pomegranate seed oil oxidation.
@highlight PPE expressed a better effect on pomegranate seed oil stability than BHT.
