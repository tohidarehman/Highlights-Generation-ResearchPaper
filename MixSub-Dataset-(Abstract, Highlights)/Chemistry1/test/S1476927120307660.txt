 Technological progress and the development of laboratory techniques and bioinformatics tools have led to the availability of ever increasing amounts of biological data including genomic proteomic and transcriptomic sequences and related information . These data have helped in understanding some of the complicated life process from a systematic level . Many diseases are generated by abnormalities in multiple regulating processes . In this study we constructed a novel miRNAgenedisease fusion algorithm by integrating three genome wide networks namely microRNA gene function and disease similarity networks . The data fusion method was applied to construct a miRNAgenedisease association network model from these networks to explore miRNAdisease associations mediated by genes with similar functions . mmiRNAs bind to their target genes and regulate their expression so the miRNAgene and genedisease regulatory relationships were included in the network model to more accurately predict miRNAdisease associations . The proposed MGDF was used to predict miRNAcancer associations and the results show that most of the predicted associations had evidence in existing databases .
