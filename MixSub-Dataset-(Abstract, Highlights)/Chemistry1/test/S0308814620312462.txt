 Dairy polar lipids seem to exhibit antiplatelet effects . However it is not known what molecular species may be responsible . In this study we confirmed using C30 reversed phase ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometry that fermentation of yoghurts from ovine milk using specific starter cultures altered the PL composition . These lipid alterations occurred concomitant with increased antithrombotic properties of the yoghurts PL fractions against platelet activating factor and thrombin induced platelet aggregation . Specifically elevation in phosphatidylethanolamine sphingomyelin phosphatidylcholine and their molecular species were observed following yoghurt fermentation . Furthermore PC PE SM and several other molecular species were significantly inversely correlated with the inhibition of PAF and thrombin . These molecular species were abundant in the most bioactive yoghurts fermented by
