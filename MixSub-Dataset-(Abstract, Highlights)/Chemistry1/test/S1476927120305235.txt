 High Mobility Group Box 1 protein is an abundant protein with multiple functions in cells acting as a DNA chaperone and damage associated molecular pattern molecule . It represents an attractive target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancers . The plant natural product glycyrrhizin is a well characterized ligand of HMGB1 and a drug used to treat diverse liver and skin diseases . The drug is known to bind to each of the two adjacent HMG boxes of the non glycosylated protein . In cells HMGB1 is N glycosylated at three asparagine residues located in boxes A and B and these N glycans are essential for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of the protein . But the impact of the N glycans on drug binding is unknown . Here we have investigated the effect of the N glycosylation of HMGB1 on its interaction with GLR using molecular modelling after incorporation of three N glycans on a Human HMGB1 structure . Sialylated bi antennary N glycans were introduced on the protein and exposed in a folded or an extended conformation for the drug binding study . The docking of the drug was performed using both 18 and 18 epimers of GLR and the conformations and potential energy of interaction of the different drug protein complexes were compared . The N glycans do not shield the drug binding sites on boxes A and B but can modulate the drug protein interaction via both direct and indirect effects . The calculations indicate that binding of 18 GLR to the HMG box is generally reduced when the protein is N glycosylated vs. the non glycosylated protein . In particular the N glycans in an extended configuration significantly weaken the binding of GLR to box B . The effects of the N glycans are mostly indirect but in one case a direct contact with the drug via a carbohydrate carbohydrate interaction was observed with 18 GLR bound to Box B of glycosylated HMGB1 . For the first time it is shown that N glycosylation one of the many post translational modifications of HMGB1 can affect drug binding .
