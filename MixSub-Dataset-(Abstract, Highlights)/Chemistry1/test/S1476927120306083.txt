 Human ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase 2 inhibitors such as thiopurine analogs have been reported to inhibit SARS CoV papain like proteases . The PLpro have significant functional implications in the innate immune response during SARS CoV 2 infection and considered an important antiviral target . Both proteases share strikingly similar USP fold with right handed thumbpalmfingers structural scaffold and conserved catalytic triad Cys His Asp Asn . In this urgency situation of COVID 19 outbreak there is a lack of

@highlight SARS CoV 2 papain like protease PLpro and human ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase 2 USP2 share strikingly similar structural scaffold and conserved catalytic triad.
@highlight Inhibition of Jurkat and MOLT 4 cell growth in low micromolar range 10M was achieved by a new human USP2 inhibitor Z93 .
@highlight This is the first account in the on going COVID 19 outbreak where we purposed the identification of SARS CoV 2 PLpro inhibitor with a proof of human USP2 inhibition.
