 Aimed to study the characteristics of prolyl endopeptidase and its possible role in the degradation of collagen we cloned the full length cDNA sequence of PEP from abalone

@highlight A recombinant prolyl endopeptidase from
@highlight  Hdh PEP was prepared.
@highlight The optimum pH and temperature of rHdh PEP was 6 and 20C.
@highlight The crystal structure of rHdh PEP was determined.
@highlight rHdh PEP specifically cleaved collagen peptides at the C terminal of proline residues.
