 Antarctic krill oil is an emerging dietary supplement containing metal ions that influence oil oxidation . Thus this study focuses on the effect and mechanism of metal ions on phospholipid oxidation in AKO . Firstly AKO containing Mg

@highlight Iron ion exhibited the strongest prooxidative ability for Antarctic krill oil.
@highlight Fe
@highlight  SO
@highlight was more effective than ferric oleate in promoting krill oil oxidation.
@highlight Oxidation degree of phosphatidylethanolamine was deeper than phosphatidylcholine.
@highlight Electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance led to difference of oxidation rate.
@highlight Phosphatidylcholine inhibited the oxidation of polyunsaturated triacylglycerol.
