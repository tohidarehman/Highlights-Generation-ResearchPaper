 In this study the reinforced carnauba wax based oleogel with adipic acid was prepared and its potential for application in the cake and the beef burger was evaluated . As a result the addition of AA in CW based oleogels caused to form new intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonding and improve the thermal behavior and crystallinity of oleogels . Additionally the increase of AA concentration higher than 3 of oleogel formulation significantly increased the strength of oleogels . The formulated food models with partial substitution CW2 AA4 oleogel as the optimized sample showed an acceptable texture profile color and organoleptic characteristics . Consequently reinforced oleogel with carnauba wax adipic acid in bakery and meat products can provide considerable promise to develop food products with lower saturated and trans fatty acid .

@highlight An increase in hydrogen bonds was recognized by adipic acid presence in oleogels structure.
@highlight Synergistic effect of carnauba wax and adipic acid improved thermal behavior crystallinity and oil binding capacity.
@highlight Oxidative stability of oleogels containing both carnauba wax and adipic acid was higher than commercial soybean oil during storage time.
@highlight Formulated oleogel can be successfully used in formulation of cake and beef burger as food model.
