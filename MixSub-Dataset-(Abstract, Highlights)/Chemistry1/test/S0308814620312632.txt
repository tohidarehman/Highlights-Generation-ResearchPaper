 Tofu gel was made by using citric acid in combination with varied volumetric ratios of nano fish bone . The gel properties were investigated by colorimetry penetration tests scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy . As the volumetric ratio increased from 0 to 3 the soluble calcium concentrations of soymilk linearly increased from 1.78 to 6.42mg mL . Correspondently yield moisture and texture values of the tofu gel increased continuously while syneresis and whiteness decreased . Furthermore ionic bonds hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds increased by 140 40 and 10 respectively . With the addition of NFB the helices of the soybean proteins changed to sheets and random coil structures . Additionally the tofu gel network became more orderly and denser . The results confirmed that NFB can be utilized as a functional coagulant ingredient to improve the properties of acid induced tofu gels .
