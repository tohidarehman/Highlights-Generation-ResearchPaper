 As a large group of small non coding RNAs Piwi interacting RNAs have been detected to be associated with various diseases . Identifying disease associated piRNAs can provide promising candidate molecular targets to promote the drug design . Although a few computational ensemble methods have been developed for identifying piRNA disease associations the low quality negative associations even with positive associations used during the training process prevent the predictive performance improvement . In this study we proposed a new computational predictor named iPiDA sHN to predict potential piRNA disease associations . iPiDA sHN presented the piRNA disease pairs by incorporating piRNA sequence information the known piRNA disease association network and the disease semantic graph . High level features of piRNA disease associations were extracted by the Convolutional Neural Network . Two step positive unlabeled learning strategy based on Support Vector Machine was employed to select the high quality negative samples from the unknown piRNA disease pairs . Finally the SVM predictor trained with the known piRNA disease associations and the high quality negative associations was used to predict new piRNA disease associations . The experimental results showed that iPiDA sHN achieved superior predictive ability compared with other state of the art predictors .
