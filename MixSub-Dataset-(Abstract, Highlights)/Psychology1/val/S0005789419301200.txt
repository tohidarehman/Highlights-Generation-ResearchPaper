 Given the prominence of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale in treatment outcome studies we conducted a critical examination of its internal consistency and relationship to other measures of irritability in 758 psychiatrically hospitalized youth with autism spectrum disorder . In exploratory and confirmation samples we conducted factor and bifactor analyses to describe the internal structure of the ABC I . Our results suggest that the ABC I roughly represents a unidimensional construct of irritability as indicated by a general factor in bifactor analysis . In addition to irritability subordinate factors are presented that represent tantrums verbal outbursts self harm and negative affect . Notably self harm items explain a large proportion of variance independent of irritability . Therefore their contribution in analyses of treatment effects should be considered . Further study or revision of the ABC I may improve convergent validity with transdiagnostic formulations of irritability as well as prevent confound from self harm in treatment studies for irritability in ASD

@highlight The Aberrant Behavioral Checklist Irritability Subscale is commonly used in clinical trials.
@highlight Irritability is adequately measured by the ABC I with fair reliability.
@highlight It has a complex internal structure with four separable components.
@highlight The self harm component explains a large portion response variance independently of irritability.
