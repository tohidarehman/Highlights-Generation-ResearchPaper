 Our field has come a long way in establishing cognitive behavioral therapy as the empirically supported treatment of choice for a wide range of mental and behavioral health problems . Nevertheless most individuals with mental disorders do not receive any care at all and those who do often have difficulty accessing care that is consistently high in quality . Addressing these issues is complex and costly and thus progress has been slow . We are entering an exciting stage in which emerging technologies might offer novel solutions to the treatment gap . This paper discusses a number of technology enabled solutions to our fields challenges including Internet based and smartphone based cognitive behavioral therapy . Nevertheless we must remain attentive to potential pitfalls of these emerging technologies . The paper incorporates suggestions for how the field may approach these potential pitfalls and provides a vision for how we might develop powerful scalable precisely timed personalized interventions to enhance global mental health .
