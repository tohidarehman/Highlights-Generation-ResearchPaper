 Evidence based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder often produce significant symptom reduction within eight sessions . However some patients take longer to respond and a better understanding of predictors of later response can help guide treatment . In the current study the cohort consisted of all VA patients with a PTSD diagnosis who received at least eight sessions of documented evidence based treatment within a 6 month period in FY16 FY17 and had at least two PTSD symptom assessments . We examined the proportion of patients who achieved meaningful change both within the first eight sessions and subsequently . Fourteen percent of patients achieved meaningful change within eight sessions and 10 subsequently . Symptom change within the first eight sessions was highly predictive of subsequent change . Those who experienced at least 20 symptom reduction by session eight were twice as likely to subsequently achieve meaningful change as compared with all patients who continued treatment . Patients receiving service connected disability compensation were less likely and White patients more likely to achieve meaningful change . Without some degree of symptom reduction by session eight patients are unlikely to achieve meaningful change if treatment is not enhanced or changed .

@highlight 14 of veterans achieved meaningful change within 8 sessions and 10 subsequently
@highlight Those without some symptom reduction by session 8 are at high risk for nonresponse
