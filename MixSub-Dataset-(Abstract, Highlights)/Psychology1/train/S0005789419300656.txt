 Evidence from analogue samples suggests that deficits in emotional functioning namely elevated emotional reactivity and distress intolerance are implicated in the development and maintenance of hoarding disorder . We aimed to extend previous research in this area by investigating emotional reactivity and distress intolerance in a sample of individuals diagnosed with hoarding disorder

@highlight Trait distress intolerance independently predicted greater hoarding severity
@highlight Trait distress intolerance shared a small moderate relationship with task persistence
@highlight Hoarding and clinical groups self reported poorer trait emotional functioning
@highlight Groups did not differ on task induced subjective or physiological reactivity
@highlight The hoarding group self reported more distress prior to task initiation
