 Computerized interpretation bias modification programs show promise for the treatment of anxiety disorders though they have rarely been compared to active treatments . The goal of the present study was to compare the efficacy of IBM to progressive muscle relaxation for the treatment of social anxiety disorder . Sixty four participants with SAD were recruited from across the United States and randomly assigned to 8 internet delivered twice weekly sessions of IBM or PMR . Participants were administered assessments of primary symptom outcomes and interpersonal suicide risk factors at posttreatment and 3 month follow up . IBM led to significantly lower negative interpretation bias than PMR at posttreatment but not follow up . Both conditions experienced comparable reductions in social anxiety from pretreatment to follow up IBM

@highlight We compared interpretation bias modification to progressive muscle relaxation for social anxiety
@highlight Both treatments were delivered online and had very low attrition
@highlight Both treatments were associated with substantial equivalent improvements in social anxiety
