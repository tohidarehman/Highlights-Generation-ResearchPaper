 Cognitive behavioral therapy is an efficacious treatment for child anxiety disorders but 40 50 of youth do not respond fully to treatment and time commitments for standard CBT can be prohibitive for some families and lead to long waiting lists for trained CBT therapists in the community . SmartCAT 2.0 is an adjunctive mobile health program designed to improve and shorten CBT treatment for anxiety disorders in youth by providing them with the opportunity to practice CBT skills outside of session using an interactive and gamified interface . It consists of an app and an integrated clinician portal connected to the app for secure 2 way communication with the therapist . The goal of the present study was to evaluate SmartCAT 2.0 in an open trial to establish usability feasibility acceptability and preliminary efficacy of brief CBT combined with SmartCAT . We also explored changes in CBT skills targeted by the app . Participants were 34 youth who met DSM 5 criteria for generalized separation and or social anxiety disorder . Results demonstrated strong feasibility and usability of the app portal and high satisfaction with the intervention . Youth used the app an average of 12 times between each therapy session
