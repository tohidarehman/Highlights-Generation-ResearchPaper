 Despite the incidence of trauma in the histories of people with Hoarding Disorder reexperiencing symptoms namely intrusive images have not been investigated in the condition . To address this 27 individuals who met DSM 5 criteria for HD and 28 community controls were interviewed about their everyday experiences of intrusive imagery and the unexpected images they experience when discarding high and low value possessions . Compared to CCs everyday images described by the HD group were more frequent had a greater negative valence and were associated with greater interference in everyday life and attempts to avoid the imagery . With regard to discard related imagery a MANOVA followed up with mixed ANOVAs showed that HD participants reported more negative experiences of intrusive imagery in comparison with CCs during recent episodes of discarding objects of low subjective value . However HD and CC participants both experienced positive imagery when discarding high value objects . CC participants reported greater avoidance of imagery in the high value object condition but imagery avoidance did not change between conditions for HD participants . The findings are discussed particularly in relation to the potential of imagery based interventions for HD .

@highlight This is the first study to investigate intrusive imagery in Hoarding Disorder.
@highlight Hoarding individuals report intrusive imagery that impedes discarding.
@highlight Imagery based interventions may prove useful for treating Hoarding Disorder.
