 There is a major public health need for innovative and efficacious behavioral and cognitive interventions for smoking cessation . This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of an acceptance and commitment therapy smartphone application in augmenting ACT group treatment for smoking cessation . One hundred fifty adults smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomly assigned to 6 weekly group sessions of behavioral support ACT or ACT combined with the smartphone application . Access to the app was provided from the start of the in person treatment until the 6 month follow up assessment . Participants were encouraged to make their quit attempts after the third session and the posttreatment assessment occurred 3 weeks later . Measures of smoking status and ACT processes were obtained at baseline posttreatment and 6 month follow up . Biochemically verified quit rates in the combined ACT and behavioral support groups were 36
