 Irritability is a substrate of more than one dozen clinical syndromes . Thus identifying when it is atypical and interfering with functioning is crucial to the prevention of mental disorder in the earliest phase of the clinical sequence . Advances in developmentally based measurement of irritability have enabled differentiation of normative irritable mood and tantrums from indicators of concern beginning in infancy . However developmentally sensitive assessments of irritability related impairment are lacking . We introduce the Early Childhood Irritability Related Impairment Interview which assesses impairment associated with irritable mood and tantrums across contexts . Reliability and validity are established across two independent samples varied by developmental period the Emotional Growth preschool sample EmoGrow
