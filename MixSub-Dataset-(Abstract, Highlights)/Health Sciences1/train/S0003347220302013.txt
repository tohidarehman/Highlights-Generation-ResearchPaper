 Animal signallers are subject to audience effects when they alter communication due to changes in the presence or characteristics of receivers . Studies aimed at understanding audience effects have typically examined effects of conspecific audiences on signaller communication . Less work has focused on heterospecific audiences which present an important avenue of research for species that participate in mixed species groups . Here we experimentally tested mixed species flocks of Carolina chickadees

@highlight Chickadees and titmice called less in larger conspecific flocks.
@highlight In nonrisk chickadees called less in larger heterospecific flocks.
@highlight In nonrisk titmice were unaffected by heterospecific flock size.
@highlight In risk chickadees and titmice called more in larger heterospecific flocks.
@highlight Audience effects likely reflect dominance relationships in mixed species flocks.
