 Optimizing reproductive success is an essential part of evolution for both sexes . Females can optimize mating by avoiding superfluous mating advances and insemination since both take time away from other activities and may incur costs related to sperm receipt . While many separate sexed organisms are known to exhibit mate avoidance much less is known about this for simultaneous hermaphrodites . We addressed this here using a simultaneously hermaphroditic species that can choose to mate in either of the two sex roles during each mating interaction . Recently avoidance behaviours in response to natural matings were observed in the hermaphroditic pond snail

@highlight Reproduction can be optimized by avoiding surplus mating advances and inseminations.
@highlight Being inseminated takes time and can incur costs related to sperm receipt.
@highlight Simultaneous hermaphrodites cope with this while serving both reproductive interests.
@highlight Accessory gland proteins and or sperm are found to induce crawl out and biting.
@highlight Earlier reported avoidance behaviours seem to be used to discourage new sperm donors.
