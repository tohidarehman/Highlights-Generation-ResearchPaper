 Highway horizontal curves provide a smooth transition between two tangent sections of roadways . They allow vehicles to adjust their travel directions gradually . However the geometry changes of the highway sections with H curves often raise safety concerns . In order to deploy effective safety countermeasures a critical task is to understand the risk factors associated with H curves . Existing studies have made efforts to probe the safety issues associated with H curves whereas they were limited to relatively small scale examinations because of the challenges in identifying H curves from large road networks . In addition due to the lack of well archived traffic and roadway information gathering other data associated with the H curves is also difficult . Regarding to these gaps this study aims to leverage open source data to analyze the crash risk of highway sections with H curves . In particular the present study highlights itself from two main aspects a H curve extraction tool was developed to facilitate large scale curve data collection through the analytics of different open source data and a crash modeling framework was developed to quantify H curve crash risk . A case study based on a statewide road network was performed to test the developed crash risk models with the collected curve data . The results show the opportunities of using the developed tool for large scale data collection and analyze the safety impacts of H curve geometric properties elevation change traffic exposure among others . Findings of this study provide insights into the improvement of H curve data collection and safety evaluation .
