 Road accidents are one of the leading causes of death and injuries among adolescents and young adults . Road safety education programs aim to promote safe traffic behavior through information skills training or fear appeals . During the last decade an intervention type using victim testimonials has been developed . These types of programs aim to promote road safety by connecting a personal narrative of choices and consequences to the beliefs and behaviors of the audience . Studies on the effectiveness of this type of road safety programs among youngsters who are not yet drivers are still limited .

@highlight We examined the effect of a school based road safety educational program using testimonials for lower secondary school.
@highlight Only a small effect on knowledge on risk factors in traffic was found.
@highlight No effect was found on overall cycling behavior and seat belt use.
@highlight Gender parental educational background and risky cycling behavior did not modify the effect on behavior.
