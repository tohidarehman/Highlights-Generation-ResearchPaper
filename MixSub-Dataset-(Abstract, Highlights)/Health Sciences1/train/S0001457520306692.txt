 A significant portion of pedestrian accidents occurs in the outskirts areas due to the high vehicle speed and lack of safety facilities for pedestrians . Behavioral study on drivers and pedestrians is the key to better understand the causes of pedestrian accidents in order to develop safety models .

@highlight The present study focuses on evaluating the safety of pedestrian crossing in urban and outskirt areas based on fixed videography FV and in motion videography IMV to determine the differences of drivers and pedestrians behaviors in these areas.
@highlight The logistic and linear regression models based on both approaches showed that pedestrians exhibited relatively similar behavior in both areas.
@highlight Pedestrian gender pedestrian willingness to cross without waiting on the side of the roads the tendency of pedestrians to move in groups and the time required to cross the road were influential factors on pedestrian crossing behaviors.
@highlight The distance between the vehicle and the pedestrian as well as the speed of the approaching vehicle were significant factors in choosing an accepted gap by pedestrian.
