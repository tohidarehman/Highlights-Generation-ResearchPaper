 The segmentation of the mitral valve annulus and leaflets specifies a crucial first step to establish a machine learning pipeline that can support physicians in performing multiple tasks e.g . diagnosis of mitral valve diseases surgical planning and intraoperative procedures . Current methods for mitral valve segmentation on 2D echocardiography videos require extensive interaction with annotators and perform poorly on low quality and noisy videos . We propose an automated and unsupervised method for the mitral valve segmentation based on a low dimensional embedding of the echocardiography videos using neural network collaborative filtering . The method is evaluated in a collection of echocardiography videos of patients with a variety of mitral valve diseases and additionally on an independent test cohort . It outperforms state of the art

@highlight Unsupervised segmentation can perform adequately on echocardiography exploiting the low dimensional structure of the video.
@highlight Non linear models i.e. neural collaborative filtering outperform their linear counterparts by exploiting the high adaptivity of the model.
@highlight Our method outperforms supervised methods on low quality videos and defines a new state of the art method for unsupervised mitral valve segmentation.
