 To determine the correlation between meaning and joy in work among managers with employee engagement . The Institute of Healthcare Improvement and the National Patient Safety Foundation both recognize the link between joy and meaning in work and an optimally performing healthcare system . The relationship between manager joy and employee engagement is unknown . Furthermore the Meaning and Joy in Work Questionnaire has not been previously used with nurse managers . A descriptive correlational design was used with results from a prospective survey of nurse managers correlated with pre existing employee engagement quality data . Chronbach s alpha was used to measure internal consistency of the tool in this population . No significant correlation was found between nurse manager meaning and joy in work and employee engagement or employee perception of their manager . A significant strong correlation between employee engagement scores and employee perception of their managers was identified . While we did not find significant correlation between manager meaning and joy in work with employee engagement the MJWQ may be a valuable tool to explore nurse manager s meaning and joy in work and the potential relationship of this construct to employee engagement and associated outcomes . The expansion of the sample size across multiple healthcare systems may lead to different results .

@highlight The MJWQ Tool is a valuable tool to explore nurse managers meaning and joy in work.
@highlight The sample size used for this study was underpowered.
@highlight Recommendation was made for future studies with an expanded sample size.
@highlight Studies to evaluate correlation of employee engagement with manager perception should be explored.
