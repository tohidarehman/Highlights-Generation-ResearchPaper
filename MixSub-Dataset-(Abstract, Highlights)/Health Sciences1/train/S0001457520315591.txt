 Driving a vehicle requires individuals awareness of their surroundings to prevent collisions with other vehicles objects and pedestrians . While previous research has investigated time to arrival in real world and simulated driving situations there is little information on how pedestrian reflectance and time of day impact TTA . The present study investigated how vehicle velocity viewing time pedestrian reflectance and time of day affected individuals estimates of TTA . We used recorded driver perspective footage of a vehicle approaching simulated pedestrians at different velocities during daytime and nighttime . We found that TTA was consistently underestimated with the most accurate TTA estimates occurring at the lowest vehicle velocity . We also found TTA accuracy was better during daytime conditions . Pedestrian reflectance did not produce a significant main effect but it did interact significantly with both velocity and time of day . These results suggest that multiple variables are responsible for TTA estimation . A better understanding of what factors may affect TTA estimates helps both researchers who investigate the phenomenon and laypersons who strive for safe driving practices .

@highlight Time of day vehicle velocity pedestrian reflectance and viewing time all interacted to influence TTA estimates.
@highlight On average TTA was underestimated at all vehicle velocities.
@highlight TTA estimates were most accurate at the lowest vehicle velocity.
@highlight TTA was more underestimated in nighttime conditions compared to daytime conditions.
