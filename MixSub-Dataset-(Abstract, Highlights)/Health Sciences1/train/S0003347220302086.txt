 Understanding the determinants of fighting ability is key to elucidating the evolution of aggressive behaviour as current tests of contest theory rely on realistic proxies for overall RHP . Traditionally RHP is considered equivalent to body size but it is increasingly clear that a wider range of morphological and physiological traits contribute to fighting ability . In situations analogous to contests such as courtship displays in animals and competitive sport in humans the role of skill has long been appreciated but this component has been neglected in analyses of animal fights . Here we investigated two spatial components of skill accuracy and precision during shell fights in hermit crabs where an attacker repeatedly strikes its shell against that of a defender . By analysing the points of impact of these strikes we found that attackers that rapped with coarse scale accuracy were more likely to win the fight indicating that the ability to target a sweet spot on the defender s shell is an important determinant of contest success . Furthermore we found that this element of skill correlated with temporal performance . Taken together these results show that spatial skill is an RHP component . Moreover in contrast to the traditional assumption that fighting ability is equivalent to body size RHP is actually underpinned by a suite of interlinked traits including performance capacities morphology and skill .

@highlight Fighting often involves the repeated performance of agonistic behaviours.
@highlight Individuals may vary in how skilfully they perform such behaviours.
@highlight We investigate the link between spatial skill and fighting success in hermit crabs.
@highlight We find that winners perform rapping behaviour more skilfully than losers.
@highlight Our results indicate that skill is tightly correlated with other fighting traits.
