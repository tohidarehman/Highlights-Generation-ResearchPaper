 Individuals sometimes exhibit striking constancy to a single behaviour even when they are capable of short term behavioural flexibility . Constancy enables animals to avoid costs such as memory constraints but can also inflict significant opportunity costs through behaviourenvironment mismatch . It is unclear when individuals should exhibit behavioural constancy and which types of costs most strongly influence such behaviour . We use a case in which individuals within a population exhibit more than one handling tactic for a single food type to investigate whether costs associated with switching among tactics constrain expression of intra individual variation . Using wild bumble bees

@highlight We examined factors influencing constancy of foraging tactics in bumble bees.
@highlight Bees forage via floral openings legitimate or via holes at the flower base rob .
@highlight Bee foraging was highly constant feeding legitimately or robbing nectar.
@highlight Bees readily switched tactics and there was no cost to switching.
