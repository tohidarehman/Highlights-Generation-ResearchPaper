 Niche partitioning among different age breeding status or sex classes allows resource use to be maximized while reducing intraspecific competition . Individual specialization marks the finest scale of niche partitioning where within a species individuals differ in their realized niches . Despite having important implications in ecology evolution and conservation studies simultaneously addressing the occurrence of both phenomena are scarce . We studied niche partitioning and individual specialization in foraging behaviour in relation to age breeding status and sex using breeding nonbreeding adult and immature Scopoli s shearwaters

@highlight Immature long lived seabirds at 36 years old can be as specialized as adults.
@highlight Males have more individually specialized foraging movements than females.
@highlight A greater isotopic variability in males suggests they consume more discards.
@highlight Human derived resources can drive sexual differences in foraging strategy.
