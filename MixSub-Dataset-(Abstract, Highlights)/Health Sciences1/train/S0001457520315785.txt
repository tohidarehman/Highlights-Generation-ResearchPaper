 This study aimed to determine the risk factors associated with unsafe events involving a motor vehicle that occurred while group riding in Perth Western Australia . Naturalistic video footage was collected from 52 group riders and unsafe events identified . A case crossover study was used to compare the road infrastructure and group behavioural characteristics of 108 case sites where unsafe events occurred to 216 control sites where no unsafe events occurred . After controlling for potential confounding factors roundabouts increased the risk of an unsafe event compared to midblocks 3.63 95 confidence interval 1.578.42

@highlight A naturalistic study examined risk factors for unsafe events while group riding.
@highlight Roundabouts increased the risk of an unsafe event involving a motor vehicle.
@highlight Traffic islands speed limits 60 km h and rider violations also increased risk.
@highlight Riding 2 abreast in a traffic lane or with all riders in a bike lane decreased risk.
@highlight Road infrastructure treatments and education could promote safety for group riders.
