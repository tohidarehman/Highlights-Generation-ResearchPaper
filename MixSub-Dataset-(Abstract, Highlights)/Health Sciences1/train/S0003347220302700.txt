 The observable diversity of antipredator defences across organisms demonstrates predation s impact on trait evolution . The functions of many traits that are presumed to have an antipredator function have never been directly tested . The spiny orb weaving spider

@highlight We tested whether
@highlight uses stridulation in antipredator defence.
@highlight We quantified behavioural and acoustical properties of stridulation.
@highlight We tested survival of silenced and control adult females in the laboratory field.
@highlight Survival of silenced and control females did not differ.
@highlight Stridulation may not serve an antipredator function in
