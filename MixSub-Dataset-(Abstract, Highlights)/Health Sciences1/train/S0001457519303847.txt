 The present research demonstrates the use of advanced trajectory based data to analyze road user interactions at an un signalized intersection under heterogeneous traffic complexities . This study demonstrates an improvement over the conventional grid based analysis to estimate surrogate safety measures . An advanced pattern based approach to categorize pedestrian vehicle interactions based on the road user behavior is proposed in the study . A concept of a two interaction pattern has been applied which deals with the responsive and non responsive behavior of the road users respectively . The behavior based patterns were categorized based on the SSM like Speed Time to Collision and Gap Time profiles of the pedestrian and vehicle interacting on an un signalized intersection . On conducting a variable importance test i.e . k fold test it was comprehended that for pattern 1 Time to collision and for pattern 2 both TTC and Post Encroachment Time were showing required importance . Further Import Vector Machine approach was used to classify the severity levels based on selected indicators computed from 1486 events occurring at three Un Signalized intersections in India . The proposed severity levels will help to test and evaluate various infrastructure and control improvements for making urban intersections safe for road users . It was observed from the severity levels of both the patterns that events involving non evasive behavior can also result in critical interaction . Overall the research provides an advanced framework for evaluating and improving the safety of the uncontrolled intersections .
