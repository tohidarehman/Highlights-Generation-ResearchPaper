 The purpose of this paper is to present the conceptual framework that was used to guide a study on the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus . The Stress and Coping Framework for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was developed in response to a review of the literature that suggests psychological stress or simply distress can contribute toward the development of T2DM with the established risk factors of genetic risk for diabetes obesity and advancing age . The literature shows that distress can influence insulin sensitivity and contribute to the development of T2DM however much of the literature fails to acknowledge the influence of distress in collaboration with GRD obesity and advancing age . As part of creating the current framework an earlier version of the conceptual framework was used for a pilot study . An integrative review was conducted to examine the relationships among GRD obesity advancing age distress and coping to further refine the conceptual framework . Theoretical and empirical studies were examined to define distress describe the nature and impact of the stress response and determine how distress interacts with GRD obesity and advancing age . The literature was used to create a conceptual framework and model consisting of the interactions among the variables . The Stress and Coping Framework for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus shows how distress can contribute to the development of T2DM by interacting directly with established risk factors and in promoting insulin resistance .
