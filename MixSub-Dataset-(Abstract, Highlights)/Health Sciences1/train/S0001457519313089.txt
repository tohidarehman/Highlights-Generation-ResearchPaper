 Employee safety citizenship behavior is critical for workplace safety in a high risk work environment but few studies have addressed how safety stressors affect SCB . This study investigates the different relationships between safety stressors and two forms of SCB . It also examines the moderating effect of safety specific trust within these relationships . An analysis of 332 multisource data from frontline workers and their safety supervisors in China reveals that safety role ambiguity and safety role conflict negatively affect proactive safety behaviors while interpersonal safety conflict impedes prosocial safety behaviors . Additionally cognition based safety trust alleviates the effects of safety role ambiguity and safety role conflict on proactive safety behaviors whereas affect based safety trust effectively restricts the influence of interpersonal safety conflict on prosocial safety behaviors . These results suggest that managers need to instill SCB in their subordinates and combat stressful conditions through interventions that enhance safety specific trust .
