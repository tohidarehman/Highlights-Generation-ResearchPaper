 Computer vision systems have numerous tools to assist in various medical fields notably in image diagnosis . Computed tomography is the principal imaging method used to assist in the diagnosis of diseases such as bone fractures lung cancer heart disease and emphysema among others . Lung cancer is one of the four main causes of death in the world . The lung regions in the CT images are marked manually by a specialist as this initial step is a significant challenge for computer vision techniques . Once defined the lung regions are segmented for clinical diagnoses . This work proposes an automatic segmentation of the lungs in CT images using the Convolutional Neural Network Mask R CNN to specialize the model for lung region mapping combined with supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods K means and Gaussian Mixture Models . Our approach using Mask R CNN with the K means kernel produced the best results for lung segmentation reaching an accuracy of 97.683.42 and an average runtime of 11.2s . We compared our results against other works for validation purposes and our approach had the highest accuracy and was faster than some state of the art methods .

@highlight This study presents a new approach for automatic segmentation of lung CT scans.
@highlight An original method for image processing using CNNs as kernels.
@highlight It comprehends a new model based on deep learning using Mask R CNN combined with supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods.
@highlight Our model achieved high quality segmentation results that are better than the results generated by using the standard Mask R CNN itself.
