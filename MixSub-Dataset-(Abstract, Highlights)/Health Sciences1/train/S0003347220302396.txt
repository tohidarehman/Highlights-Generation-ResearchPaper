 Anthropogenic noise is globally increasing in aquatic ecosystems and causes adverse repercussions in many fish species yet its effect on freshwater fish is not well understood . Here we test the impact of boat noise on foraging and swimming behaviour on a number of wild freshwater fish species as well as captive black bullhead

@highlight We assessed the impacts of boat noise on fish in the laboratory and in the wild.
@highlight Boat noise caused captive bullheads to forage less and increase erratic behaviour.
@highlight Responses of wild fish were comparable to those of fish tested in the laboratory.
@highlight Fish with specialized hearing structures had greater responses to boat noise.
@highlight Acoustic tank experiments may show more natural behaviours than previously thought.
