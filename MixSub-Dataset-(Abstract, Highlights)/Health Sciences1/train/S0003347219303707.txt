 The experience of traumatic events can catalyse physiological trade offs that increase the vulnerability of organisms to disease and death . Among potential sources of trauma the arrival of new males in female philopatric species may be particularly salient due to the accompanying threat of infanticide . In such social systems the killing of dependent offspring benefits these new males by accelerating females return to receptivity . Despite widespread interest in the evolutionary drivers of infanticide there is little known about the collateral effects of male immigration on other group members . That is do the periods following male immigration act as windows of adversity that carry costs for group members over and above the direct victims of infanticide Here we examined how the immediate aftermath of new male immigration in a female philopatric species

@highlight Injury risk increased for all group members following male immigration in geladas.
@highlight Dependent infants and lactating females incurred the most injuries.
@highlight Injured females had longer interbirth intervals.
@highlight Our results reveal a link between male immigration and female reproductive fitness.
