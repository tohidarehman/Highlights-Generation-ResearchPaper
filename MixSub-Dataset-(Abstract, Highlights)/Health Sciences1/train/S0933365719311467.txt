 The automatic extraction of a patients natural history from Electronic Health Records is a critical step towards building intelligent systems that can reason about clinical variables and support decision making . Although EHRs contain a large amount of valuable information about the patients medical care this information can only be fully understood when analyzed in a temporal context . Any intelligent system should then be able to extract medical concepts date expressions temporal relations and the temporal ordering of medical events from the free texts of EHRs yet this task is hard to tackle due to the domain specific nature of EHRs writing quality and lack of structure of these texts and more generally the presence of redundant information . In this paper we introduce a new Natural Language Processing framework capable of extracting the aforementioned elements from EHRs written in Spanish using rule based methods . We focus on building medical timelines which include disease diagnosis and its progression over time . By using a large dataset of EHRs comprising information about patients suffering from lung cancer we show that our framework has an adequate level of performance by correctly building the timeline for 843 patients from a pool of 989 patients achieving a precision of 0.852 .

@highlight Our NLP framework obtained a correct result in 85 of instances for building the patients medical timeline from Spanish EHRs.
@highlight Our rule based annotators have shown adequate performance for recognizing lung cancer stage grouping and TNM codes from Spanish clinical texts.
@highlight Our rule based Temporal Tagger outperformed SUTime and HeidelTime for annotation of date expressions written in Spanish clinical texts.
@highlight Our Temporal Reasoning System outperformed TIPSem in linking events to time expressions at sentence level.
