 Like birds and many other animals bats produce diverse acoustic calls for social communication . Geographical variation in social acoustic signals and perceptual discrimination abilities are well studied in birds but largely unexplored in bats . In this study we recorded male territorial calls of the great Himalayan leaf nosed bat

@highlight We examined geographical variation in male Himalayan leaf nosed bat calls.
@highlight Male calls showed significant geographical variation across colonies.
@highlight Neither ecological nor morphological factors nor drift explained the call variation.
@highlight Males can discriminate between calls of their own colony and those of a foreign colony.
