 Males sometimes engage in fights over contested resources such as access to mates in this case fighting behaviour may be adjusted based on the value they place on the females . Resource value can have two components . First males can assess the quality of females which constitutes an objective assessment of RV . Second internal state such as previous mating experience can also influence motivation to fight thus constituting a subjective assessment of RV . If mating opportunities are scarce and available females have a major impact on the lifetime reproductive success of males then fighting can be fatal in this situation it is uncertain whether males would adjust fighting behaviour based on RV . We found that both female quality that is virginity and male mating status influenced fighting intensity between males of the entomopathogenic nematode

@highlight Male entomopathogenic nematodes frequently fight to death for access to mates.
