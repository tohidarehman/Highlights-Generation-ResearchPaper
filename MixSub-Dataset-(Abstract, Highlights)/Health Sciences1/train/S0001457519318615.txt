 Pedestrian road crossing strategy is one of the most important pedestrian road crossing behaviors . The safety of the pedestrians often depends on it . Among the road crossing strategies rolling gap crossing strategy is the riskiest one . The objective of this research was to explore the factors that influenced pedestrians decision to cross the road by rolling gap crossing at intersection . Data regarding road crossing strategy of the pedestrians their characteristics their road crossing behavior intersection geometry and traffic environmental condition were collected through videography survey method on site observation and secondary source from six intersections of Dhaka Bangladesh . A binary logistic regression model was developed in this study by using the collected data . Results of the developed model showed that seven statistically significant factors strongly influenced pedestrians decision to cross the road by rolling gap crossing at intersections . These factors were intersection control type median width vehicle flow available gap on the road age group of the pedestrians their crossing group size and their behavior of crosswalk usage . The results of this study would help the policymakers to take proper interventions to alleviate pedestrian safety problems .

@highlight This study focused on pedestrians decision making process regarding pedestrian road crossing strategy.
@highlight This study identified factors that pushed pedestrians to cross the road by risky rolling gap crossing strategy at intersection.
@highlight A binary logistic regression model was developed to identify significant contributing factors.
@highlight Significant factors were intersection control type median width vehicle flow available gap on the road age group of the pedestrians their crossing group size and their behavior of crosswalk usage.
