 Understanding the patterns and processes related to sexual dimorphism and sex differences in diverse animal taxa is a foundational research topic in ecology and evolution . Within the realm of animal communication studies have traditionally focused on male signals assuming that female choice and malemale competition have promoted sex differences via elaboration of male traits but selection on females also has the potential to drive divergence . Here we describe female song in barn swallows

@highlight We describe and quantify female song in barn swallows for the first time.
@highlight Females sang about 10 times less than males and only early in the breeding season.
@highlight Song traits showed greater sex differences than visual plumage traits.
@highlight Sexual differentiation was correlated with female but not male reproductive success.
