 It has been suggested that Variable Message Signs become less effective at communicating important traffic information when irrelevant information is also displayed on them . The purpose of this study was to examine if practice reading irrelevant information on a VMS influenced compliance with and memory for a detour message . Thirty nine participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups who drove a simulated road one receiving only a detour message on the VMS one group received irrelevant VMS messages before the detour message and a third group received the same messages but the detour message was inconsistent with their destination . Of interest were both the participants compliance with the target detour message as well as their later recall and recognition of the message . The results suggested that first and foremost there was significantly lower compliance with the detour message when it had been preceded by irrelevant messages on the VMS . All of the groups showed reasonably good memory for the detour message . The implications of the present study are that presentation of irrelevant messages including advertisements and safety slogans may result in reduced compliance to traffic relevant messages on VMSs .

@highlight We asked if irrelevant VMS messages diminish the effectiveness of relevant ones.
@highlight Previous research suggested that irrelevant messages do not.
@highlight Our findings indicated that they result in lower compliance with relevant messages.
