 Anger is a common behaviour exhibited by road users when ones goals are perceived to have been blocked by another . Recent research has demonstrated that generally cyclists tend to deal with anger in constructive ways . However when anger does manifest it can result in behaviours that increase their crash risk . Amongst motor vehicle drivers mindfulness levels have been associated with less anger and appear to mediate anger and associated aggression . The current study sought to understand whether mindfulness has similar associations with anger and aggression in a sample of cyclists . A total of 583 cyclists completed an online questionnaire that sought information on their levels of mindfulness current mindfulness practices and tendencies for anger and aggression while cycling . The relationships between these were then examined using structural equation modelling . The results showed that cyclists with higher mindfulness levels tended to report less anger across a range of situations . Both direct and indirect relationships were found between mindfulness and aggression again showing that more mindful cyclists tended to engage in less frequent aggression . These findings align with recent research investigating this relationship amongst motor vehicle drivers and suggest that mindfulness may be a promising strategy to reduce or avoid anger and aggression in cyclists .
