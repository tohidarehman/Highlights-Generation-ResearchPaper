 The idea that animals gain a higher food intake rate when foraging in larger groups has been reported in many studies . However some studies suggested that the number of neighbours under surveillance may play a more important role in affecting food intake rate than flock size . In addition the effect of the number of neighbours should also depend on the position of an individual within a flock . To test these hypotheses we examined the effects of flock size number of neighbours and position within a flock on foraging time foraging efficiency and intake rate of wintering greater white fronted geese

@highlight More neighbours lead to decreased foraging time and foraging efficiency.
@highlight Cryptic competition among neighbours reduces individuals intake rate.
@highlight Number of neighbours is more important in affecting intake rate than flock size.
