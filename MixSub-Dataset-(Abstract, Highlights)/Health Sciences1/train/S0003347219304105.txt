 Anthropogenic noise pollution is known to alter the behaviour of acoustically sensitive animals . Many animals also sense vibrations through solid substrates and use substrate borne vibrations in conspecific communication . The effects of substrate borne noise pollution however remain largely unknown . Here we investigate the potential for seismic noise to alter the reproductive behaviour of the burying beetle

@highlight Seismic noise presents a novel challenge to vibrationally sensitive animals.
@highlight beetles stridulate during parental care and may sense vibrations.
@highlight We measured responses to seismic noise in
@highlight Beetles stridulated throughout burial and sensed low frequency vibrations.
@highlight Beetles showed reduced reproductive output in the presence of seismic noise.
