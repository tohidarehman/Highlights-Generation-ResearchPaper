 Prey detection and selection by birds can be influenced by prey coloration . Whereas certain colours can indicate to predators the unpalatability of prey other colours can render prey cryptic against the background . However there are discrepancies in the response of birds to prey coloration reported in different studies . Such discrepancies can be the result of geographical or temporal differences between studies if birds in different regions respond differently to coloration or if responses vary seasonally due to changes in bird composition . Experimental studies aiming to understand bird responses to prey colour should consider the effect of geographical variation while accounting for seasonal as well as interannual variability . We investigated the effects of colour on attack rates by exposing plasticine caterpillars of different colours to bird communities in 13 Mediterranean forests in central Spain for a period from 17 weeks to 7 months . Overall yellow and green dummy caterpillars suffered the lowest attack rates . We also observed a bimodal pattern of bird attack rates through time with highest predation occurring in late winter and summer . Low attack rates on yellow dummies are probably a consequence of aposematism while low attack rates on green dummies probably resulted from crypsis . Rapid decreases in attack rates over time are probably a result of avoidance learning whereas the increase in attacks in summer could be explained by the increase in fledglings and migrant birds .

@highlight Yellow dummy caterpillars received fewer bird attacks probably due to aposematism.
@highlight Green caterpillars received fewer bird attacks probably due to reduced detectability.
@highlight Birds predominantly attacked caterpillars with dark colours.
@highlight The effect of dummy prey colour on bird predation was consistent across sites.
@highlight Predation rate varied over time with maximum rates in the warmest months.
