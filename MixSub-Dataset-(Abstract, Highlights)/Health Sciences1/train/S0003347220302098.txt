 Acclimation conditions may affect the fighting ability of individuals involved in agonistic contests through their oxidative status . For instance exposure to high temperatures might increase the metabolic rate of opponents and their production of damaging reactive oxygen species . Animals investing more strongly in antioxidant defences to minimize the damaging action of heat induced ROS may therefore be deprived of antioxidant defences and hence less able to sustain fight effort during subsequent contests . Here we examined the interplay between acclimation temperature oxidative status and fight outcome in male field crickets

@highlight Oxidative status may mediate the effects of thermal conditions on fight outcome.
@highlight In crickets males with higher antioxidant defences were more likely to win fights.
@highlight This advantage only occurred between opponents acclimated to the same temperature.
@highlight Hence antioxidant defences contribute to resource holding potential of opponents.
@highlight Yet they do not mediate the effects of temperature on fight outcome.
