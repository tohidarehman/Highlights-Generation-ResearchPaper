 Using information from multiple predation cues may allow prey to accurately assess predation risk and correlate antipredator responses with the intensity of the threat . We assessed whether combined unimodal cues would enhance antipredator behaviour in captivity by presenting 10 wild caught ship rats

@highlight Amalgamating information from two unimodal predation cues can inform prey behaviour.
@highlight Direct and indirect predation cues may interact to amplify defensive behaviour.
@highlight Presenting combinations of predation cues may enhance pest management strategies.
