 Animals often exhibit extensive flexibility in movement behaviours on a range of temporal and spatial scales in response to cues that reliably predict fitness outcomes . The annual timing of movements between distinct habitats can be crucial particularly in seasonal environments with narrow ecological windows of opportunity . In polygamous species sexual selection may further shape sex specific phenology and movement behaviours . Here we characterized seasonal daily and diel movement patterns in adult brown trout

@highlight Brown trout males move from feeding lakes to spawning streams before females.
@highlight While length of activity period is similar males conduct more frequent movements.
@highlight Transitional movements of both sexes are primarily nocturnal.
@highlight Movement probability increases as river height increases and the moon wanes.
