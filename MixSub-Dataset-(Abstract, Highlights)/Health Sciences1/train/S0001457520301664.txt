 A penalty mechanism is usually considered as a powerful means to reduce the probability of traffic violations and accidents by encouraging drivers to comply with traffic regulations . Penalty point and fine strategies are often used in parallel . Different degrees of penalty points and or fines are imposed according to the specific violation behavior of drivers . However the question of whether each penalty produces positive effects in maintaining a drivers compliance with traffic regulations and promoting the drivers traffic safety is still unanswered . This study focuses on quantifying the effects of penalty point and fine strategies on violation recurrences and accident occurrences of drivers . A frailty survival analysis method is conducted to jointly model the occurrence of violation and accident events of each individual . The frailty term in the model is leveraged to address the unobserved heterogeneity among drivers . Personal characteristics and penalty status are also incorporated as covariates in the model . Actual violation and accident data from a province in China are utilized to calibrate the model . The results show that penalty point strategy exhibits deterrent and binding effects however penalty fine strategy does not show the expected effects . The number of years of driving is also a significant factor that influences violation recurrence and accident occurrence . The present study provides insightful information for improving violation penalty mechanisms .
