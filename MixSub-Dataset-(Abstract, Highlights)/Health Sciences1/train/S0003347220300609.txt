 Recent improvements in tracking technologies have resulted in a growing number of fine scale animal movement studies in a variety of fields from wildlife management to animal cognition . Most studies assume that an animal s optimal foraging route is linear ignoring the role the energy landscape can play in influencing movement efficiency . Our objective was to investigate whether landscape features that affect movement costs influence the movement of chimpanzees

@highlight We studied landscape drivers of chimpanzee ranging in a rugged montane environment.
@highlight Chimpanzees used a network of repeatedly used routes across their range.
@highlight Chimpanzees preferentially used human made trails but not ridges for travel.
@highlight Route reuse has implications for chimpanzee energetics sociality and cognition.
