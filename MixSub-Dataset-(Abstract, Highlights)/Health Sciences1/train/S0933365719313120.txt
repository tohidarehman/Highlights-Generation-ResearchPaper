 Automated detection of dynamical change in EEG signals has been a long standing problem in a wide range of clinic applications . It is essential to extract an effective and accurate EEG rhythm indicator that can reflect the dynamical behavior of a given EEG signal . Time frequency analysis is a promising method to achieve this end but existing methods still have limitations in real implementation making this kind of methods still progressive until the present day . In this paper along the line of ongoing research on time frequency methods we present a new method based on graph based modeling . By virtue of this method an effective and accurate EEG rhythm indicator can be extracted to characterize the dynamical EEG time series . Together with the extracted EEG rhythm indicator an automatic analysis of continuous monitoring of EEG signal is developed by means of a null hypothesis testing to inspect whether an EEG change occurs or not during a monitoring period . The proposed framework is applied to both simulated data and real signals respectively to validate its effectiveness . Experimental results together with theoretical interpretation and discussions suggest its promising potentials in practice .
