 Early detection of skin cancer is very important and can prevent some skin cancers such as focal cell carcinoma and melanoma . Although there are several reasons that have bad impacts on the detection precision . Recently the utilization of image processing and machine vision in medical applications is increasing . In this paper a new image processing based method has been proposed for the early detection of skin cancer . The method utilizes an optimal Convolutional neural network for this purpose . In this paper improved whale optimization algorithm is utilized for optimizing the CNN . For evaluation of the proposed method it is compared with some different methods on two different datasets . Simulation results show that the proposed method has superiority toward the other compared methods .
