 Carrion is a patchy nutrient rich and frequently bulky resource that hosts a complex community of competing organisms . Several insect species have specialized to use carrion for breeding revealing a specific suite of behavioural adaptations . Larvae of carrion insects regularly aggregate while feeding frequently forming spectacular larval masses . Here we analysed patterns and mechanisms of collective feeding by larvae of the communally breeding carrion beetle

@highlight Larval aggregates of carrion beetle
@highlight are prevalent on large carcasses.
@highlight While aggregating larvae consistently respond to heat in the environment.
@highlight Ground deposited chemical cues are less important for this aggregation.
@highlight Heat and food are key larval aggregation mechanisms in this species.
