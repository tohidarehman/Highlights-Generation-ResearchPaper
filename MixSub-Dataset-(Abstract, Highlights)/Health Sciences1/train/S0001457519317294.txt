 This paper introduces a framework for modelling the cyclists comfort zone . Unlike the drivers comfort zone little is known about the cyclists . The framework draws on existing literature in cognitive science about driver behaviour to explain experimental results from cycling field trials and the modelling of these results . We modelled braking and steering manoeuvres from field data of cyclists obstacle avoidance within their comfort zone . Results show that when cyclists avoided obstacles by braking they kept a constant deceleration as speed increased they started to brake earlier farther from the obstacle maintaining an almost constant time to collision . When cyclists avoided obstacles by steering they maintained a constant distance from the object independent of speed . Overall the higher the speed the more the steering manoeuvres were temporally delayed compared to braking manoeuvres . We discuss these results and other similarities between cyclist and driver behaviour during obstacle avoidance . Implications for the design of acceptable active safety and infrastructure design are also addressed .

@highlight We modelled cyclist comfortable braking and steering using field experimental data.
@highlight Cyclists braked with constant deceleration and steered at constant distance.
@highlight The higher the speed the more steering came after braking.
@highlight We exemplify how the models can inform active safety and infrastructure design.
