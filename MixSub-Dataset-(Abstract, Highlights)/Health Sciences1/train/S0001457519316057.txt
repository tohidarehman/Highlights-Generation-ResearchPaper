 Most previous studies investigate the safety effects of a single speed camera ignoring the potential impacts from adjacent speed cameras . The mutual influence between two or even more adjacent speed cameras is a relevant attribute worth taking into account when evaluating the safety impacts of speed cameras . This paper investigates the safety effects of two or more speed cameras observed within a specific radius which are defined as multiple speed cameras . A total of 464 speed cameras at treated sites and 3119 control sites are observed and related to road traffic accident data from 1999 to 2007 . The effects of multiple speed cameras are evaluated using pairwise comparisons between treatment units with different doses based on the propensity score methods . The spatial effect of multiple speed cameras is investigated by testing various radii . There are two major findings in this study . First sites with multiple speed cameras perform better in reducing the absolute number of road accidents than those with a single camera . Second speed camera sites are found to be most effective with a radius of 200m . For a radius of 200m and 300m the reduction in the personal injury collisions by multiple speed cameras are 21.4 and 13.2 more than a single camera . Our results also suggest that multiple speed cameras are effective within a small radius .
