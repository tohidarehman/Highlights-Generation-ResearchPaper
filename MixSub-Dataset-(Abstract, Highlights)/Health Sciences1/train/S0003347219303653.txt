 Laterality is the prevalence of one side of the body to perform motor acts and perceptual functions . The evolution of directional biases that are consistent across individuals of a group may have been constrained by the opportunity for asymmetric animals to interact with other asymmetric animals . If we assume that social animals have more opportunity to interact with each other than solitary animals we could expect that the more social animals are the more lateralized and the more aligned they are . In precocial birds the mother is the first and most important social partner and she has a strong influence on her offspring s social motivation . We therefore wondered whether she could also influence its laterality . To see whether mothering influences the chick s laterality we compared behaviours of nonbrooded and brooded domestic chicks

@highlight Nonbrooded chicks are more lateralized and more aligned than brooded chicks.
@highlight Nonbrooded chicks are more social and less emotional than brooded chicks.
@highlight Cohesion and behavioural synchronization correlate with laterality strength.
@highlight A multidimensional analysis shows a direct link between sociality and laterality.
@highlight The more social chicks are the more lateralized they are.
