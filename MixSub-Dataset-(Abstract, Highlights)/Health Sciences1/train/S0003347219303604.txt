 Signals of resource holding potential in dyadic contests are relatively straightforward typically reflected in the attributes of the individual including body size and resource ownership . However conveying this information is considerably more complex in social species the outcome of collective contests will be influenced by both individual and group level effects and the signal must be subsequently transmitted to the colony in order to elicit a colony response . Australian meat ants engage in collective displays where aggregations of many hundreds of pairs of workers from neighbouring colonies antennate one another while adopting a tip toe posture with the abdomen raised . These displays rarely escalate into physical contests with their typically fatal consequences . A display between two workers may cease by one worker leaving or if one displaying worker is replaced by a nestmate . We asked whether these collective displays act to convey reliable information about relative colony size . Our field experiments and observations reveal that these displays do not necessarily convey precise information about relative colony size and that it is possible for colonies to signal an exaggerated colony size at least in the short term .

@highlight Myriad workers aggregate between adjacent colonies forming a collective display.
@highlight Dyadic displays between non nestmate workers rarely escalate into physical contests.
@highlight Dyadic displays frequently involve one worker replacing another.
@highlight Worker replacement frequency can convey information about relative colony size.
@highlight Colonies can be economical with the truth about their relative colony size.
