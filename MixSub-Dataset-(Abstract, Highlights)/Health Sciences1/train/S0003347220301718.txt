 Social information percolates through a variety of channels to influence animal decision making with a notable effect on reproductive and feeding success . Colonial central place foragers can reduce time to locate ephemeral food patches and or increase foraging rate by following their informed peers parasitizing direction of returning successful foragers or being intentionally informed on distant food locations at the colony . Ceremonial behaviours may also deliver social foraging information between mates which can spread inadvertently to neighbours . Here we tested for information display in Cape gannets
