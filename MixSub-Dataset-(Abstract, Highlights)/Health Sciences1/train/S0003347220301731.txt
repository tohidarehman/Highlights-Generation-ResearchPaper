 Dominance hierarchies structure the adult social networks of many mammals . To identify the conditions that support the establishment of stable hierarchical relationships within groups of familiar rivals we explored the ontogeny of spatial social and communicative behaviour among male northern elephant seals

@highlight We explored spatial social and communicative behaviour in male elephant seals.
@highlight Subadults 6 years showed high variability in spatial social and vocal behaviour.
@highlight Adults had long residency times small home ranges and familiar adult competitors.
@highlight Adult vocal displays were stable and individually unique facilitating recognition.
