 In cooperatively breeding societies dominant breeders are assisted by other individuals in raising their young . In many of these species helping behaviours and their benefits for breeders have been studied by investigating the helpers contribution to direct offspring care even though a significant proportion of help is not targeted specifically to offspring . Here we investigated how breeders and helpers share the effort in shelter maintenance and how their investment is influenced by the presence of dependent young in the cooperatively breeding cichlid

@highlight Helpers of cooperatively breeding cichlids increase reproductive success of breeders.
@highlight Experimental increase in workload fosters division of labour among group members.
@highlight Helpers care more in the presence of young and reduce the workload of breeders.
@highlight Digging out shelters is an important investment benefiting all group members.
