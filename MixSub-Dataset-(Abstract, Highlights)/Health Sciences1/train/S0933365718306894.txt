 Physiological signals can be utilized to monitor conditions of a driver but the inter subject variance of physiological signals can degrade the classification accuracy of the monitoring system . Personalization of the system using the data of a tested subject called local data can be a solution but the acquisition of sufficient local data may not be possible in real situations . Therefore this paper proposes an effective personalizing method using small sized local data . The proposed method utilizes a fuzzy support vector machine to allocate higher weight to the local data than to others and a fuzzy membership is assigned to the training data by analyzing the importance of each datum . Three classification problems for a physiological signal based driver monitoring system are introduced and utilized to validate the proposed method . The classification accuracy is compared with that of other personalizing methods and the results show that the proposed method achieves a better accuracy on average which is 3.46 higher than that of the simple approach using a basic support vector machine thereby proving its effectiveness . The proposed method can train a personalized classifier with improved accuracy for a tested subject . The advantages of the proposed method can be utilized to develop a practical driver monitoring system .
