 Animals living in heterogeneous landscapes are often faced with making a trade off between maximizing foraging success and avoiding risk . Using high resolution GPS tracking data this study explored the fine scale movement patterns and risk sensitivity of crop raiding African elephants

@highlight Elephants move faster and straighter with closer temporal proximity to farmland.
@highlight Inside farmland elephants decrease speed and likelihood of moving straight.
@highlight Elephants may consider the nutritional gain from crop raiding to outweigh the risks.
