 People living with HIV AIDS are a vulnerable group who experience multiple physiological and psychological symptoms . A better understanding of unmet symptom management needs will allow researchers to design interventions that are more reflective of deficits in care and more effective at improving patient care . Few studies have focused on unmet needs for symptom management in PLWHA particularly in China . Factors influencing Chinese PLWHA symptom management needs are rarely discussed . The purpose of this study was to investigate the unmet needs for symptom management of PLWHA and how their symptom burden HIV perceived stigma and self management capacity contributes to HIV related self management practices in Shanghai China . Study participants were recruited from the outpatient and inpatient HIV AIDS wards in an infectious hospital in Shanghai China . Self administered questionnaires were implemented and medical charts were reviewed . A total of 367 participants was recruited from April to September 2017 . The results show that 53.1 of participants presented at least one unmet symptom management need and that symptom burden as well as perceived stigma reduced self management capacity and no employment significantly affected unmet symptom management needs . The findings indicate that there is room for improvement in symptom management for Chinese PLWHA . Culturally appropriate interventions focusing on improving symptom burden decreasing HIV perceived stigma and enhancing self management capacity can enhance symptom management in this population .

@highlight More than half 53.1 of Chinese PLWHA had at least one unmet symptom management need.
