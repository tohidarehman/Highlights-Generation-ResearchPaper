 Many species use early life sensory experiences to guide phenotypic plasticity and facilitate decision making during later adult settlement in new habitats or location of suitable resources . However only some of the available sensory information in the environment is relevant for future decision making and in addition it may only be informative during certain times during development . This means that sampling of environmental information that should be retained to adulthood could be limited to certain sensitive periods . In the polyphagous moth

@highlight Larval experience affects adult moth host plant decisions.
@highlight There is a sensitive period for host plant cue transfer over the full metamorphosis.
@highlight Only experience at late larval instars affects adult host plant choice decisions.
@highlight Adults use innate preference when exposed to early instar plant experience.
