 In resource defence mating systems where males control nest sites complex interrelationships between nest characteristics and nest advertisement are likely to influence female mate choice . Surprisingly however we know little about the influence of such relationships on female mating decisions . In terrestrial breeding oviparous species one character likely to have a major influence on female nest site selection is nest moisture . In addition to influencing the susceptibility of eggs to desiccation nest moisture also stands to influence nest pH and offspring fitness as well as the hydration state of resident males and their potential to advertise . Together such interrelationships could strongly influence female mating decisions . The aim of this study was to use a long term field study combined with a multivariate approach to investigate the combined influence of nest moisture nest pH and male acoustic advertisement on female nest site selection in a wild population of red backed toadlets

@highlight We examined the influence of moisture pH and calling on female nest site selection.
@highlight Females deposited more eggs in wetter and less acidic nests.
@highlight Nest moisture and pH were positively related to the calling potential of males.
@highlight Female mate choice is influenced by a complex interplay between nest traits.
@highlight Nesting behaviour may be mechanistically intertwined with mate choice.
