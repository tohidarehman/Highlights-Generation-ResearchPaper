 Synonym mapping between phenotype concepts from different terminologies is difficult because terminology databases have been developed largely independently . Existing maps of synonymous phenotype concepts from different terminology databases are highly incomplete and manually mapping is time consuming and laborious . Therefore building an automatic method for predictive mapping of synonymous phenotypes is of special importance . We propose a classifier based phenotype mapping prediction model to predict synonymous relationships between phenotype concepts from different terminology databases . The model takes network semantic representations of phenotypes as input and predicts synonymous relationships by training binary classifiers with a voting strategy . We compared the performance of the CPM with a similarity based phenotype mapping prediction model which predicts mapping based on the ranked cosine similarity of candidate mapping concepts . Based on a network representation N2V TFIDF with a majority voting strategy method MV the CPM achieved accuracy of 0.943 which was 15.4 higher than that of the SPM using the cosine similarity method and 23.8 higher than that of the SSDTM method proposed in our previous work .
