 To measure the role of nurses and midwives in reducing obstetric trauma as a proxy for safety failures during childbirth in member countries of Organization for Economic Co operation and Development . The number of practicing nurses and midwives density per 1000 population and the proportion of third and fourth degree obstetric trauma during vaginal delivery with instrument OT The results of panel co integration test and dynamic long run models confirm that there were meaningful relationships from the level of nursing and midwifery staff to reducing OECD s obstetric trauma indicators with long run magnitudes of 15.8614 for OT A higher proportion of nursing and midwifery staff is associated with higher patient safety during childbirth in OECD countries . Overall our findings alert policy makers to consider the deleterious impacts of shortage in the level of nursing and midwifery staff on declining patient safety during childbirth as well as quality of acute care in OECD .

@highlight There is a lack of cross national analysis to measure the role of nurses and midwives in reducing safety failures during childbirth nationally and globally.
@highlight There were long run relationships from the level of nursing and midwifery staff to improving patient safety during childbirth in OECD.
@highlight Obstetric trauma with instrument is more sensitive to the level of nursing and midwifery staff than without instrument due to proper care needed in deliveries using forceps or vacuum extraction.
@highlight If the relationships between nursing and midwifery staff and patient safety indicators for childbirth are disturbed by shortage in the level of nursing and midwifery satff then the time span of correcting back to long run equilibrium is at least 18 years.
@highlight The findings of this study highlight the value of investment in nursing and midwifery related services associated with increasing patient safety during childbirth in OECD.
