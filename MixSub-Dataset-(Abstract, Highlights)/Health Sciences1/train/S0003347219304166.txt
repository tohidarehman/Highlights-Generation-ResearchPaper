 In mammals characterized by a mating system in which a single male monopolizes reproduction infanticide is reported to occur following a male take over often resulting in females returning to oestrus more rapidly than if their infant has survived . However over the course of a 17 year study of golden snub nosed monkeys

@highlight Infanticide is common in polygynous mammals but varies across species.
@highlight We found no infanticide in a 17 year study of polygynous wild snub nosed monkeys.
@highlight Social network and genetic analyses show most infants are from extrapair matings.
@highlight Female golden snub nosed monkey might reduce infanticide by confusing paternity.
@highlight Highly cohesive multilevel sociality may facilitate alternative reproductive tactics.
