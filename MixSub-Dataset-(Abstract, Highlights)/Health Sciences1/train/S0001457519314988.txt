 It has been widely agreed that it is risky for patients with diabetes to drive during hypoglycemia . However driving during non hypoglycemia may also bring certain safety hazards for some patients with diabetes . Based on previous studies on diabetes related to early aging effect as well as gender differences in health belief and driving behavior we have hypothesized that middle aged male drivers with type 2 diabetes compared with the control healthy ones may experience a decline in driving performance without awareness . And the decline is caused by impaired perceptual and cognitive driving related functions . To verify these hypotheses we recruited 56 non professional male drivers aged between 40 and 60 to perform a simulated car following task and finish behavioral tests of proprioception visual search and working memory abilities during non hypoglycemia . They also reported their hypoglycemia experience and perceived driving skills . We found that the patients had equal confidence in their driving skills but worse driving performance as shown in larger centerline deviation longer brake reaction time and shorter minimum time to collision . Such between group differences in driving performance could be fully mediated by proprioception visual search ability and working memory capacity but not by hypoglycemia experience . Regarding the effect sizes of the mediation the visual search ability played the most important role and then followed the working memory and the proprioception .

@highlight Middle aged type 2 diabetic men had no reduced confidence in their driving skills.
@highlight These diabetic drivers showed deteriorated driving performance in non hypoglycemia.
@highlight Hypoglycemia experience was not predictive of their driving performance decline.
@highlight Perceptual cognitive functions can fully explain such driving performance decline.
