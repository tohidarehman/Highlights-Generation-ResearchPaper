 There is extensive literature into the mechanisms of injury in traffic crashes involving vulnerable road users but little research into the social or psychological factors in causation in these crash types . Attitudes and emotional associations can affect how people attend to objects in their visual environment and physical approach avoidance responses but few studies have extended these approaches into the road safety domain . Existing driving simulator studies of driver bicyclist interactions have focused on driver behavior but not underlying attitudes and their effect on safety related behaviors .

@highlight The novel methodology linked 105 respondents conscious and subconscious attitudes with a simulated driving task
@highlight Nearly one half of driving simulator participants close passed the bicyclist
@highlight Negative attitudes toward bicyclists predicted passing distance speed and time to collision
@highlight People with negative attitudes about bicyclists as legitimate roadway users had a higher maximum speed while passing
@highlight Self identified cyclists passed at higher speeds while people who bicycle at least weekly passed closer but more slowly
