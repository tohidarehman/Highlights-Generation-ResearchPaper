 The nonlinearity and fear hypothesis predicts that the structure of alarm vocalizations will be influenced by the signaller s internal state . Specifically stressed or otherwise more aroused individuals will produce alarm calls that are relatively more nonlinear . The position of an individual in a social network can influence an individual s sense of security . More centrally located individuals may feel more secure and thus we might expect that they would produce noisier calls . Building on previous research about the influence of social relationships on an individual s sense of security we asked whether social network position explained variation in the noisiness and goodness of pitch of alarm calls produced by trapped yellow bellied marmots

@highlight Socially isolated marmots lower outstrength produce noisier alarm calls.
@highlight Social relationships may influence how individuals perceive their safety.
