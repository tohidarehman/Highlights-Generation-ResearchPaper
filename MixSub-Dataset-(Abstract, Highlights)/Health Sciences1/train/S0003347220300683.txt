 Intraspecific morphological variation fundamentally influences individual resource exploitation . In plantpollinator systems variation in floral morphologies and pollinator mouthparts may affect pollinators resource use . This relationship has frequently been studied across species but hardly ever at the intraspecific level in natural circumstances . We studied flower visits of clouded Apollo butterflies

@highlight Clouded Apollo butterflies mouthpart lengths show high population wise variability.
@highlight Similar variability is found in the visited nectar sources corolla depth.
@highlight Butterflies with long proboscides visit nectar plant with deepest flowers more often.
@highlight Intraspecific variation is important to understand plant pollinator interactions.
@highlight Intraspecific variation s impact does not support pollination syndrome hypothesis.
