 Some crab spiders can change their colour to match the flower they use as a hunting platform and in choice trials they select same colour flowers over contrasting flowers . Colour change is a costly physiological process that could help spiders capture more prey or avoid predators . There is no evidence however that crypsis increases the hunting success of spiders and its effect on predator avoidance has not been studied . To evaluate the effect of crypsis on predation rate we tethered yellow crab spiders

@highlight In our field site most crab spiders are yellow and ambush prey on yellow daisies.
@highlight Yellow spiders suffer greater predation rates on white than on yellow flowers.
@highlight Spiders increase their hunting success when moved to purple flowers they never use.
@highlight Colour matching evolved to minimize predation rate not to maximize hunting success.
