 Individuals and groups within the same population may differ in their use of resources . Also referred to as niche specialization such differences can be documented through direct or indirect observation of resource or habitat use . Here we examined selective habitat use in alliance forming male Indo Pacific bottlenose dolphins

@highlight Niche specialization can occur among individuals and groups within populations.
@highlight Male dolphin alliances each of 314 members cooperate to secure oestrous females.
@highlight Alliances inhabit overlapping ranges with similar proportions of available habitats.
@highlight Alliances with overlapping ranges and similar habitats forage in different habitats.
@highlight Thus food as well as females may explain marked differences in alliance tactics.
