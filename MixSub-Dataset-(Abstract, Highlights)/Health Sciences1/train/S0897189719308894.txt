 We aimed to describe the amount of treatment burden experienced in the primary care population diagnosed with chronic conditions and examine if cumulative and task specific treatment burden were predictors of medication exercise and dietary adherence in patients diagnosed with chronic conditions . We conducted a prospective descriptive cross sectional study . We enrolled 149 men and women from a single primary care clinic . Participants completed self report surveys with data collected between September 2019 and December 2019 . Our primary statistical analyses consisted of multivariate regression modeling . The sample experience a moderate amount of treatment burden . We found strong negative correlations between both cumulative and task specific burden in relation to medication exercise and dietary adherence Results demonstrate higher levels of cumulative and task specific treatment burden predict medication exercise and dietary adherence within a sample diagnosed with various chronic conditions . These findings indicate the potential for using treatment burden screening in the clinical setting to identify individuals at risk for poor self management adherence . Treatment burden screening also enables the provider to determine areas of high burden affecting self management adherence in order to design an effective treatment plan using targeted interventions resources or education to reduce patient burden in order to improve adherence .

@highlight Our primary care sample experienced a moderate amount of treatment burden.
@highlight The most frequent factors associated with high burden were diet exercise and finances.
@highlight High levels of cumulative treatment burden predicted lower medication adherence.
@highlight High levels of task specific treatment burden predicted lower medication exercise and diet adherence.
@highlight Treatment burden screening in primary care setting could inform providers what patients are at risk for poor adherence.
