 Insect societies are challenged by harmful pathogens that originate from waste such as faeces food leftovers or corpses . The discarding of waste to outside the nest reduces these sanitary risks and contributes to the social immunity of ant colonies . In this study we tested whether the nest cleaning behaviour in

@highlight Ant colonies adapt nest cleaning based on waste pathogenicity and brood presence.
@highlight The greater the pathogenicity of waste the faster it was discarded by the ants.
@highlight The presence of the brood enhanced the hygienic response of workers.
@highlight Efficiency of sanitary behaviour was not correlated with workers immune defences.
