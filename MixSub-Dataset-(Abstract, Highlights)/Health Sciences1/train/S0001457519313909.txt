 To deal with the increasing number of motor vehicle collisions among older drivers a cognitive test has been introduced to a license renewal procedure for drivers aged 75 years since June 2009 . This might have prompted the reduction or cessation of driving by older drivers . We therefore examined whether older drivers chance of experiencing MVCs as unprotected road users has increased after the test was introduced . Using police reported national data on MVCs from January 2005 through December 2016 we calculated the monthly injury rates among unprotected road users by sex and age group . The ratios of the injury rates of unprotected road users in the three oldest age groups to those aged 7074 years were also calculated . Then we conducted an interrupted time series analysis based on the injury rate ratios to control for extraneous factors affecting MVCs over the study period . There was a significant increase in traffic injuries of unprotected road users at the time the test was introduced among females aged 7584 years and at a later time among males aged 80 years and females aged 85 years . Licensing policies for older drivers should be rigorously evaluated taking into account the safety of older unprotected road users and should be balanced against it .

@highlight Stringent licensing for older drivers might prompt premature driving cessation.
@highlight A cognitive test was added to older drivers license renewal procedure in Japan.
@highlight Injury risk increased in older unprotected road users afterwards.
@highlight This risk increase is possibly due to modal shift from driving to non driving.
@highlight Licensing policies should take into account the safety of unprotected road users.
