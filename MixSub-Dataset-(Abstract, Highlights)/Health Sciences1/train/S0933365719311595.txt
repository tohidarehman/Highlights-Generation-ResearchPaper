 Two common issues may arise in certain population based breast cancer survival studies I missing values in a survivals predictive variable such as Stage at diagnosis and II small sample size due to imbalance class problem in certain subsets of patients demanding data modeling simulation methods . We present a procedure In both MCAR and MNAR scenarios all models showed poorer prediction performance compared to three GM models the saturated one and two with penalty factors on the partial likelihood . However GM.SAT predictions could lead to non reliable conclusions in BC survival analysis . Simulation of a synthetic dataset derived from GM.SAT could be the worst strategy but the use of the remaining GMs models could be better than oversampling . Our results suggest the use of the GM procedure presented for one variable imputation prediction of missing data and for simulating synthetic BC survival datasets . The synthetic datasets derived from GMs could be also used in clinical applications of cancer survival data such as predictive risk analysis .

@highlight ModGraProDep addresses missing data and small sample size issues in survival analysis.
@highlight It provides 4 models which could outperform useful algorithms for these issues.
@highlight It also allows for identifying probability dependencies between variables.
@highlight Saturated models should be discarded for any imputation data simulation task.
