 Animals may face trade offs when several simultaneous functions or processes compete for limiting resources . In that context allocation of resources to the most fitness enhancing competing function can be prioritized . Immune response and locomotor performance are relevant fitness components mainly due to their important roles as defence against pathogens and predators respectively . However both promote oxidative stress and consume energy and metabolites . Consistently trade offs between immune response and locomotion have been reported in some taxa . In this work we examine whether an immune challenge hinders short distance swimming speed of adult Iberian ribbed newts

@highlight We examined potential immune systemlocomotion trade offs in adult newts.
@highlight We used
@highlight cell wall lipopolysaccharide LPS to trigger an immune response.
@highlight An immune challenge by LPS did not affect newt swimming speed.
@highlight The results were consistent 24
@highlight None
@highlight h and 7 days following the challenge.
@highlight Locomotion could be prioritized due to its important antipredator role.
