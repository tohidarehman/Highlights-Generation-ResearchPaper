 Automatic arrhythmia detection based on electrocardiogram is of great significance for early prevention and diagnosis of cardiac diseases . Recently deep learning methods have been applied to arrhythmia detection and obtained great success . Among them convolutional neural network is an effective method for extracting features due to its local connectivity and parameter sharing . In addition recurrent neural network is another commonly used method which is applied to process time series signal . The stacking of both CNN and RNN has been proved to be more effective in multi class arrhythmia detection . However these networks ignored the fact that different channels and temporal segments of a feature map extracted from the 12 lead ECG signal contribute differently to cardiac arrhythmia detection and thus the classification performance could be greatly improved . To address this issue spatio temporal attention based convolutional recurrent neural network is proposed to focus on representative features along both spatial and temporal axes . STA CRNN consists of CNN subnetwork spatio temporal attention modules and RNN subnetwork . The experiment result shows that STA CRNN reaches an average

@highlight A novel neural network model STA CRNN is proposed by incorporating spatio temporal attention mechanism into convolutional recurrent neural network. Spatial and temporal attention mechanisms assign weights for channels and temporal segments of a feature map respectively. The purpose is to emphasize the informative features and suppress unimportant ones along two principle dimensions spatial and temporal axes. Comparing with the state of the art works this study further improves the performance of arrhythmia classification.
