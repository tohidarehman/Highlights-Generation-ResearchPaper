 A hierarchical Bayesian peak over threshold approach is proposed for conflict based before after safety evaluation of Leading Pedestrian Intervals . The approach combines traffic conflicts of different sites and periods to develop a uniform generalized Pareto distribution model for the treatment effect estimation . The hierarchical structure has three levels a data level that consists of modeling the traffic conflict extremes through the POT approach a latent process level that relates GPD parameters of the data level to certain covariates and a prior level with prior distributions to characterize the latent process . The approach was applied to a before after safety evaluation of leading pedestrian interval in Vancouver BC . Pedestrian vehicle traffic conflicts were collected from treatment and control sites during the before and after periods using an automated computer vision analysis technique . The treatment effect was measured by the best fitted GPD model with the calculation of the odds ratio . The overall treatment effect varies from 18.1 20.9 in terms of reduction in the estimated extreme serious conflicts . The treatment effect indicates a considerable improvement in pedestrian safety after the implementation of the LPI and the consistent results demonstrate a reliable BA safety evaluation . As such the proposed approach is recommended as a promising tool for BA safety studies particularly in cases where collision data is limited .
