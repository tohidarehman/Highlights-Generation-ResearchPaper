 Electronic Medical Records contain temporal and heterogeneous doctor order information that can be used for treatment pattern discovery . Our objective is to identify right patient right drug right dose right route and right time from doctor order information . We propose a fusion framework to extract typical treatment patterns based on multi view similarity Network Fusion method . The multi view SNF method involves three similarity measures content view similarity sequence view similarity and duration view similarity . An EMR dataset and two metrics were utilized to evaluate the performance and to extract typical treatment patterns . Experimental results on a real world EMR dataset show that the multi view similarity network fusion method outperforms all the single view similarity measures and also outperforms the existing similarity measure methods . Furthermore we extract and visualize typical treatment patterns by clustering analysis . The extracted typical treatment patterns by combining doctor order content sequence and duration views can provide data driven guidelines for artificial intelligence in medicine and help clinicians make better decisions in clinical practice .

@highlight Temporal and content information of patient treatments is analysed in depth.
@highlight A fusion framework based on multi view similarity fusion method is proposed.
@highlight Three similarity measures from content sequence and duration are designed.
@highlight The fusion method is applied on real EMRs to extract typical treatment patterns.
