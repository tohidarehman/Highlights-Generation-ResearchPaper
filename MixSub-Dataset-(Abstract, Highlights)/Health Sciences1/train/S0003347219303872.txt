 Individuals exhibit consistent differences in behaviour and related cognitive performance . Cognitive styles based hypotheses suggest the trade off between speed and accuracy is an important factor where an individual s behavioural traits and linked decision speeds may account for its cognitive performance . The expected relationship between accuracy and decision speed however is not always clear and some studies have suggested that faster individuals do not suffer the expected cost to accuracy . Contradictory findings may be attributed to taxon specific differences but may also be due to the difficulty in separating intraindividual from interindividual variation or the use of insufficiently challenging tasks in tests . We trained archerfish

@highlight We report evidence to support the cognitive styles hypothesis in archerfish.
@highlight Consistently fast fish learn to shoot novel targets quicker than slower fish.
@highlight Consistently slower fish have greater discrimination success in three choice tests.
@highlight Even with differential rewards two choice tests fail to reveal cognitive styles.
