 The rationale for in utero hematopoietic cell transplantation rests on exploitation of normal events during hematopoietic and immunologic ontogeny to allow allogeneic hematopoietic engraftment without myeloablative conditioning . Host hematopoietic competition is among the primary barriers to engraftment in IUHCT . In the murine model this can be partially overcome by delivery of larger donor cell doses but volume is limiting . Enrichment of donor hematopoietic stem cells would seem to offer a more efficient approach but such enriched populations have engrafted poorly in existing models of IUHCT . To increase HSC dose while maintaining the presence of accessory cells we used a less stringent enrichment protocol of single step lineage depleted cells alone or in combination with whole donor bone marrow mononuclear cells . Our results confirm that increasing doses of HSCs in combination with bone marrow accessory cells can dramatically improve engraftment after IUHCT . This represents a practical and clinically applicable strategy to maximize the engraftment potential of the donor graft without risk of treatment associated toxicity .

@highlight Highly enriched donor cell populations engraft poorly in a murine model of IUHCT.
@highlight The addition of accessory BM MNC to an enriched population improves engraftment.
@highlight This is a practical and clinically applicable strategy to increase donor chimerism.
