 Forklifts are among the machines involved with the highest levels of occupational fatalities . As many accidents involved with a forklift can be attributed to the low situation awareness of the operator it is essential to understand the factors influencing a forklift operators SA for reducing forklift accidents especially of collision type . Against this background this research aims to investigate how a forklift operators SA about other people around can be influenced by the type of subtasks they are carrying out . In this research a virtual reality environment is used as the experiment environment in which subjects perform a series of subtasks such as driving turning reversing loading and unloading with a VR forklift simulation model . A SAGATan established SA measurement technique based on a series of queries targeting Level 1 2 and 3 SAis used as the main method to collect data about subjects SA in the experiment . The analysis of the data reveals that a forklift operator is likely to have a reduced SA about the workers around when he she is performing a loading or unloading task due to attention narrowing which occurs when a person concentrates on a cognitively demanding task . The findings provide insights into how forklift operator SA could be improved through an SA oriented safety training program and also how sensing technologies might assist forklift operators with maintaining a good SA .

@highlight Limited situation awareness SA may cause accidents while operating a mobile plant.
@highlight Mobile plant operators SA of other people in proximity is investigated.
@highlight Forklift operators SA about other workers is affected by the complexity of the subtasks.
@highlight Control measures are proposed to prevent struck by or caught in between accidents.
