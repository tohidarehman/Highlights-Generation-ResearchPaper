 Music can influence car following performance . However it is not well resolved about its mediation effect on car following when the drivers personalities are considered . We investigated how music style and tempo influence car following with different personalities . Twelve tracks were used in this study four for each music tempo range i.e . slow medium and fast tempo and six for each music style i.e . classical and pop one . The results showed introverts were more susceptible to music and tend to listen to slow tempo music and classical one . In addition pop music aroused the drivers more than classical and may induce closer headway distance . Furthermore with the tempo speeding up the drivers were more excited less concentrated and performed less stablely . The medium music tempo was the most appropriate choice for keeping stable headway distance and taking actions to the changes of the leading vehicle . The present study shows personality can mediate the influence of music listening while driving and music style and tempo can impact the mediation in a specific way . The study provides a guide on the music choice during driving and may bring benefits to the configuration of the music radio program and car music player .
