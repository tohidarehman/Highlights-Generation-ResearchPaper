 To validate the psychometrics of the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model and identify the prevalence of intrinsic fall risk factors in a diverse multisite population . Injurious inpatient falls are common events and hospitals have implemented programs to achieve zero inpatient falls . Retrospective analysis of patient data from electronic health records at nine hospitals that are part of Ascension . Participants were adult inpatients . Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.765 standard error 0.008 95 confidence interval 0.748 0.781 Analysis of this very large inpatient sample confirmed the strong psychometric characteristics of the HIIFRM . The study also identified a large number of inpatients with multiple fall risk factors

@highlight This large study confirmed the predictive ability of the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model.
@highlight A large proportion of inpatients have multiple intrinsic fall risk factors.
@highlight Fall programs must evolve beyond a focus solely on environmental factors.
@highlight Modifiable fall risk factors should be mapped to evidence based interventions.
@highlight Regulatory policy and practice changes are needed to transform fall programs.
