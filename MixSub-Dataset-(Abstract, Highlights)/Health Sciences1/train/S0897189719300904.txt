 Persons living with HIV experience high symptom burden that can negatively impact medication adherence work productivity and quality of life . Symptoms are highly subjective which can lead to under or improper treatment . The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine relationships between circulating biomarkers representative of inflammatory coagulation and vascular function pathways and prevalent HIV symptoms . Symptom burden was measured with the HIV Symptom Index depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire . Human multiplex kits were used to determine serum concentrations of select biomarkers representing inflammatory coagulation and vascular function pathways . The biomarkers were included as features in machine learning models to determine which biomarkers predicted the most prevalent HIV symptoms and the symptom of depression . Participants Biomarker clusters can be a tool to monitor symptoms . Adding an objective measure to subjective patient experiences could improve management and monitoring of symptoms . Defining a biomarker cluster for the objective assessment of HIV symptoms warrants further investigation however the presence of comorbid conditions needs to be controlled .

@highlight Objective measures of symptoms may be possible to develop.
@highlight Depression in people living with HIV was predicted by age gender glucose hemoglobin A1c and inflammation.
@highlight Muscle joint pain was predicted by adiponectin c reactive protein and serum amyloid a SAA .
@highlight Fatigue was predicted by adiponectin SAA and soluble Interleukin sIL 1RII.
