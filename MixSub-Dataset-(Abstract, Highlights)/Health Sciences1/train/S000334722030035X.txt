 Many animals have colour patterns that appear to change dynamically when the animal moves . Experiments have suggested that such colour patterns termed dynamic flash coloration can reduce predatory attacks by misrepresenting the prey s location . However the conditions that make this coloration effective are not known . We here tested the influence of two factors target size and unpredictable movement on the efficacy of dynamic flash coloration . Both these factors have independently been shown to affect the predator s ability to attack a moving prey accurately but whether they interact with prey coloration remains unclear . Using a virtual predation experiment with human participants we found that the effectiveness of dynamic flash coloration when compared to background matching coloration declined as the size of the target increased but only when the target movement was linear . However when the movement was unpredictable we found dynamic flash coloration to be effective in reducing the number and accuracy of attacks irrespective of target size . Under most conditions the effectiveness of dynamic flash coloration did not differ from that of a uniform luminance matched grey target . Our results suggest that the efficacy of dynamic flash coloration is limited by prey size but animals can overcome this constraint by employing an unpredictable movement trajectory . The study also provides direct empirical evidence that protean antipredator behaviour influences the effectiveness of prey coloration that works in motion .

@highlight Dynamic change in prey colour during motion may reduce predatory attacks.
@highlight We tested the factors affecting the effectiveness of dynamic coloration.
@highlight When movement was linear dynamic coloration was effective only in small targets.
@highlight It was effective irrespective of size when the movement path was unpredictable.
@highlight Its evolution might be affected by prey size and escape trajectory.
