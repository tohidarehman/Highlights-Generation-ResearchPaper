 Social communication systems are predominantly multimodal and can combine modulatory and information bearing signals . The honey bee waggle dance one of the most elaborate forms of social communication in animals activates nestmates to search for food and communicates symbolic information about the location of the food source . Previous studies on the dance behaviour in diverse honey bee species demonstrated distinct differences in the concurrence of visual auditory olfactory and tactile signals produced by the dancer . We studied the behaviour of dance signal receivers the dance followers to explore the potential significance of different signals in the communication process . In particular we asked whether the behaviour of dance followers differs between the three major Asian honey bee species

@highlight Honey bee species differ in the set of signals produced in the waggle dance.
@highlight Dance followers candidate signal recipients were observed in three Asian species.
@highlight Follower behaviour throughout the waggle dance was highly similar across species.
@highlight Most followers oriented lateral to the dancer with a mean body angle of 90.
@highlight The spatial information transfer mechanism is probably conserved across species.
