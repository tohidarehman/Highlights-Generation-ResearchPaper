 Neophobia the fear response of organisms towards novel cues is a phenotypically plastic trait that manifests among prey that experience uncertain often high levels of risk . Prey that find themselves in uncertain or highly variable risk environments over ecological and evolutionary time could benefit from reducing the costs associated with making a bad decision when they detect novel or unknown predatory threat . Hence understanding ecological uncertainty in the context of prey decision making is of key interest . While ecological uncertainty remains a poorly defined concept the degree of uncertainty experienced by prey and by extension neophobia should be influenced by the predictability of risk . Here we test whether prey exposed to the same overall level of predation risk exhibit stronger neophobic responses towards a standardized novel cue when they experience the risk in an unpredictable versus predicable manner .

@highlight Neophobia is a phenotypically plastic response by prey to uncertain risk.
@highlight Elevated mean predation risk and predictability of risk should drive neophobia.
@highlight We exposed dace to predictable or unpredictable risk at high vs low levels.
@highlight Neophobic responses were stronger following exposure to unpredictable risk.
@highlight Risk unpredictability is a critical factor driving neophobia within prey populations.
