 While computer vision techniques and big data of street level imagery are getting increasing attention a black box model of deep learning hinders the active application of these techniques to the field of traffic safety research . To address this issue we presented a semantic scene labeling approach that leverages wide coverage street level imagery for the purpose of exploring the association between built environment characteristics and perceived crash risk at 533 intersections . The environmental attributes were measured at eye level using scene segmentation and object detection algorithms and they were classified as one of four intersection typologies using the k means clustering method . Data on perceived crash risk were collected from a questionnaire conducted on 799 children 10 to 12 years old . Our results showed that environmental features derived from deep learning algorithms were significantly associated with perceived crash risk among school aged children . The results have revealed that some of the intersection characteristics including the proportional area of sky and roadway were significantly associated with the perceived crash risk among school aged children . In particular road width had dominant influence on risk perception . The findings provide information useful to providing appropriate and proactive interventions that may reduce the risk of crashes at intersections .
