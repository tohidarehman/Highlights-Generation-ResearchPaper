 Comparative studies aid in our understanding of specific conditions favouring the initial evolution of different types of social behaviours yet there is much unexplained intraspecific variation in the expression of social behaviour that comparative studies have not yet addressed . The proximate causes of this individual variation in social behaviour within a species have been examined in some species but its fitness consequences have been less frequently investigated . In this study we quantified the fitness consequences of variation in the sociality of prairie voles

@highlight Prairie voles exhibit substantial within species variation in social behaviour.
@highlight We examined the fitness consequences of individual variation in social behaviour.
@highlight Voles with an intermediate level of sociality had the highest mating success.
@highlight Voles with intermediate sociality with all voles had higher reproductive success.
@highlight Males with an intermediate number of social connections had higher mean body mass.
