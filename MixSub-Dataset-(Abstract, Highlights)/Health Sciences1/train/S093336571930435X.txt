 Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder in humans . Electroencephalogram is a prevalent tool for diagnosing the epileptic seizure activity in clinical which provides valuable information for understanding the physiological mechanisms behind epileptic disorders . Approximate entropy and recurrence quantification analysis are nonlinear analysis tools to quantify the complexity and recurrence behaviors of non stationary signals respectively . Convolutional neural networks are powerful class of models . In this paper a new method for automatic epileptic electroencephalogram recordings based on the approximate entropy and recurrence quantification analysis combined with a convolutional neural network were proposed . The Bonn dataset was used to assess the proposed approach . The results indicated that the performance of the epileptic seizure detection by approximate entropy and recurrence quantification analysis is good especially the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of the recurrence rate achieved 92.17 91.75 and 92.00 . When combines the approximate entropy and recurrence quantification analysis features with convolutional neural networks to automatically differentiate seizure electroencephalogram from normal recordings the classification result can reach to 98.84 99.35 and 99.26 . Thus this makes automatic detection of epileptic recordings become possible and it would be a valuable tool for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy .
