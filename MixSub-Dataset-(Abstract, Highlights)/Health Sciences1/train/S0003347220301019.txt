 Nest construction is a widespread behaviour that is a critical fitness investment in many taxa . Nests provide stable environments for offspring production development and at times adult survival . Avian nest structure and composition has been linked to insulative properties and the reduction of energetic requirements for incubating females . However it is unclear how and why nest structure varies across landscapes within and between species especially in cavity nesting species . Here we examined nest size in a secondary cavity nester the mountain chickadee

@highlight Nest sizes of mountain chickadees were not related to environmental temperatures.
@highlight Reproductive parameters were not associated with nest size or temperature.
@highlight Nest sizes of returning females were highly repeatable across years.
