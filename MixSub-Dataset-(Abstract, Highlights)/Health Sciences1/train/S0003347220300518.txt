 An appreciation of the diverse roots of animal behaviour study is essential for informed teaching and stimulating current research and scholarship . Insights by early seminal authors are often ignored insights that may have avoided subsequent controversies or spawned productive research . Even with internet access now available for much early work historical perspectives are increasingly being lost . Animal behaviour textbooks are often misleading and simplistic on historical matters . In this paper I document how four authors writing 100 or more years ago greatly influenced my research on nonavian reptile behaviour . These four authors which merit serious re reading by students of virtually any taxa and topic are Jakob von Uexkll Margaret Floy Washburn James Mark Baldwin and Wallace Craig . There are also current and upcoming challenges and risks impacting animal behaviour research that may affect how today s research will be viewed in historical perspectives 50 100 or more years from now .

@highlight I discuss the importance and relevance of four pioneers in animal behaviour.
@highlight Specifically I focus on early work by von Uexkll Washburn Baldwin and Craig.
@highlight I also identify threats to the historical evaluation of animal behaviour research.
