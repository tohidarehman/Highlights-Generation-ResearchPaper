 Inhibitory control is the ability to resist performing a prepotent but ultimately incorrect behaviour in situations that demand restraint . Inhibitory control is linked to brain size and intelligence in humans and animals but it is unclear just how it evolves . Inhibitory control is thought to be particularly important in complex social environments where demands can shift frequently based on the social context and the identities or behaviours of other individuals in a group . Indeed the social intelligence hypothesis suggests that the demands of living in complex social groups led to the evolution of sophisticated cognition . Here we tested inhibitory control in wild spotted hyaenas

@highlight For hyaenas living in larger groups may demand greater inhibitory control.
@highlight Cohort size was a stronger predictor of inhibitory control than overall group size.
@highlight Low ranking hyaenas living in larger groups had better inhibitory control.
@highlight Adult male and female hyaenas did not differ in inhibitory control.
@highlight Our results support the social intelligence hypothesis.
