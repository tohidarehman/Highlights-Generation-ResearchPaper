 In bumblebees dominance behaviour contributes to the regulation of the reproductive division of labour between queens and workers . Towards the end of the colony cycle at the onset of the competition phase reproductive workers will establish a dominance hierarchy and challenge the reproductive monopoly of the queen by laying unfertilized male destined eggs . However it has been suggested that the dominance and reproductive hierarchies in bumblebee workers are not completely aligned . By performing manipulative experiments and observing both aggressive behaviour and ovarian activation in

@highlight Dominance and reproductive hierarchies are not completely aligned in bumblebees.
@highlight Reintroduction of a queen causes worker ovary regression and restores harmony.
@highlight Worker competition is initiated by dominance displays of reproductive sisters.
@highlight Workers are aggressed based on their size rather than their reproductive state.
@highlight Subordinate small reproductive workers avoid nestmate aggression.
