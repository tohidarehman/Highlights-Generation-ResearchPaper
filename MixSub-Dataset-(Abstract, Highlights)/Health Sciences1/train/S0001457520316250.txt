 Benefiting from the rapid development of communication and intelligent vehicle technology in recent years most traffic information is capable of being collected processed and transmitted to each vehicle through a connected and automated vehicles system . To meet the higher requirements of driving safety in CAVs environment it is necessary to develop more effective safety evaluation indicators that combine all the traffic information received by the vehicle . To this end this study proposes a novel methodology for risk perception and warning strategy based on safety potential field model to minimize driving risk in the CAVs environment . A dynamic safety potential field model was constructed to describe the spatial distribution of driving risk encountered by vehicles . This safety potential field model can comprehensively consider the impact of various types of traffic information on driving risk . And then a novel driving risk indicator named potential field indicator

@highlight The acceleration and the steering angle are incorporated into potential field model for the first time.
@highlight The model is capable of showing the dynamic spatial distribution of the safe potential field under different motion conditions.
@highlight A novel risk indicator was proposed based on the safe potential field.
@highlight A warning strategy is proposed for preventing accidents.
