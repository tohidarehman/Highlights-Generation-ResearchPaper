 Imitative vocal learning has now been described in a variety of taxa but is most extensively studied for birdsong learning . However songbirds produce a variety of songs and calls that also are learned . For example black capped chickadees

@highlight We examined the role of HVC and RA in black capped chickadee vocalizations.
@highlight Gargle call production elicited the most neuronal response in HVC and RA.
@highlight Gargle calls elicited more neuronal response than fee bee song in HVC and RA.
@highlight Only the gargle call was correlated with the neuronal response in HVC and RA.
@highlight The song control system may be better described as a learned vocal control system.
