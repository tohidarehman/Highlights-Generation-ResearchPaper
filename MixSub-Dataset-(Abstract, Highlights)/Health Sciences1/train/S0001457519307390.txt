 To assess and explain finely drivers a priori acceptance of highly automated cars this study used the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology . Further the current study sought to extend upon previous research to assess if intentions to use highly automated cars in the future differed according to country . These three countries were selected to enable comparisons of a priori acceptance between countries of differing levels of exposure to highly automated cars . Participants

@highlight Applied TPB and UTAUT to assess a priori acceptance of highly automated cars.
@highlight The findings in relation to the TPB and UTAUT according to country Australia France and Sweden .
@highlight Drivers residing in France reported greater intentions to use highly automated cars in the future.
@highlight More research is required to further assess the feasibility of the TPB and UTAUT to assess intentions to use AVs.
