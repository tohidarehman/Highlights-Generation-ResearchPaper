 The structured report is a new trend for the preparation and manipulation of radiological examination reports . The structuring of the radiological report data can bring many benefits and advantages over other existing methodologies . Research and studies about the structured radiological report are highly relevant in clinical and academic subjects improving medical practice reducing unobserved problems by radiologists improving reporting practices and medical diagnoses . Exposing the benefits advantages and potential of the structured radiological report is important in encouraging the acceptance and implementation of this method by radiology professionals who are still somewhat resistant . The present review highlights the factors that contribute to the consolidation of adopting the structured radiology report methodology addressing a variety of studies focused on the structuring of the radiological report . This integrative review of the literature is proposed by searching publications and journals databases to develop a complete and unified understanding of the subject so that it becomes a major part of evidence based initiatives .

@highlight Radiology is one area of medicine that has been impacted by advances in technology especially in the area of computerization.
@highlight In this study sample evidence of the benefits advantages and potential that the structured radiological report offers in relation to other methods used in the elaboration of radiologic reports were presented.
@highlight The new technological trends leave no doubt that the structured report is an unavoidable reality in the field of medicine.
@highlight Although the structured report presents some disadvantages shortcomings or limitations this cannot be considered immediately for your definitive rejection because structured report is a dynamic and evolutionary method and its improvements happen from the fomentation of these analytical studies.
