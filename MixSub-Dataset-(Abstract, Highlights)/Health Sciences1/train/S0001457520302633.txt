 Since motorcycle taxi drivers often work long hours fatigue would affect their riding abilities impacting crash risks . However there is limited understanding about motorcycle taxi drivers fatigue related crashes . This study investigates self reported fatigue related crashes among motorcycle taxi drivers in Hanoi Vietnam . Results from a survey showed that approximately 16 of the motorcycle taxi drivers reported fatigue related crash involvement . It was also found that nearly 37 of all crashes reported by motorcycle taxi drivers were related to fatigue while riding a motorcycle taxi . Results of the heterogeneity in means random parameter logistic model suggested that working fulltime more delivery trips and overweight conditions were associated with increased likelihoods of fatigue related crash involvement . Hybrid taxi drivers who operate as either traditional or ride hailing taxi drivers at different times and most ride hailing taxi drivers had a reduced likelihood of fatigue related crash involvement when compared to traditional taxi drivers . Overall this study has revealed a significant issue of fatigue related crashes among motorcycle taxi drivers . Immediate interventions via publicity or educational campaigns should be considered by authorities to address this important issue . Ride hailing companies should contribute by sending warnings of excessive riding hours to ride hailing taxi drivers .
