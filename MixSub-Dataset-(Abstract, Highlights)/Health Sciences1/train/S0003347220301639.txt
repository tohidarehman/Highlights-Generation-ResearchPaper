 Captive breeding is a conservation strategy that often results in behavioural changes in animals born and reared in captivity . Culturally transmitted behaviours such as learned vocal signals are particularly prone to the effects of captive breeding because captive animals have limited opportunities to learn these behaviours from wild animals . Changes in learned behaviour could affect the success of reintroduction programmes once captive animals are released into the wild . We tested for vocal divergence of learned calls in Puerto Rican parrots

@highlight Captive breeding can cause changes in cultural behaviours like vocal signals.
@highlight We tested for vocal divergence in captive and wild populations of Puerto Rican parrots.
@highlight We found evidence of vocal divergence in four parrot populations.
@highlight Some parrots translocated between populations adopted new vocal signals.
@highlight Dialects in this species may have resulted from rearing practices in captivity.
