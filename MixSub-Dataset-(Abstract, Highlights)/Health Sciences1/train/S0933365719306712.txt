 Significant progress has been achieved in recent years in the application of artificial intelligence for medical decision support . However many AI based systems often only provide a final prediction to the doctor without an explanation of its underlying decision making process . In scenarios concerning deadly diseases such as breast cancer a doctor adopting an auxiliary prediction is taking big risks as a bad decision can have very harmful consequences for the patient . We propose an auxiliary decision support system that combines ensemble learning with case based reasoning to help doctors improve the accuracy of breast cancer recurrence prediction . The system provides a case based interpretation of its prediction which is easier for doctors to understand helping them assess the reliability of the systems prediction and make their decisions accordingly . Our application and evaluation in a case study focusing on breast cancer recurrence prediction shows that the proposed system not only provides reasonably accurate predictions but is also well received by oncologists .

@highlight This paper proposes a medical diagnosis system combining ensemble learning and CBR.
@highlight Similar cases provide an interpretation of the predictions of ensemble classifiers.
@highlight The interpretability improves doctors trust in and acceptance of the system.
@highlight The system is evaluated in a case study about breast cancer recurrence prediction.
