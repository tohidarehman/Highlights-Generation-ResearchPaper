 Older drivers self awareness of driving ability can prompt self regulatory behaviors and modifications of their everyday driving performance . To date studies have yet to examine how older drivers self awareness of changes in driving ability over time or identify the characteristics of those who can accurately monitor such changes . 64 older drivers were recruited and categorized into four groups based on the correspondence of changes in their perceived and actual driving ability over one year 40 of the participants were accurate in their stable or better driving ability over time 30 did not detect their driving performance had worsened and over estimated their driving ability and the remainder either accurately detected their performance had worsened or under estimated their driving performance . No demographic or clinical factors were associated with older drivers self awareness of changes in driving ability over time except the mental processing and executive functioning measured using the Trail Making Tests Part B showed a marginal effect . Implications for clinical importance are discussed .

@highlight Many older drivers did not detect decline in their driving performance over time.
@highlight Fourteen percent of older drivers under estimated their changes in driving ability.
@highlight Trail Making Test Part B may be associated with drivers level of self awareness.
@highlight Age and gender did not predict drivers awareness of changes in driving ability.
