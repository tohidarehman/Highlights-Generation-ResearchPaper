 Mating with multiple partners is common across animal taxa . Males mate multiply because reproductive success positively correlates with mating success . In contrast multiple mating is expected to increase the direct or indirect benefits accrued by females but not necessarily increase their reproductive success . Cases in which female reproductive success increases with mating success could be due to females acquiring material resources that directly increase reproductive output . Because multiple mating likely increases reproductive success more in males than in females males typically experience greater sexual selection . Consequently males in harem polygynous species where a few males can monopolize access to several females in a population are expected to be under stronger sexual selection than females . We field test these predictions by using the harem polygynous Wellington tree wt

@highlight Male and female Wellington tree wt mate with multiple partners in the wild.
@highlight Females in the present study had at least nine mates.
@highlight Reproductive success of both sexes increased with increased mating success.
@highlight Female oviposition rates increased with increasing mating success.
@highlight Offspring were sired by nonresident males not co occupants of female gallery .
