 Many group living animals use precisely coordinated vocalizations to signal group quality and cohesion . However the timing of these signals depends not only on the precision of signallers which has been studied in detail but also on the geometric location of both signallers and receivers . This is because the timing of notes within signals is affected by the speed of sound and relative location of senders and receivers yet these spatial effects have not been examined experimentally . We studied how spatial separation of signallers affects production of and response to vocal duets in Australian magpie larks

@highlight We studied spatial effects on the efficacy of magpie lark duetting displays.
@highlight We used robotic models to assess the roles of the visual and vocal components.
@highlight The visual component reduced the effect of signallers separation on duet tempo.
@highlight Visual displays also enhanced the perception of quality for duets.
@highlight We suggest that the responses of birds were consistent with a multisensory illusion.
