 In polyandrous species males invest significant resources in producing large and high quality ejaculates . As ejaculates are costly males are expected to modulate their investment in response to social cues associated with the expected level of sperm competition or mating opportunity to anticipate future mating conditions . Another consequence of ejaculate costs is that the increase in ejaculate production may be traded against traits linked to mate acquisition . In such cases the effect of this anticipatory plasticity in ejaculate investment on a male s reproductive success will depend on the balance between postcopulatory benefits and precopulatory costs in the sociosexual context subsequently encountered . Here we used the guppy

@highlight Male guppies upregulate sperm production with high female availability.
@highlight This is traded against courtship with potential consequences for mating success.
@highlight With high female availability the upregulation reduces the risk of sperm depletion.
@highlight With low female availability the upregulation reduces mating success.
@highlight Overall effects are minor suggesting low mismatching costs of sperm plasticity.
