 Personality traits often covary forming behavioural syndromes . Such associations if driven by an underlying proximate mechanism could limit the independent evolution of each behaviour . In contrast a behavioural syndrome may be the result of selection favouring the behavioural correlation under certain ecological circumstances . In this context investigating the stability and the potential drivers of behavioural syndromes is a fundamental step towards understanding how they might shape the evolution of behaviours . We assessed syndrome stability across time in two subpopulations of free ranging juvenile lemon sharks

@highlight Behavioural syndromes were inconsistent between subpopulations and years in sharks.
@highlight The subpopulation with the most predators displayed stronger behavioural syndromes.
@highlight Newborn recruitment was a main driver of the strength of the syndrome across years.
