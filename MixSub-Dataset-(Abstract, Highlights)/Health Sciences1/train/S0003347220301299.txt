 Pattern formation and collective behaviour in animal aggregations is highly complex and occurs across many scales over a wide range of environmental conditions . The patterns found in collective behaviour may be modulated by the environmental habitat in which a group is located . Here we consider whether habitat context influences the collective behaviour of fish schools under threat of predation in a dynamic salt marsh system . By comparing collective responses of wild forage fish prior to and during predator attack across three environmental contexts we examine whether schooling state is influenced by the habitat that fish schools reside in . Our results indicate that habitat context had a much stronger effect on collective state relative to predation . The habitats studied induced changes in the behavioural state of fish schools compared to a free field context which demonstrates an alteration of the collective behaviours performed by the school . This suggests that other ecological factors such as the local environment plays a larger role than predation risk in structuring the spatial and temporal group level patterns found in collective behaviour .

@highlight We examined collective behaviour in schooling Gulf menhaden in natural habitats.
@highlight Habitat context induced changes in collective behavioural state of fish schools.
@highlight Habitat had a greater influence on collective state of fish schools than predation.
