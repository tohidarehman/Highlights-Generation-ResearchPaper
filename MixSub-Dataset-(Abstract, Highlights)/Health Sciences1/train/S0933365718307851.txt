 Minimal path method has been widely recognized as an efficient tool for extracting vascular structures in medical imaging . In a previous paper a method termed minimal path propagation with backtracking was derived to deal with curve like structures such as vessel centerlines . A robust approach termed CMPP is here proposed to extend this work . The proposed method utilizes another minimal path propagation procedure to extract the complete vessel lumen after the centerlines have been found . Moreover a process named local MPP BT is applied to handle structure missing caused by the so called close loop problems . This approach is fast and unsupervised with only one roughly set start point required in the whole process to get the entire vascular structure . A variety of datasets including 2D cardiac angiography 2D retinal images and 3D kidney CT angiography are used for validation . A quantitative evaluation together with a comparison to recently reported methods is performed on retinal images for which a ground truth is available . The proposed method leads to specificity and sensitivity values equal to 0.9750 and 0.6591 . This evaluation is also extended to 3D synthetic vascular datasets and shows that the specificity and sensitivity values are higher than 0.99 . Parameter setting and computation cost are analyzed in this paper .
