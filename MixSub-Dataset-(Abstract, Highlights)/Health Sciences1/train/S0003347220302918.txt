 Consistent interindividual differences in behaviour can influence a range of ecological and evolutionary processes including predation . Variation between individual predators in commonly measured personality traits such as boldness and activity has previously been linked to encounter rates with their prey . Given the strong selection on predators to respond to prey individual predators may also vary consistently in their response to prey in a manner that is specific to the context of predation . By studying wild piscivorous fish pike cichlids

@highlight We studied individual variation in the behaviour of wild pike cichlid predators.
@highlight Predators were repeatedly presented with prey stimuli and no prey controls.
@highlight Individual predators differed consistently in the time spent near prey.
@highlight Variation in the response to prey was not explained by behaviour without prey.
@highlight Typical personality traits fail to predict the risk posed by individual predators.
