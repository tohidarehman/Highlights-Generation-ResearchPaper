 In conditionally automated driving drivers have difficulty taking over control when requested . To address this challenge we aimed to predict drivers takeover performance before the issue of a takeover request by analyzing drivers physiological data and external environment data . We used data sets from two human in the loop experiments wherein drivers engaged in non driving related tasks were requested to take over control from automated driving in various situations . Drivers physiological data included heart rate indices galvanic skin response indices and eye tracking metrics . Driving environment data included scenario type traffic density and TOR lead time . Drivers takeover performance was categorized as good or bad according to their driving behaviors during the transition period and was treated as the ground truth . Using six machine learning methods we found that the random forest classifier performed the best and was able to predict drivers takeover performance when they were engaged in NDRTs with different levels of cognitive load . We recommended 3 s as the optimal time window to predict takeover performance using the random forest classifier with an accuracy of 84.3 and an F1 score of 64.0 . Our findings have implications for the algorithm development of driver state detection and the design of adaptive in vehicle alert systems in conditionally automated driving .
