 Collective decision making is essential for multicellular and self organized society coordination but how this occurs when most of the individuals have limited knowledge of the external environment remains elusive . Using empirical data to inform a neuroscience based firing rate model we found that integration of negative feedback and network dynamics in a honeybee

@highlight Honey bees use a stop signal to reduce waggle dancing for a poor quality food site.
@highlight They come from foragers with no knowledge of the food site reducing cognitive load.
@highlight The negative feedback stop signal also reduces waggle dance pheromone production.
@highlight The feedback dynamics are the same for human brain neurons during decision making.
@highlight Owing to convergent evolution the brain and a beehive collectively operate similarly.
