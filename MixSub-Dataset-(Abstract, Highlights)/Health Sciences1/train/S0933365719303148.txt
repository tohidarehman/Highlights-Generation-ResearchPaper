 Glomeruli are histological structures of the kidney cortex formed by interwoven blood capillaries and are responsible for blood filtration . Glomerular lesions impair kidney filtration capability leading to protein loss and metabolic waste retention . An example of lesion is the glomerular hypercellularity which is characterized by an increase in the number of cell nuclei in different areas of the glomeruli . Glomerular hypercellularity is a frequent lesion present in different kidney diseases . Automatic detection of glomerular hypercellularity would accelerate the screening of scanned histological slides for the lesion enhancing clinical diagnosis . Having this in mind we propose a new approach for classification of hypercellularity in human kidney images . Our proposed method introduces a novel architecture of a convolutional neural network along with a support vector machine achieving near perfect average results on FIOCRUZ data set in a binary classification . Additionally classification of hypercellularity sub lesions was also evaluated considering mesangial endocapilar and both lesions reaching an average accuracy of 82 . Either in binary task or in the multi classification one our proposed method outperformed Xception ResNet50 and InceptionV3 networks as well as a traditional handcrafted based method . To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on deep learning over a data set of glomerular hypercellularity images of human kidney .
