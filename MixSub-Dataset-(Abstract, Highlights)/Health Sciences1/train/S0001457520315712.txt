 A meta analysis was performed to review the potential effects of reversible lanes on traffic safety . A systematic review resulted in ten U.S studies with 155 estimates of safety effects that were selected for inclusion in the analysis . These studies employed either a simple before after comparison or a cross sectional comparison methodology . Study results were extracted by transforming the collision rates and frequencies of these studies into a log odds ratio .

@highlight Collision odds associated with reversible lanes appear to be higher overall for all study effect estimates combined.
@highlight Collision odds were also higher for property damage only collisions injury collisions and peak period collisions.
@highlight Meta regression showed that presence of left turn restrictions delineator correlated with a decrease in crashes.
@highlight Presence of dynamic traffic control and static traffic control were both correlated with an increase in crashes.
@highlight Cross sectional comparative studies also tended to find greater effects than simple before after studies.
