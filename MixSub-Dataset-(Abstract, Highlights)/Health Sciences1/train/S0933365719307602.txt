 Kawasaki disease is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children . Its prompt treatment can effectively lower the risk of severe complications such as coronary aneurysms . However accurately diagnosing KD at its early stage is impracticable given its unknown pathogenesis and lack of pathognomonic features . In this study we investigated data driven approaches by using a cohort of 10 367 patients extracted from electronic health records for early KD assessment . The incompleteness of clinical data presents group based missing patterns associated with different clinical assessment measures . To address this problem we developed a method integrating feature clustering to enable matrix based representation and convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and fusion to explicitly exploit the multi source data structure . Integrating missing data imputation methods with the proposed method demonstrated superior accuracy compared with a number of benchmark methods . The present method shows potential to improve clinical data mining . Our study highlighted the feasible utilization of matrix based feature representation and CNN based feature extraction for incomplete clinical data mining to support medical decision making .
