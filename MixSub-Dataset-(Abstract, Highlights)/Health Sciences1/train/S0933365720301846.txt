 Nowadays the demand for segmenting different types of cells imaged by microscopes is increased tremendously . The requirements for the segmentation accuracy are becoming stricter . Because of the great diversity of cells no traditional methods could segment various types of cells with adequate accuracy . In this paper we aim to propose a generic approach that is capable of segmenting various types of cells robustly and counting the total number of cells accurately . To this end we utilize the gradients of cells instead of intensity for cell segmentation because the gradients are less affected by the global intensity variations . To improve the segmentation accuracy we utilize the Gabor filter to increase the intensity uniformity of the gradient image . To get the optimal segmentation we utilize the slope difference distribution based threshold selection method to segment the Gabor filtered gradient image . At last we propose an area constrained ultimate erosion method to separate the connected cells robustly . Twelve types of cells are used to test the proposed approach in this paper . Experimental results showed that the proposed approach is very promising in meeting the strict accuracy requirements for many applications .
