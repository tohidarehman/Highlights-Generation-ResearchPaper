 Quantifying transgenerational effects of stress is important to predict outcomes of anthropogenic disturbances for wildlife species . Maternal stress can programme physiological and behavioural phenotypes in offspring which may be maladaptive if maternal and offspring environments are mismatched . We investigated effects of a match and mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels in lake sturgeon

@highlight Elevated egg cortisol and high stress caused reduced cortisol response to stressor.
@highlight Stress reactivity differed between two families.
@highlight Specific combinations of egg cortisol and stress influenced swimming activity.
