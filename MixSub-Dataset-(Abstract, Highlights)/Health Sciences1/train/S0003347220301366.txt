 Social interactions among individuals play a central role in behavioural ecology and studying cohesion of monogamous pairs is important to understand their social relationships . Here we tested five hypotheses to investigate patterns of pair cohesion in an obligate monogamous mammal the Eurasian beaver

@highlight Beavers exhibit low pair cohesion with pair members being on average 500
@highlight None
@highlight m apart.
@highlight This may increase territory defence efficiency via enhanced patrolling effort.
@highlight Low pair cohesion may also reduce predation risk and competition for food.
@highlight Low pair cohesion might be caused by the beavers monogamous mating system.
