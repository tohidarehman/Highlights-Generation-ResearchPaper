 The development of reproductive isolation is a crucial step in the speciation process . Premating isolation is often implicated in traditional models of divergence with gene flow but the evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms has been poorly explored in species resulting from hybrid speciation . We investigated the mechanisms of reproductive isolation between two closely related Adriatic pipefish species
