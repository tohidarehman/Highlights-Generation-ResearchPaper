 Behavioural lateralization the asymmetric expression of cognitive functions is reported to enhance key fitness relevant traits such as group coordination multitasking and predator escape . Therefore studies reporting negative effects on lateralization in fish due to environmental stressors such as ocean acidification hypoxia and pollutants are worrisome . However such studies tend to use a detour test and focus on population level measures without validating whether lateralization is consistent within individuals across time . We conducted a multispecies international assessment of the repeatability

@highlight Behavioural lateralization reportedly enhances many fitness relevant traits.
@highlight Thus negative effects of environmental stressors on lateralization are worrisome.
@highlight We develop and propose new statistical analyses to test for lateralization.
@highlight Lateralization in five fish species using a detour test was highly nonrepeatable.
@highlight Potential fitness benefits of lateralization must be tested using validated methods.
