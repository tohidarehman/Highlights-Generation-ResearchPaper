 Toxic or noxious prey often signal their unpalatability through aposematic coloration and the evolution of aposematism has become a model system in evolutionary behaviour . Aposematic colours are not only easily recognized by predators but for many predators aposematism enhances learning and memory retention . In this study we used a visually oriented insectivorous agamid lizard

@highlight We offered different colours of dyed crickets to insectivorous lizards.
@highlight Lizards attacked red crickets less often than green or black ones.
@highlight We then trained new lizards to avoid dyed crickets by adding a distasteful powder.
@highlight Lizards learned after a single exposure not to attack crickets regardless of colour.
@highlight Lizards remembered red crickets better than green crickets up to 60 days.
