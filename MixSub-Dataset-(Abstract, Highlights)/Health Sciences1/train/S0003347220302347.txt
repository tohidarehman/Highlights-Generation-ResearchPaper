 Many animals rely on the integration of senses to interact with their environment . While most studies on multisensory integration focus on animals that use passive sensing fewer studies have investigated actively sensing animals such as animals that use echolocation . Prior work has demonstrated that bats and dolphins have the ability to perceive objects through both echolocation and vision and may integrate information across senses to improve target identification . Less is known however about how these animals might modify their active sensing systems when additional sensory input such as visual cues is available . In this study we examine how Brazilian free tailed bats

@highlight Bats signals had narrower bandwidth and longer duration during daylight vs night.
@highlight Signals had less resolution during the day than during the night.
@highlight Changes in resolution were more pronounced in complex environments.
@highlight These findings suggest bats may supplement echolocation with vision.
