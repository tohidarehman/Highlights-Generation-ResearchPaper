 Determining and understanding the environmental factors contributing to road traffic accident occurrence is of core importance in road safety research . In this study a methodology to obtain robust and unbiased results when modeling imbalanced high resolution accident data is described . Based on a data set covering the whole highway network of Austria in a fine spatial and temporal scale the effects of 48 covariates on accident occurrence are analyzed with a special emphasis on real time weather variables obtained through meteorological re analysis . A balanced bagging approach is employed to cope with the issue of class imbalance . By fitting different tree based classifiers to a large number of bootstrapped training samples ensembles of binary classification models are established . The final prediction is achieved through majority vote across each ensemble resulting in a robust prediction with reduced variance . Findings show the merits of the proposed approach in terms of model quality and robustness of the results consistently displaying accuracies around 80 while exhibiting sensitivities of approximately 50 . In addition to certain features related to roadway geometrics surface condition and traffic volume a number of weather variables are found to be of importance for predicting accident occurrence . The proposed methodological take may not only pave the way for further analyses of high resolution road safety data including real time information but can also be transferred to any other imbalanced classification problem .

@highlight A resampling approach for dealing with severe class imbalance is presented.
@highlight Random forests and boosted trees are used to model accident occurrence.
@highlight Confidence intervals for variable importance are presented.
@highlight The approach is shown to be robust with reduced variance.
@highlight The methodology can be transferred to any imbalanced classification problem.
