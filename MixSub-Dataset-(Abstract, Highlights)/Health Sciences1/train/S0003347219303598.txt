 Polyandry has been a central topic in the study of animal behaviour . Yet it is still not clear how the body weight of each sex affects the probability of female remating and what each sex gains from polyandry . Here we aimed to shed some light on these questions using the Mediterranean flour moth

@highlight Heavier moths of both sexes are of higher fecundity and greater promiscuity.
@highlight Almost all virgin pairs mate regardless of weight to ensure fertilization.
@highlight Probability of polyandry rises when the female and or the second male are heavier.
@highlight Sperm displacement mechanisms allow each sex to gain fitness via polyandry.
@highlight Two sexes play combined roles in occurrence of polyandry depending on their weight.
