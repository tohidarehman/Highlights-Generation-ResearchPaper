 Constructing a nest within a mating territory provides a clear benefit to the resident particularly by improving the opportunity to mate . It is unclear whether animals who use nests exclusively for reproductive purposes account for either the effort invested or the resulting increase in mating potential when valuing their territories . We sought to explicitly reveal a nest s added subjective resource value through within group comparison of aggressive behaviour before and after nest construction . An increase in aggression following construction would indicate that the resident perceives greater subjective value in his territory and thus values the nest . Threespine stickleback

@highlight Resident fish exhibited equivalent levels of aggression before and after nesting.
@highlight Behaviours were robust repeatable and significantly intercorrelated.
@highlight Behavioural measures of territorial aggression were not predictive of nesting outcome.
@highlight Territorial aggression in stickleback may be assayed without regard to nesting cycle.
