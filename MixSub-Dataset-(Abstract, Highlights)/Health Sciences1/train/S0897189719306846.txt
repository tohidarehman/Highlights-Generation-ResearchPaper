 Nursing tasks are changing as the proportion of people over the age of 65years is increasing and is expected to double over the next four decades . New innovative solutions such as Point of Care Treatment are being tested in oncological settings in order to optimise treatment and this changes the nurse management in oncology . There is a need to explore oncology nurses perception and experience when implementing the innovations in order to understand the implications for nursing and the treatment of older patients with cancer . Qualitative research with face to face interviews with nurses working in oncology . Sample size . Data were recorded verbatim transcribed and thematic analysis used . Three themes were identified a A great advantage in nursing b Change of practice in nursing care c Challenges in shifting roles . A majority of the participants had the perception that POCT treatment was an advantage not only for the nursing profession but for the older patients in cancer treatment as well . Monitoring the older patients with cancer at home would prevent them from accessing the hospital and get exposed to viral infections as well as saving them the journey to the hospital . Involvement from relatives clear communication and management of the device and data transferred is essential . The use of POCT in oncology will shift the nurses tasks on the ward as well as improve treatment for older patients with cancer .
