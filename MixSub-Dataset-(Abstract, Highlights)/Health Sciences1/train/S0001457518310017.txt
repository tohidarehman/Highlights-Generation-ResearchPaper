 Elderly people are often considered dangerous drivers due to a decline in visual exploration and cognitive functions . The purpose of this study was to look into 18 young and 12 elderly drivers behaviour . We compared their self assessment of driving as well as their visual and cognitive competencies . Then we assessed their driving competencies and self regulation practices by using different scenarios on a driving simulator . These scenarios were designed to test drivers in situations that were intended to solicit the cognitive competencies identified as problematic for elderly drivers . Results showed that although elderly drivers did not always perform as well as young drivers they could put in place compensatory strategies which may reduce their risk of being injured and future research should explore ways of enhancing those strategies . In particular more should be done in order to strengthen elderlys understanding regarding their driving difficulties and help them set up coping methods with respect to these difficulties .

@highlight Elderly drivers are less likely to change their initial plans to avoid roadworks and thus demonstrate a less flexible behaviour.
@highlight Elderly drivers did not make mistakes when choosing which direction to follow
@highlight Elderly drivers despite perfectly able to manage sudden events when it could be anticipated could be dangerous as soon as these events happened in the periphery of the visual field or couldnt be anticipated
@highlight Elderly drivers were not involved in an accident on the driving simulator
@highlight Elderly drivers can put in place appropriate and effective compensatory strategies
