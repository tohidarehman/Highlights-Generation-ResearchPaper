 In Vietnam motorcycle riders comprise about three quarters of road traffic fatalities the most common cause of which is head injuries that can be prevented by wearing a helmet . This study aims to assess helmet wearing behaviors in Ho Chi Minh City the largest city in Vietnam . Eight rounds of observational studies were conducted in six randomly selected locations between July 2015 and April 2019 . Given the multinomial nature of the outcome measure a multinomial model was developed to estimate the level and trend of helmet use and identify the related individual and environmental factors . A total of 479 892 motorcycle riders were observed over 90 of whom were wearing helmets . However the prevalence of correct helmet use gradually declined from 80.8 in round 155.6 in round 8 . Results from a multinomial model showed the probability of wearing a strapped standard helmet had declined by 22.4 percentage points from round 3 to round 8 while holding other factors constant . The prevalence of correct use is 11.3 percentage points higher for adults than for children . During the same period unstrapped standard helmet use increased by 24.5 percentage points substandard helmet use declined but remained high . The upward trend of incorrect helmet wearing behaviors and wearing substandard helmets sends a rallying call for multisectoral interventions .
