 Infant care is costly and strategies to deal with its energetic demands may involve increasing feeding time or reducing activity levels or social time . In mammals the most energetically expensive form of infant care is lactation followed by infant carrying in species where young are transported over long distances . In titi monkeys infants are carried primarily by males which allows us to tease apart the effects of lactation and infant carrying . We analysed activity budgets and diet composition in adult males and females in seven free ranging groups of red titi monkeys

@highlight Both parents changed their activity patterns and diet composition after infant birth.
@highlight Females fed more ate more arthropods and rested less after infant birth than before.
@highlight Males in contrast fed less ate fewer arthropods and rested more.
@highlight Females fed more at the expense of resting and to a lesser degree social time.
@highlight Despite the decrease in social time females conserved grooming time within pairs.
