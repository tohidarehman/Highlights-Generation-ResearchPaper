 In this work we describe the application of a careflow mining algorithm to detect the most frequent patterns of care in a cohort of 3000 breast cancer patients . The applied method relies on longitudinal data extracted from electronic health records recorded from the first surgical procedure after a breast cancer diagnosis . Careflows are mined from events data recorded for administrative purposes including procedures from ICD9 CM billing codes and chemotherapy treatments . Events data have been pre processed with Topic Modelling to create composite events based on concurrent procedures . The results of the careflow mining algorithm allow the discovery of electronic temporal phenotypes across the studied population . These phenotypes are further characterized on the basis of clinical traits and tumour histopathology as well as in terms of relapses metastasis occurrence and 5 year survival rates . Results are highly significant from a clinical perspective since phenotypes describe well characterized pathology classes and the careflows are well matched with existing clinical guidelines . The analysis thus facilitates deriving real world evidence that can inform clinicians as well as hospital decision makers .

@highlight A data analysis pipeline to extract frequent patterns in breast cancer patients using administrative data from EHR.
@highlight A Topic Modeling step allows synthesizing the ICD9 CM codes of the procedures carried out during hospitalizations.
@highlight Frequent patterns of care are extracted through a careflow mining algorithm.
@highlight The results reveal interesting temporal phenotypes which are different in terms of clinical outcome.
@highlight The resulting careflows reflect the clinical practice guidelines enacted at the considered Breast Unit.
