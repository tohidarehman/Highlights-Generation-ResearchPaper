 Communication plays an integral role in facilitating intra and interspecific interactions . The study of signal function and content reveals the rules that govern such interactions informing hypotheses in behavioural ecology and evolution . The ubiquitous nature of antipredator vocalizations in ground squirrels provides a useful model for studying the evolution of communication . Conspecifics in many ground squirrel species respond to antipredator vocalizations and sociality functions as a strong selective force favouring more informative antipredator vocalizations . However studies of a single antipredator vocalization system in both social and nonsocial contexts are relatively scarce preventing diagnosis of selective forces other than sociality . We conducted a 2 year study to test two alternative hypotheses relating to the function of antipredator vocalizations in a nonhibernating squirrel the Harris antelope squirrel

@highlight Antipredator vocalizations may serve to deter predators and warn offspring.
@highlight A nonhibernating squirrel gives antipredator vocalization throughout the year.
@highlight Squirrels uttering antipredator vocalizations were predominantly female.
@highlight Multiple signal functions may select for increased communication complexity.
