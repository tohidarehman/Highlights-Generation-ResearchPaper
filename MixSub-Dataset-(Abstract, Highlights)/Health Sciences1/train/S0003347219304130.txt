 It has been argued that the influx of women into the fields of primatology and animal behaviour caused a transformation in conventional beliefs particularly with regard to our understanding of malefemale sexual dynamics and the role of females in animal societies . Women members of the Animal Behavior Society have played important roles in challenging the accepted wisdom in our field . Simultaneously at least during the last 40 years women have become an increasingly vibrant force within the ABS including playing significant roles within the leadership of the society . As a result animal behaviour represents a notable exception with regard to gender parity when compared to some other scientific disciplines . This paper examines the synergisms between the influx of women into animal behaviour and novel advances in the field . It also addresses questions debated by feminist scholars regarding the reasons and mechanisms for women s impacts and whether feminism is a factor in disciplinary transformations . Finally it suggests the integration of women in animal behaviour provides a blueprint for inclusion of other groups under represented in the sciences .
