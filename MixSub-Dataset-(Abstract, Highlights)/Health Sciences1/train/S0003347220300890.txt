 This paper examines the context of science scholarship and research careers experienced by behavioural biologists from under represented minority groups during the period starting in the late 1800s until the early decades of the Animal Behavior Society . For much of history white European and American men have dominated the seats of scientific leadership shaping narratives and controlling who asks scientific questions how these questions are examined and what is significant . Yet individuals from URM groups have navigated careers in animal behaviour and related fields and along with some nonminority allied scientists have often simultaneously advocated for diversity and inclusion among our ranks . The lasting impact of these scholar activists has been important not only to the discipline but to science as a whole . This paper shines lights on missing narratives of URMs who were often excluded in academic histories as well as emphasizing the importance of creating more inclusive spaces for future animal behaviour scholars . I highlight the contributions of American scientists in the U.S.A. who have contributed to the development of animal behaviour and related disciplines and have raised awareness about social justice and inclusivity in our field .
