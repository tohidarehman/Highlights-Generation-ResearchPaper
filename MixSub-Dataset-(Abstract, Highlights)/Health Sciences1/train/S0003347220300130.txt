 Disease exposure is a threat to all organisms but there are a number of methods of self defence . First individuals can proactively prevent disease through avoidance behaviours . If they become infected individuals can activate an immune response to control the infection . A trade off between avoidance behaviours and immune response activation has been hypothesized to occur because of costs associated with each strategy . Individuals may balance behavioural and immunological strategies to provide optimal protection against disease . To test this hypothesis in a captive population of zebra finches

@highlight Behavioural and immunological defences against infection may be traded off.
@highlight We found few trade offs between defences and these differed with age and sex.
@highlight Corticosterone exposure induced trade offs between behavioural and immune defences.
@highlight Avoidance behaviour and haptoglobin levels were repeatable in zebra finches.
