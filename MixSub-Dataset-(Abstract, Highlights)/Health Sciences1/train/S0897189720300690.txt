 There is growing evidence that patients with functional decline are at increased risk of readmission mortality and institutionalization . Instruments to measure the status of self care could provide important information for efficient care planning . The widely used Self Care Index serves as an indicator for the severity of nursing dependency . To date no evidence is available on the association of the instrument with rehospitalization mortality and institutionalization . To examine the association of functional status measures with 30 day mortality readmission and institutionalization in hospitalized non surgical patients . Prospective cohort study . We included 4540 emergency medical patients at a single hospital in Switzerland . Primary outcome was 30 day mortality rate secondary outcomes were 30 day readmission and institutionalization . We analyzed the association of the functional status with the binary endpoints using logistic regression models and C statistics for discrimination . All of the examined measures were significant predictors of overall 30 day mortality Self Care Index on admission adj . OR 0.90 Self Care Index at discharge adj . OR 0.86 functional decline adj . OR 1.22 and all Self Care Index single items . A combined model showed a good accuracy with regard to the AUC adj . AUC 0.80 . Several functional measures were associated with 30 day mortality . Self Care Index total score five single items and a combined model showed the best performance .

@highlight The functional status can predict mortality.
@highlight Limitations in certain self care abilities predict mortality better than others.
@highlight Self care abilities do not predict rehabilitation or institutionalization.
