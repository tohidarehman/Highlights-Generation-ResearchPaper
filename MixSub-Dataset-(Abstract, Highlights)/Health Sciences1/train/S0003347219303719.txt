 Behavioural plasticity can be costly but is advantageous when it allows animals to adjust their behaviour to current conditions . Since individual differences in learning ability could be a source of differences in behavioural plasticity the frequency dependence of payoffs within a foraging group may permit the coexistence of both plastic fast learning individuals and nonplastic slow learning individuals in a frequency dependent context the adjustments of a few benefit all . In this study we investigated whether individuals that learned faster in a simple associative learning task were also more likely to adjust their behaviour in a social foraging game context than their slower learning groupmates . We measured the associative learning ability of female Bengalese finches

@highlight We examined learning speed vs behavioural plasticity during foraging in finches.
@highlight Contrary to expectation slow learners were more plastic than fast learners.
@highlight Thus cognitive processes involved in simple and complex tasks may differ.
@highlight Effects of the fastslow continuum on plasticity may differ with social context.
