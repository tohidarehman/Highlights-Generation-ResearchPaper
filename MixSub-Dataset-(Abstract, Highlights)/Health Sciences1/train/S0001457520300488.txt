 Urban planners frequently neglect the role of subjective risk perception during urban cycling . Several findings suggest a complex relationship between the risk of being involved in a crash and the subjective anticipation of this risk . We investigate the relation of objective risks and subjective risk perception in a medium sized German city . Using GIS methods these datasets are linked to various infrastructure and traffic properties that have been found relevant for cycling safety . Despite a generally high alignment of objective and subjective risk our findings highlight that the subjective risk perception at a given location can deviate significantly from the actual crash risk . For example the subjective perception of high risk on one way streets with bikeways in opposing direction is not matched by a high level of objective risk . Vice versa some rather dangerous situations are not perceived as particularly dangerous . Understanding why and where cyclists over or underestimate the actual crash risk may provide a foundation for the design of safer cycling infrastructures as well as for promoting cycling as a comfortable mode of transportation .

@highlight The relation of accident risk and risk perception during cycling is understudied.
@highlight We compared accident statistics with crowd sourced information on risk perception.
@highlight GIS methods are used to link both datasets to various infrastructure elements.
@highlight In general we found a high alignment of objective and subjective risk.
@highlight Some infrastructure elements lead to over or underestimations of accident risks.
