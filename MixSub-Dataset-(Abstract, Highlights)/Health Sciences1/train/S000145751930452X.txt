 This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between the built environment and roadway safety with a focus on studies that analyse small geographical units such as census tracts or travel analysis zones . We review different types of built environment measures to analyse if there are consistent relationships between such measures and crash frequency finding that for many built environment variables there are mixed or contradictory correlations . We turn to the treatment of exposure because built environment measures are often used either explicitly or implicitly as measures of exposure . We find that because exposure is often not adequately controlled for correlations between built environment features and crash rates could be due to either higher levels of exposure or higher rates of crash risk per unit of exposure . Then we identify various built environment variables as either more related to exposure more related to risk or ambiguous and recommend further targeted research on those variables whose relationship is currently ambiguous .

@highlight Identifies that much of the literature on built environment and crash risk presents mixed or contradictory results.
@highlight Recommends that future research explicitly link each built environment variable conceptually with either risk or exposure.
@highlight Identifies the likely linkage of different built environment variables with either risk or exposure.
@highlight Identifies specific built environment variables that require further research attention to reveal their effect on crash risk.
@highlight Recommends that future research where possible investigates the same built environment variable across multiple contexts urban suburban and rural.
