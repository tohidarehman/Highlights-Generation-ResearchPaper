 Many species of insects have sex specific and species specific cuticular lipid profiles that help regulate mate recognition and courtship behaviour . However in adult butterflies little is known about cuticular hydrocarbons the main component of the lipid profile and their function in mating . Here we investigated whether

@highlight males use cuticular hydrocarbons CHCs for mate discrimination.
@highlight The CHCs of males and heterospecific females suppress male copulation attempts.
@highlight Certain cuticular alkenes serve as behavioural inhibitors of male copulation.
