 Overtaking cyclists is challenging for drivers because it requires a well timed safe interaction between the driver the cyclist and the oncoming traffic . Previous research has investigated this manoeuvre in different experimental environments including naturalistic driving naturalistic cycling and simulator studies . These studies highlight the significance of oncoming trafficbut did not extensively examine the influence of the cyclists position within the lane .

@highlight 18 drivers overtook a robot cyclist on a test track with an oncoming robot vehicle.
@highlight We varied time gap to the oncoming traffic and position of cyclist within the lane.
@highlight Safety margins to the cyclist decreased as the situation became more critical.
@highlight Drivers risk compensation may explain safety margins during the whole manoeuvre.
@highlight We created Bayesian models that may improve acceptance of active safety systems.
