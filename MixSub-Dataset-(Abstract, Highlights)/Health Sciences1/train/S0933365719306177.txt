 Cancer is the second leading cause of death after cardiovascular diseases . Out of all types of cancer brain cancer has the lowest survival rate . Brain tumors can have different types depending on their shape texture and location . Proper diagnosis of the tumor type enables the doctor to make the correct treatment choice and help save the patient s life . There is a high need in the Artificial Intelligence field for a Computer Assisted Diagnosis system to assist doctors and radiologists with the diagnosis and classification of tumors . Over recent years deep learning has shown an optimistic performance in computer vision systems . In this paper we propose an enhanced approach for classifying brain tumor types using Residual Networks . We evaluate the proposed model on a benchmark dataset containing 3064 MRI images of 3 brain tumor types . We have achieved the highest accuracy of 99 outperforming the other previous work on the same dataset .

@highlight We propose an enhanced deep learning approach for classifying brain tumor types from MRI images.
@highlight Approach is using a benchmark dataset and has managed to achieve 99 accuracy which is state of the art result and higher than all previous work.
@highlight Beside accuracy we are using other metrics for evaluation such as precision recall f1 score and balanced accuracy to obtain accurate results against the imbalanced dataset.
