 The pace of life syndrome hypothesis posits that personality traits are linked to life history and fitness . Specifically fast paced individuals are predicted to be proactive with an earlier age at first reproduction a shorter life span and higher fecundity than slow paced individuals . Environmental conditions and sex differences may be important in maintaining behavioural and life history variation in populations and may influence the covariance of personality with life history or lifetime fitness . However these effects are rarely tested together . We investigated whether the occurrence of a resource pulse during adulthood altered the associations between personality and life history traits or lifetime offspring production in adult North American red squirrels

@highlight We found no evidence of an association between personality and life history.
@highlight Aggression was associated with higher lifetime fitness in females.
@highlight In males the association between fitness and personality was context specific.
