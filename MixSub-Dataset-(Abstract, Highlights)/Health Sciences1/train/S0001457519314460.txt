 Estimation of ones own crossing time is an important process in making road crossing decisions . This study evaluated the pedestrians ability to estimate crossing time in a field experiment . The estimated crossing time was measured by an interval production method and an imagined crossing method . The results showed that while young pedestrians generally had an accurate estimation of their crossing time old pedestrians consistently underestimated the crossing time in both methods especially at a wider road . Whats worse even fast walking can not compensate for the large underestimation . Further analysis showed that although old pedestrians had the declined motor imagery ability and the worse general timing accuracy none of them can account for the inaccuracy of estimation . These findings suggest that underestimation of crossing time may be one of the important reasons for the acknowledged risky road crossing decision making in old pedestrians . It also calls for studies on assistive roadway designs and intervention programs targeting old pedestrians .

@highlight Young pedestrians estimated crossing time accurately.
@highlight Old pedestrians underestimated their crossing time.
@highlight Fast walking cannot compensate for old pedestrians large underestimation.
@highlight Declined motor imagery ability cannot account for old pedestrians underestimation.
@highlight General timing accuracy also cannot account for old pedestrians underestimation.
