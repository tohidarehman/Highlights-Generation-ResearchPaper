 More than 1500 U.S. law enforcement personnel fatalities occurred from 2007 to 2016 with 39 of these related to automobile crashes . This study looked at various types of lighting on police vehicles to determine if changes made to the visibility of a police vehicle can impact the surrounding traffic behavior and increase safety for both law enforcement and the general public . Unmarked and marked police vehicles were positioned behind a civilian vehicle on the shoulder of five different multi lane highways in Virginia simulating a routine traffic stop . The data collected indicated that more lighting and the use of red in a light bar impact traffic behavior in terms of merging and speed when passing a police vehicle . The benefits may be attributed to the symbolic influence of red as denoting a different type of emergency than a traffic stop in addition to reds chromatic contrast against the blue sky during the daytime .

@highlight Observational data indicates that 95 of drivers observe the Move Over law in Virginia.
@highlight The lighting configuration of a police vehicle impacts when drivers merge and how they adjust their speed.
@highlight Red plus blue was shown to be beneficial for merge behavior and speed over an all blue light bar.
@highlight Speed behavior is difficult to assess as independent speed adjustments can be dependent on clusters on high speed roadways.
