 Real time crash risk prediction is expected to play a crucial role in preventing traffic accidents . However most existing studies only focus on freeways rather than urban arterials . This paper proposes a real time crash risk prediction model on arterials using a long short term memory convolutional neural network . This model can explicitly learn from the various features such as traffic flow characteristics signal timing and weather conditions . Specifically LSTM captures the long term dependency while CNN extracts the time invariant features . The synthetic minority over sampling technique is used for resampling the training dataset . Five common models are developed to compare the results with the proposed model such as the XGBoost Bayesian Logistics Regression LSTM etc . Experiments suggest that the proposed model outperforms others in terms of Area Under the Curve value sensitivity and false alarm rate . The findings of this paper indicate the promising performance of using LSTM CNN to predict real time crash risk on arterials .

@highlight A LSTM Convolutional Neural Network LSTM CNN network is proposed to predict crash risk in real time on arterials.
@highlight The possibilities of using various data sources for real time crash prediction are explored. Such as Bluetooth data detector data and weather data. One years data are analyzed extensively. Different data preparation techniques are used.
@highlight Synthetic minority over sampling technique SMOTE is utilized for re sampling the extremely imbalanced crash dataset.
@highlight The performance of LSTM CNN is compared with other common approaches on the same dataset. Results suggest that the LSTM CNN outperforms the others with various evaluation metrics i.e. Area Under the Curve AUC sensitivity and false alarm rate.
