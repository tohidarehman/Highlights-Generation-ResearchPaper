 Migration theory has largely overlooked the role of overwintering grounds and yet many migratory animals spend most of the annual cycle there . High winter site familiarity could confer considerable advantages on animals preparing for subsequent migration phases enabling them to maximize migration speed and minimise the use of unknown stopover sites . Despite this quantitative studies of the magnitude of fuel stores attained at such sites are lacking . To evaluate the energetic contribution of an overwintering site to spring migration we used manual and automated telemetry to estimate departure date departure fuel load flight range and breeding destination of blackpoll warblers

@highlight Optimal migration theory has largely overlooked the function of wintering sites.
@highlight Extensive fuelling at such sites could maximize migration speed and reduce risk.
@highlight Blackpoll warblers stored enough energy at a tropical wintering site to fly 2710

@highlight Mean flight range was equivalent to 50 of the total migratory journey.
@highlight Wintering sites can have an intrinsic role in shaping migratory strategies.
