 To quantify the type and duration of physical activity performed by hospitalized adults . Inactivity is pervasive among hospitalized patients and is associated with increased mortality functional decline and cognitive impairment . Objective measurement of activity is necessary to examine associations with clinical outcomes and quantify optimal inpatient mobility interventions . We used PRISMA guidelines to search three databases in December 2017 to retrieve original research evaluating activity type and duration among adult acute care inpatients . We abstracted data on inpatient population measurement method monitoring time activity duration and study quality . Thirty eight articles were included in the review and 7 articles were included in the meta analysis . Study populations included geriatric This review provides a baseline assessment and benchmark of inpatient activity which can be used to compare inpatient mobility practices . While there is substantial heterogeneity in how researchers measure and define how much inpatients move there is consistent evidence that patients are mostly inactive and in bed during hospitalization . Future research is needed to establish standardized methods to accurately and consistently measure inpatient mobility over time .
