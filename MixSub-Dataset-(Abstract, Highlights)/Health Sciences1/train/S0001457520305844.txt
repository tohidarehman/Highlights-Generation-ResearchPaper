 Approximately one third of car trips involve one or more passengers and yet we know little about how the presence of a passenger helps or hinders safety and efficiency . To date research in this area has focused on the possible distractive effects of passengers . Although we know that drivers conversing on a mobile phone is distracting and unsafe epidemiological studies suggest that driving with a passenger has a lower crash risk than driving alone . This paper describes two studies into how drivers and passengers interact during a journey a survey regarding the most common actions of passengers and how drivers view their helpfulness and an on road study of driver and passenger interactions . The results indicated several areas that drivers felt passenger assistance was quite helpful but in some cases was exhibited very rarely . The on road study revealed some interesting gender differences in who offers driving support and who requests it . By understanding how passengers can contribute to safer journeys we can provide that information to drivers at risk such as those very early or late in their driving careers .

@highlight Passengers often viewed as distracting but safety data suggests they are protective.
@highlight We conducted a mixed methods study to understand the ways passengers help drivers.
@highlight On line survey indicated some things drivers wished their passengers would do more.
@highlight On road sample found gender differences in the support offered by passengers.
@highlight Promoting the idea of a co driver changes passenger role to an active participant.
