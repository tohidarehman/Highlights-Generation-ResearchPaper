 Song learning is generally assumed to be beneficial for a young songbird but merely incidental without costs or benefits for the older song tutors . In the present study we contrast two mutually exclusive hypotheses about the tutor tutee relationship that it is cooperative or at least mutually tolerant with tutor and tutee mutually benefiting from their relationship versus that it is competitive with tutor and tutee competing over territory so that one or the other suffers negative fitness consequences of their relationship . In a field study of three consecutive cohorts of song sparrows

@highlight Song learning is generally assumed to benefit the tutee but not the tutor.
@highlight We investigate whether song learning is competitive or cooperative.
@highlight We determined from whom a young bird learned most of his songs.
@highlight We then determined how long the tutee and his tutor survived subsequently.
@highlight The more songs a tutee learns from his tutor the longer they both survive.
