 Individuals often vary in their problem solving performance and animal personality may help explain such interindividual variation because it affects how individuals perceive and interact with their environment . Proximate factors provide behavioural mechanisms that also affect problem solving performance . Our aim was to assess the link between personality and problem solving performance in wild caught common brushtail possums

@highlight Personality influenced how well individual possums solved the escape box test.
@highlight Only the most exploratory individuals were likely to solve the difficult task.
@highlight Persistence hindered individuals in the easy task but helped in the difficult task.
@highlight Possums learnt effectively solving tasks faster on their second attempt.
