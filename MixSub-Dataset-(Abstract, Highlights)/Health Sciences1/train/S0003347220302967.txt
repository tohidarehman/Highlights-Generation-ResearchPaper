 Environmental changes caused by urbanization and noise pollution can have profound effects on acoustic communication . Many organisms use higher sound frequencies in urban environments with low frequency noise but the developmental and evolutionary mechanisms underlying these shifts are generally unknown . We used a common garden experiment to ask whether changes in minimum song frequency observed 30 years after a songbird colonized an urban environment are a consequence of behavioural flexibility . We captured male juvenile dark eyed juncos

@highlight Animals in urban environments often produce higher frequency sounds.
@highlight Frequency differences of urban and rural birds persisted in a quiet common garden.
@highlight Higher minimum frequencies of urban birds are not a plastic response to noise.
@highlight Genetic evolution and or early life experiences appear to cause this difference.
@highlight Urban environments may rapidly generate permanent shifts in song frequencies.
