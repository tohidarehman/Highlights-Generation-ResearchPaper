 This paper reports on an exploratory investigation of the influence of five different fatalistic belief constructs on three classes of self reported pedestrian behaviours and on respondents general attitudes to road safety and how relationships between constructs differ across countries . A survey of over 3400 respondents across Bangladesh China Kenya Thailand the UK and Vietnam revealed a similar pattern for most of the relationships assessed in most countries those who reported higher fatalistic beliefs or more external attributions of causality also reported performing riskier pedestrian behaviours and holding more dangerous attitudes to road safety . The strengths of relationships between constructs did however differ by country behaviour type and aspect of fatalism . One particularly notable country difference was that in Bangladesh and to a lesser extent in Kenya a stronger belief in divine influence over ones life was associated with safer attitudes and behaviours whereas where significant relationships existed in the other countries the opposite was true . In some cases the effect of fatalistic beliefs on self reported behaviours was mediated through attitudes in other cases the effect was direct . Results are discussed in terms of the need to consider the effect of locus of control and attributions of causality on attitudes and behaviours and the need to understand the differences between countries therein .

@highlight Questionnaire survey of 3423 respondents across six countries.
@highlight Exploration of beliefs road safety attitudes and pedestrian behaviours.
@highlight Stronger fatalistic beliefs associated with riskier attitudes and behaviours.
@highlight Relationships were dependent on the specific factors of interest.
@highlight Despite many similarities there were also significant between country differences.
