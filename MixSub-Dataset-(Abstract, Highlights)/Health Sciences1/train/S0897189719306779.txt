 PhD prepared nurse scientists within healthcare systems are uniquely positioned to advance nursing science through research and evidence based practice initiatives due to their ability to closely collaborate with nurses and other healthcare professionals in the clinical setting . The purpose of this paper is threefold 1 to describe the roles and contributions of Nurse Scientists from their perspectives in four different health care systems in the Greater Philadelphia area three of which are Magnet designated hospitals 2 to highlight organizational approaches to increase nursing research and EBP capacity and 3 to explore strategies that Nurse Scientists used to overcome barriers to build nursing research capacity . Nurse Scientists employed in these healthcare systems share many of the same essential roles and contributions focused on developing nursing research and EBP initiatives through education and mentorship of clinical nurses conduct and oversight of independent research and dissemination activities . With supportive executive nurse leadership the Nurse Scientists within each healthcare system employed different strategies to overcome barriers in building nursing research and EBP capacity . Nurse scientists within healthcare settings have potentially powerful positions to generate and apply new knowledge to guide nursing practice and improve outcomes .

@highlight Nurse scientists within healthcare systems are essential to engage nurses in the research and evidence based practice processes.
