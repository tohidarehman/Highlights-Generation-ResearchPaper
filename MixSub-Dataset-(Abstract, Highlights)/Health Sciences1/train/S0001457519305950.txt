 The effects of low levels of blood alcohol concentration on motorcyclist performance are still not fully comprehended . The great majority of the studies are in fact focused on car driving . So far it is known that even BAC levels below the legal limit negatively affect riding motor skills correlated with crash rate . In the present study we used a moped riding simulator to investigate the effects of low alcohol dosages on the defensive riding ability of light drinkers particularly focusing on the degree of danger characterizing their riding performance . We recruited 24 participants through a double blind random distribution balanced cross over design . We administered moderate amounts of alcohol to participants during two sessions of moped riding simulation . The results showed that even though BAC levels were always below the limit allowed by Italian traffic law alcohol induced a reduction in safe riding behaviors as indicated by the greater amount of hazardous scenes faced with dangerous riding behaviors when participants were under the influence of alcohol than when they were sober . Moreover low BAC levels had a greater detrimental influence when a certain amount of learning had already been achieved by the participants . The results suggest that the effect of a low dose of alcohol interacts with participants self confidence .

@highlight Alcohol is more frequently involved in fatal crashes of motorcyclists than car drivers.
@highlight In most countries legal BAC limits are the same for motorcyclists and car drivers.
@highlight We recorded moped riding simulated behaviors under placebo alcohol administration conditions.
@highlight The results show an increase of danger in facing hazards under low doses of alcohol.
@highlight Conclusions support governmental decisions to set legal BAC limits at low levels.
