 We systematically reviewed the quality of sleep measurement instruments applied to shift work nurses and analyzed the effects of intervention research . There is a need to test the effects of experimental studies worldwide that conducted interventions to improve the sleep quality of nurses who work shiftwork . In this systematic literature review and meta analysis we used PICO and searched for papers in Korean and English published up until August 2018 . We utilized Cochrane Review Manager Software 5.3 . Thirteen articles from 1991 to 2018 were included in the systematic literature review and 6 of those were used in a meta analysis . The instrument used most often to asses subjective sleep quality was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index . Additionally an actigraph and sleep logs were used to collect physiological data about participants sleep quality . Intervention types were categorized into aroma inhalation therapy shift rotation interventions physical activity interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy . Ultimately the effects of the aroma inhalation therapy intervention significantly improved shift work nurses sleep quality . We established a basic understanding of a strategy to measure and improve participants sleep quality . Consequently sleep interventions that can positively promote nurses health and foster effective job performance should be developed .
