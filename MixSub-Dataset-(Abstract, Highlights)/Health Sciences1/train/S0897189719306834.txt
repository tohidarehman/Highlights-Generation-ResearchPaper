 Clinical inquiry is vital to safeguard nursing practice and ensure optimal outcomes for our patients and families . The innovative Nursing Science Fellowship was developed to provide structured mentorship for pediatric nurses by nurse scientists to design and conduct clinical inquiry generated from their practice . Each fellow is paired with a nurse scientist mentor to receive support for timely project completion . Dedicated mentors guide the immersion of fellows in nursing science by providing them with didactic content detailing the process of clinical inquiry and bi monthly one on one mentorship sessions . Throughout their journey fellows learn the appropriate method by which to address their clinical inquiry question and complete a scholarly project that contributes to the science of nursing . On a quarterly basis fellows share their progress and achievements with peers mentors and senior leadership . Since 2011 84 fellows have enrolled in this two year program . Sixty two nurses have graduated from the NSF and 22 fellows are currently active . Collectively the fellows have received 46 grants to support their projects . Twenty one fellows have received promotions and 22 fellows have furthered their education in a masters clinical or research doctorate program . There have been 78 external disseminations highlighting their clinical inquiry work including poster and podium presentations and peer reviewed published manuscripts . Lastly there have been 26 new or updated clinical practices implemented across the enterprise as a result of completed projects . Combined these efforts have ensured a sustained commitment to advancing the science and practice of pediatric nursing .
