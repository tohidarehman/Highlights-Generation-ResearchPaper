 This paper investigates truck involved crashes to determine the statistically significant factors that contribute to injury severity under different weather conditions . The analysis uses crash data from the state of Ohio between 2011 and 2015 available from the Highway Safety Information System . To determine if weather conditions should be considered separately for truck safety analyses parameter transferability tests are conducted the results suggest that weather conditions should be modeled separately with a high level of statistical confidence . To this end three separate mixed logit models are estimated for three different weather conditions normal rain and snow . The estimated models identify a variety of statistically significant factors influencing the injury severity . Different weather conditions are found to have different contributing effects on injury severity in truck involved crashes . Rural rear end and sideswipe crash parameters were found to have significantly different levels of impact on injury severity . Based on the findings of this study several countermeasures are suggested 1 safety and enforcement programs should focus on female truck drivers 2 a variable speed limit sign should be used to lower speeds of trucks during rainy condition and 3 trucks should be restricted or prohibited on non interstates during rainy and snowy conditions . These countermeasures could reduce the number and severity of truck involved crashes under different weather conditions .

@highlight Truck driver injury severity is analyzed for three weather conditions.
@highlight Parameter transferability tests suggest that separate models should be used.
@highlight Mixed logit models are estimated to identify significant contributing factors.
@highlight A good number of contributing factors are uniquely associated to weather condition.
