 Road user behaviour and personality traits are important determinants of driver crash risk . While a great deal of research has been undertaken to understand the relationships between crash involvement behaviours and personality traits for motor vehicle drivers comparatively few studies have considered these factors for cyclists . This manuscript presents the findings of a study conducted amongst a sample of six hundred and fifteen Australian cyclists investigating these issues .

@highlight Cyclists infrequently engaged in aberrant behaviours.
@highlight Aberrant behaviours decreased with age and cycling frequency.
@highlight Extroversion was associated with errors and violations.
