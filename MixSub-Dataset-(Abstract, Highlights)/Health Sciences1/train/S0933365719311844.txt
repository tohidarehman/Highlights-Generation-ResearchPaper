 Temporal phenotyping enables clinicians to better understand observable characteristics of a disease as it progresses . Modelling disease progression that captures interactions between phenotypes is inherently challenging . Temporal models that capture change in disease over time can identify the key features that characterize disease subtypes that underpin these trajectories . These models will enable clinicians to identify early warning signs of progression in specific sub types and therefore to make informed decisions tailored to individual patients . In this paper we explore two approaches to building temporal phenotypes based on the topology of data topological data analysis and pseudo time series . Using type 2 diabetes data we show that the topological data analysis approach is able to identify disease trajectories and that pseudo time series can infer a state space model characterized by transitions between hidden states that represent distinct temporal phenotypes . Both approaches highlight lipid profiles as key factors in distinguishing the phenotypes .
