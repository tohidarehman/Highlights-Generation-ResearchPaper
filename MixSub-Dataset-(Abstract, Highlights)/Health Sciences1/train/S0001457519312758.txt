 In this study we test the widely held belief that young workers are less likely than adults to speak up about safety concerns . Counter to this belief and in line with age related resource selectivity theory we hypothesized that older workers would actually be less likely than younger workers to speak up about workplace safety concerns when their supervisors are unclear about their own commitment to safety . To test this we created two realistic scenarios in which we manipulated clarity of supervisor commitment to safety it is clear the supervisor clearly cares about is open to hearing suggestions about safety and it is unclear whether the supervisor cares about is open to hearing suggestions about safety . We randomly assigned participants

@highlight We test the belief that young workers are less likely than adult workers to speak up about safety concerns.
@highlight Under clear supervisor commitment to safety younger and adult workers did not differ on their safety voice intentions.
@highlight Under unclear supervisor commitment to safety adult workers were less likely to speak up about safety compared to younger workers.
@highlight These findings have implications for our understanding of young and adult worker safety voice.
@highlight These findings also highlight the importance of how supervisors signal commitment to safety.
