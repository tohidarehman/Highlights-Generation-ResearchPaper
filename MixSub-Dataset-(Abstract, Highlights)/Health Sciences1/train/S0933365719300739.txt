 Globally methods of controlling blood pressure in hypertension patients remain inefficient . The difficulty of prescribing appropriate drugs specific to a patients clinical features serves as one of the most important factors . Characterizing the critical drug related features just like that of the antibacterial spectrum may help a doctor easily prescribe appropriate drugs by matching a patients attributes with drug related features and effectiveness of the selected drugs would also be ascertained . In this study we aimed to apply data mining methods to obtain the clinical characteristics spectrum or important clinical features of five frequently used drugs for hypertension control by comparing successful and unsuccessful cases . Spectrum analysis based on a statistical method and five algorithms based on machine learning were used to extract the critical clinical features . A visualized relative weight matrix was then achieved by combining the results from the characteristic spectrum and machine learning based methods . Our results indicated that the five targeted antihypertension agents had different importance orders of the 15 relative clinical features . Clinical analysis showed that the extracted important clinical attributes of the five drugs were both reasonable and meaningful in the selection of hypertension treatment . Therefore our study provided a data driven reference for the personalization of clinical antihypertensive drugs .
