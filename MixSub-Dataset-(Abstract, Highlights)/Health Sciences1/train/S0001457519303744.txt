 This paper analyzes the relationship between road traffic accidents and real economic activity in Spain using data on accidents fatalities and injuries from January 1975 to December 2016 . Our results show the historical asymmetric cyclical behavior of traffic accidents variables . This relationship is more evident for accidents and injuries while fatalities have shown a different pattern since 2002 . Besides using aggregate data we have analyzed urban and nonurban accidents separately . We analyze the effect of economic variables public policy interventions and other potential factors affecting traffic series . Regarding policy interventions we confirm a permanent reduction in all accident rates associated with the mandatory use of seatbelts on car passengers since 1992 . However the penalty points system introduced in July 2006 has only had temporary effects . We have also shown the effect of economic variables such as Industrial Production Index gasoline and diesel consumption and registration of new vehicles and as a novelty the benefits of using the composite coincident and leading indicators of the Spanish economy .
