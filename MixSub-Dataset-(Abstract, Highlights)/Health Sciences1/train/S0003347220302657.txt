 Conspicuous colours in animals are usually explained by mate attraction predator avoidance and prey attraction . Predators may lure prey by mimicking food or other resources . Alternatively some animals avoid predation by visually signalling unpalatability to predators . The evolution of a signal is affected by receiver processing mechanisms . Therefore variation in sensory systems may explain the evolution of colour polymorphism of conspicuous species . We aimed to investigate the role of receivers in the evolution and maintenance of colour conspicuousness and polymorphism in

@highlight We tested whether orb web spider colour morphs attract prey or deter predators.
@highlight There was no difference in foraging success of models red yellow black none .
@highlight Black models bore more attack marks than red and yellow models.
@highlight Conspicuous coloration is possibly a warning signal in
