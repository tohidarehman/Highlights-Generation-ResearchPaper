 Benchmarking performance monitoring progress and then recalibrating interventions is widely recognized as a valuable process for achieving continuous improvement in road safety . In this study a systematic and effective methodology IV VIKOR with FNBC is developed to perform the benchmarking of road safety development in an integrative manner for OECD countries . Linking to other methods and measures as the references 36 OECD Member countries are ranked and grouped into several classes based on their overall achievement regarding road safety from the past decade . This provides government officials and policymakers across the OECD Member countries with a flexible tool to comprehensively benchmark road safety development . Providing the ability to identify delays in action plan implementations and proactively redistribute resources toward more effective measures where required . Such a tool can also serve to increase political will and stakeholder accountabilities at the highest level of government and the private sector for all OECD members Thereby keeping the implementation of action plans on schedule . It helps OECD Member countries to establish the capacity for sustainable safety management supporting them in developing future strategies and reforms to create better policies for better lives .
