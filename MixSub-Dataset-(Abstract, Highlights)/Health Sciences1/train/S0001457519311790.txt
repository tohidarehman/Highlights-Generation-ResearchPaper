 Detecting traffic accidents as rapidly as possible is essential for traffic safety . In this study we use eXtreme Gradient Boosting a Machine Learning techniqueto detect the occurrence of accidents using a set of real time data comprised of traffic network demographic land use and weather features . The data used from the Chicago metropolitan expressways was collected between December 2016 and December 2017 and it includes 244 traffic accidents and 6073 non accident cases . In addition SHAP is employed to interpret the results and analyze the importance of individual features . The results show that XGBoost can detect accidents robustly with an accuracy detection rate and a false alarm rate of 99 79 and 0.16 respectively . Several traffic related features especially difference of speed between 5 min before and 5 min after an accident are found to have relatively more impact on the occurrence of accidents . Furthermore a feature dependency analysis is conducted for three pairs of features . First average daily traffic and speed after accidents non accidents time at the upstream location are interpreted jointly . Then distance to Central Business District and residential density are analyzed . Finally speed after accidents non accidents time at upstream location and speed after accidents non accidents time at downstream location are evaluated with respect to the models output .

@highlight Develop an XGBoost model to detect accidents with detection rate of 79 and AUC of 89 .
@highlight The developed model is robust and interpretable thanks to SHAP.
@highlight Complex interrelated impacts of selected features are captured and analyzed.
