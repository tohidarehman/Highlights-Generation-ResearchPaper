 Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents have become a standard anemia management tool for End Stage Renal Disease patients . However dose optimization constitutes an extremely challenging task due to huge inter and intra patient variability in the responses to ESA administration . Current data based approaches to anemia control focus on learning accurate hemoglobin prediction models which can be later utilized for testing competing treatment choices and choosing the optimal one . These methods despite being proven effective in practice present several shortcomings which this paper intends to tackle . Namely they are limited to a small cohort of patients and even then they fail to provide suggestions when some strict requirements are not met . Here recurrent neural networks are used to model whole patient histories providing predictions at every time step since the very first day . Furthermore an unprecedented amount of data was used to train it thus allowing it to generalize for every single patient . The resulting model outperforms state of the art Hemoglobin prediction providing excellent results even when tested on a prospective dataset . Simultaneously it allows to bring the benefits of algorithmic anemia control to a very large group of patients .

@highlight A model for hemoglobin prediction based on recurrent neural networks is proposed.
@highlight It can model whole patient histories providing predictions at every time step.
@highlight Trained on 110 000 patients from 12 different countries taking various medications.
@highlight The results show an improvement in accuracy over state of the art anemia prediction.
@highlight It brings the benefits of algorithmic anemia control to a large cohort of patients.
