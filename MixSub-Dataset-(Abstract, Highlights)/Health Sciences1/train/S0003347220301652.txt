 Studies on the strategic rules used by fighting animals usually attempt to categorize fights as falling into one of two discrete types self assessment and mutual assessment . With self assessment losers give up when they cross an individual costs threshold without reference to the fighting ability of their opponent while in mutual assessment losers compare their own RHP to that of their opponent and give up if and when they determine themselves to be the weaker rival . However it has recently been suggested that this discontinuous view of variation in assessment strategy might be an oversimplification . This is because use of information on self RHP opponent RHP and resource value is likely to show continuous variation across individuals populations and species . While the possibility of this continuous variation is often ignored we suggest that we can gain a better understanding of decision making during fights by considering the relative contributions of these three information sources to the giving up decisions of losers . Here we use ternary plots to demonstrate how the relative contribution of self RHP opponent RHP and resource value to decision rules can be illustrated using simulated and real contest data as an aid to achieving greater depth in discussions of variation in assessment rules .

@highlight Animal contests are typically classified into distinct categories.
@highlight These categories represent scenarios that have been explored in contest theory.
@highlight Models are based on assumptions about how losers decide to give up.
@highlight Losers might also use information in ways that have yet to be modelled.
@highlight We demonstrate a means of illustrating continuous variation in contest strategies.
