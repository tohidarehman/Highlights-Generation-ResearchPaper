 Pedestrian crossings are sites in which vehicles and pedestrians can crash into each other and are very important in terms of urban traffic . Drivers and pedestrians are more likely to violate traffic regulations and thus adversely affect traffic safety and flow in streets that have many such crossings . Careful planning of pedestrian crossing locations provides a solution to these problems . In this study a corridor based analysis of such sites is performed . Twenty four criteria that are considered to affect pedestrian crossing locations and traffic flow aredetermined . Based on these criteria the most suitable pedestrian crossing scenario is identified using Geographical Information Systems . The Analytic Hierarchy Process and VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje from Multi Criteria Decision Analysis methods are used to evaluate the pedestrian crossing locations and PTV VISSIM is used to examine the impact of these sites on traffic . The proposed method is then applied to a case study of Erzurum Turkey that involves determining the best pedestrian crossing scenario . The results show that the most suitable scenario is S.2 . In terms of the evaluation criteria this alternative scenario provides an improvement of up to 50 over the current situation . Finally a sensitivity analysis is performed to reveal the effect of changing the criteria weights on the evaluation process .

@highlight The performance of pedestrian crossing locations is evaluated.
@highlight A GIS and microsimulation based multi criteria decision analysis approach is applied.
@highlight A hybrid AHP and VIKOR approach model is proposed.
@highlight 11 geographic related and 13 traffic related criteria are considered.
@highlight Results show that proposed scenarios are better than current situation.
