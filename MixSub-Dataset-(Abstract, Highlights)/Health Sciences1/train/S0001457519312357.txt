 Although only 2 of crashes are head on crashes in the United States they account for over 10 of all crash related fatalities . This study aims to investigate the contributing factors that affect the injury severity of head on crashes and develop appropriate countermeasures . Due to the unobserved heterogeneity inherent in the crash data a latent class clustering analysis is firstly conducted to segment the head on crashes into relatively homogeneous clusters . Then mixed logit models are developed to further explore the unobserved heterogeneity within each cluster . Analyses are performed based on the data collected from the Highway Safety Information System from 2005 to 2013 in North Carolina . The estimated parameters and associated marginal effects are combined to interpret significant variables of the developed models . The proposed method is able to uncover the heterogeneity within the whole dataset and the homogeneous clusters . Results of this research can provide more reliable and insightful information to engineers and policy makers regarding the contributing factors to head on crashes .
