 Theory suggests that the balance between unknown dangers and novel opportunities drives the evolution of species level neophobia . Juveniles show lower neophobia than adults within mammals and birds presumably to help minimize the costs of avoiding beneficial novelty and adults tend to be more neophobic to reduce risks and focus on known stimuli . How these dynamics function in island species with fewer dangers from predators and toxic prey is not well understood . Yet predicting neophobia levels at different age classes may be highly valuable in conservation contexts such as species translocation programmes where responses to novelty can influence the effectiveness of prerelease training and animals survival postrelease . To better understand how neophobia and its age related patterns are expressed in an island corvid we surveyed object neophobia in 84 of the world s critically endangered alal

@highlight Neophobia differs by species and is often lower in young birds mammals than adults.
@highlight Predicting neophobia levels is hard but can inform natural history and conservation.
@highlight We measured object neophobia across the majority of an endangered crow species.
@highlight All crows were neophobic but juveniles were much more neophobic than adults.
@highlight We discuss the reversed age effect in relation to neophobia theory and conservation.
