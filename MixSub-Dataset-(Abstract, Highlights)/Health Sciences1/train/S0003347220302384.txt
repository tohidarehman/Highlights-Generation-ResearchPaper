 Brood parasitic cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other birds and thereafter abandon their young to the care of the host . Thus all maternal investment is restricted to investment in the egg . Optimal investment at this stage is likely to have a large impact on maternal reproductive success . Many bird species optimize the size of their eggs to suit both the prevailing environmental conditions and the number of individuals that will provide care to the chicks . However relatively few cues are available to avian brood parasites to facilitate optimal investment in their eggs . Moreover optimization of egg size to suit environmental conditions or the social structure of the host group may be constrained by stronger selection for egg mimicry which reduces the likelihood of detection and rejection of foreign eggs by the host . We aimed to test how the conflicting selection pressures of selection for large eggs in harsh environmental conditions versus rejection of large eggs by hosts interact to influence the size and shape of Horsfield s bronze cuckoo

@highlight Female brood parasitic cuckoos invest only in the egg.
@highlight Selection pressures of host rejection and environment on egg size conflict.
@highlight Sliding window approach was used to investigate periods of climate sensitivity.
@highlight Host defences are the overriding selection pressure on cuckoo egg morphology.
@highlight Hosts use adult cuckoo presence and cuckoo egg shape to detect parasitism.
