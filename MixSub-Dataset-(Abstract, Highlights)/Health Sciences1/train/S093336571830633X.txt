 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide . Early detection of lung cancer is helpful to provide the best possible clinical treatment for patients . Due to the limited number of radiologist and the huge number of chest x ray radiographs available for observation a computer aided detection scheme should be developed to assist radiologists in decision making . While deep learning showed state of the art performance in several computer vision applications it has not been used for lung nodule detection on CXR . In this paper a deep learning based lung nodule detection method was proposed . We employed patch based multi resolution convolutional networks to extract the features and employed four different fusion methods for classification . The proposed method shows much better performance and is much more robust than those previously reported researches . For publicly available Japanese Society of Radiological Technology database more than 99 of lung nodules can be detected when the false positives per image was 0.2 . The FAUC and R CPM of the proposed method were 0.982 and 0.987 respectively . The proposed approach has the potential of applications in clinical practice .
