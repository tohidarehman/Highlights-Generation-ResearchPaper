 This interdisciplinary study explores factors that contribute to the perseverance of participants in an organizational no phone use while driving road safety intervention . The study sample comprised 200 employees 96 males from 8 organizations in Israel . Subjects completed a 4 month organizational intervention using a smartphone application that monitored smartphone use operationalized as taps per minute where each tap represents a single instance of contact with the screen . The app also silenced notifications during the intervention stage . Changes over time in tapping while driving behavior were examined through self report questionnaires and objectively through the applications monitoring function . Validated measures were used to examine factors associated with perseverance in the program . Organizational safety climate and gender were positively related to perseverance in the intervention . Contrary to our hypothesis safety motivation was not found to influence perseverance . The present intervention is most effective for employees with high safety climate perceptions and for male employees . The organizational intervention presented in the current study was shown to be effective in reducing smartphone use while driving . Our findings show that people will download and use an app that actively reduces their incentive to use their phones at the wheel by silencing incoming notifications . The findings support calls to harness the positive potential of information and communications technologies for organizational interventions .
