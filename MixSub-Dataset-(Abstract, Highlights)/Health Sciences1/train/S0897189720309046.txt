 Survey tools such as the Alberta Context Tool reliably measure context but researchers have no process to map context to clinician behaviour and develop strategies to support practice change . Therefore we aimed to map the Alberta Context Tool to the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behaviour Change Wheel . The multi centre study used the Alberta Context Tool to collect data from a convenience sample of nurses working in two emergency departments . These findings were categorised as barriers and enablers and then mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework to examine for behavioural domains . Using the Behaviour Change Wheel functions strategies were developed to target clinician behaviour change . Survey response rate was 42 . Nurses perceived a positive work environment in the dimensions of Social Capital Culture and Leadership . Low scoring dimensions included Formal Interactions Time Staffing and Space . Enablers and barriers were identified in both sites . The Theoretical Domains Framework was mapped to Alberta Context Tool barriers and enablers . The behaviour change strengths included social and professional role beliefs about capability goals and emotions . Using the Behaviour Change Wheel functions 67 strategies were developed to address barriers and enablers . The Alberta Context Tool successfully measured two emergency environments identifying barriers and enablers . This approach enabled environment dimensions to be targeted with practical solutions to support evidence based practice implementation .

@highlight This paper provides a practical method to target environmental work factors to influence clinician behaviour change.
@highlight Mapping of ACT findings to the TDF provided a practical solution to support evidence based practice.
@highlight Behaviour Change Wheel functions enabled targeted solutions to reduce context barriers and strengthen enablers.
