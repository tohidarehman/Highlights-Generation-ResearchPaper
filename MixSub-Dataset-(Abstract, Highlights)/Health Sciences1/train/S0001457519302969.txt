 Driving riding under the influence of alcohol is a major public concern worldwide . Only a few studies have distinguished DUI related variables between motorcyclists and car drivers . This study examined the differences in demographic characteristics and drinking behaviors among first time DUI offenders operating different transportation vehicles and risk factors for frequent DUI among them . We conducted an anonymous survey for 561 first time DUI offenders who attended a mandatory educational program . Participants self administered questionnaires concerning alcohol drinking behaviors and DUI . We defined fDUI as at least two DUI behaviors per month based on self reported information . Demographic and drinking characteristics were compared between DUI offenders car drivers and motorcyclists . Logistic regression analysis was used to examine risk factors for fDUI . Two thirds of first time DUI offenders were motorcyclists . Compared with car drivers motorcyclists were younger and less educated with a higher percentage of them being women and unmarried . Car drivers reported a higher rate of fDUI than motorcyclists . Regression analysis revealed that binge drinkers had a higher fDUI risk in both groups . Regarding the drinking place prior to DUI behavior workplace was significantly associated with fDUI in car drivers . Distinct strategies may be required for motorcyclists and car drivers for DUI recidivism prevention and drinking place interventions should also be considered .
