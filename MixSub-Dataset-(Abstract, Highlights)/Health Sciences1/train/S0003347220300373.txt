 Humans and other animals have been shown to exhibit preferences for options previously associated with greater past need . Such studies indicate that animals are sensitive to both the physical properties of choices and their own state dependent gains at the time of learning . Because this behaviour appears to occur across divergent taxonomic groups it most likely reflects a common way that animals learn about food . Here we study this phenomenon in the frog eating bat

@highlight Properties of prey and state dependent gains of predators may affect learning.
@highlight We tested whether bats nutritional state during learning affects food preferences.
@highlight Bats preferred cues that they learned when they were in a hungry state.
@highlight Reliance on internal state as a cue to food availability is most likely adaptive.
