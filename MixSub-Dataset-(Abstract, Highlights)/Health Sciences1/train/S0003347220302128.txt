 Past threatening experiences such as exposure to a predator or a capture event can influence an animal s future behaviour with profound consequences on its survival and ultimate fitness . We hypothesize that an animal s physiological stress response phenotype modulates the influence of past experiences on future behaviour in the Florida scrub jay

@highlight Threatening experiences can influence future behaviour.
@highlight We tested whether corticosterone CORT responsiveness influenced this relationship.
@highlight After capture low CORT response birds were more neophobic than low CORT controls.
@highlight After capture high CORT response birds were less neophobic than high CORT controls.
@highlight Capture experience may differentially affect neophobia response.
