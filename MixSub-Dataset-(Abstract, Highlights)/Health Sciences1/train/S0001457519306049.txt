 The ALARP principle stating that risks should be reduced to a level As Low As Reasonably Practicable is widely known and discussed in risk management . The principle is flexible as the interpretation of the key concepts of reasonable and practicable can be adapted to different contexts . This paper discusses whether the use of road safety measures on national roads in Norway can be interpreted as an informal application of the ALARP principle . According to official guidelines priority setting for major road investments should be based on cost benefit analysis . Most road safety measures are low cost projects that have traditionally not been subject to cost benefit analysis . A use of these measures regarded as reasonable in the ALARP sense may include considerations of cost efficiency and fair distribution . Data on 328 road safety measures implemented around 2000 is used to evaluate factors influencing their use . It is argued that the use of these measures is consistent with an informal application of the ALARP principle .

@highlight ALARP means as low as reasonably practicable.
@highlight ALARP is used to proritise measures reducing risk.
@highlight Use of road safety measures in Norway is consistent with ALARP.
