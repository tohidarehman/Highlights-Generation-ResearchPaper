 Because females produce and lay eggs or nurture embryos they are constrained in the timing of their investment in reproduction . Males may have more opportunity to concentrate reproductive investment earlier in life mating with as many females as possible soon after becoming adult . This fundamental difference leads to the prediction that because males can bias allocation towards increased reproductive investment early in life they will use up resources earlier in their lives and hence senesce faster than females . A first step towards testing this prediction is to determine whether there are between sex differences in age related changes in behaviour . To do this we recorded the behaviour of crickets

@highlight The sexes differ in reproductive strategies affecting their life histories.
@highlight Life history differences are predicted to influence how individuals decline with age.
@highlight We made minute by minute observations of the behaviour of wild crickets.
@highlight We compare age related changes between the sexes in behaviours both sexes express.
@highlight There are substantial differences between the sexes in how age affects behaviour.
