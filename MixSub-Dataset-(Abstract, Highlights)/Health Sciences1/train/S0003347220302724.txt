 The lateral line system of fishes is composed of neuromast mechanoreceptors that detect movement through vibration and changes in pressure gradients in the water . Although mechanosensory information has been shown to be important in the contexts of predator escape and foraging little is known about the role of the lateral line system during intraspecific interactions such as reproduction . However many species of fish demonstrate complex courtship and aggressive repertoires that involve movement of the body and fins resulting in local displacement of the surrounding water . This displacement has the potential to function as a signal that contains information about the sender . In this study we conducted two behavioural experiments using fathead minnows

@highlight The role of mechanosensory signals in fish communication is not well understood.
@highlight Males without access to mechanosensory information won fewer contests.
@highlight Females without access to mechanosensory signals showed reduced mate discrimination.
@highlight Mechanosensory signals play an important role in social decision making in fish.
