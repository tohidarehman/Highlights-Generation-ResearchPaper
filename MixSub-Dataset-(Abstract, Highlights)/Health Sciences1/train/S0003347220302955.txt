 Bird nests often consist of stronger materials to maintain nest structure and a softer layer of lining materials to reduce heat loss . We studied whether early learning affected the use of nest materials by cross fostering between two tit species with similar breeding ecology the blue tit

@highlight Many more feathers and hairs are found in blue tit than in great tit control nests.
@highlight We cross fostered blue tits and great tits.
@highlight Use of nest material does not seem to be affected by early social learning.
@highlight Females raised by the other species use fewer feathers than controls.
