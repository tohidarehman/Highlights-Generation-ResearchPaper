 In 2011 a more severe drunk driving law was implemented in China which criminalized driving under the influence of alcohol for the first time and increased penalties for drunk driving . The present study aimed to assess effectiveness of the drunk driving law in China in reducing traffic crashes injuries and mortality . Data used in this study was obtained from the Traffic Management Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security of the Peoples Republic of China . An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to analyze annual data from 2004 to 2017 including the number of road traffic crashes deaths and injuries caused by drunk driving in China . The average annual incidences of crashes mortality and injuries have decreased after the promulgation of drunk driving law in 2011 . In the post intervention period the increased slope for crashes mortality and injury rates were respectively 0.140 to 0.006 0.052 to 0.005 and 0.150 to 0.008 indicating a weaker downward trend of dependent variables . The more stringent drunk driving law is not as effective as expected . Drunk driving is still a severe traffic safety problem to be addressed in China . Both legislation and other prevention programs should be adopted to reduce road traffic injuries caused by drunk driving in China .
