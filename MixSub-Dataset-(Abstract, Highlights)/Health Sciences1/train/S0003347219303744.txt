 In many mammalian species males are selected to kill unrelated infants and or fetuses in order to cause lactating and pregnant females to begin cycling sooner than they otherwise would . As a result females have evolved numerous counterstrategies to prevent infanticide and feticide . One such proposed counterstrategy is the Bruce effect an apparently costly strategy in which inseminated or pregnant females cease reproductive investment in a developing embryo or fetus following exposure to nonsire males . Here I present a quantitative model that seeks to explain under what conditions females will be selected to exhibit the Bruce effect rather than risking future infanticide or feticide . I first present an analytical model of the costs of the Bruce effect relative to the costs of potential feticide or infanticide . I then test the resulting predictions using an individual based model operating under ecologically relevant conditions . The individual based model predicts that moderate and high but not low levels of infanticide can produce selection for the Bruce effect . In contrast feticide risk alone is unlikely to lead to selection for the Bruce effect although feticide risk coupled with a substantial risk of female mortality following feticidal attack can . The model correctly predicts the evolution of the Bruce effect in geladas

@highlight The Bruce effect is a purported counterstrategy to infanticide feticide by males.
@highlight High risk of infanticide is sufficient for the Bruce effect to benefit females.
@highlight High risk of feticide and maternal death injury are also sufficient.
@highlight Many species are predicted to exhibit an as yet unreported Bruce effect or feticide.
@highlight More data on fetal loss and or maternal injury following male take over are needed.
