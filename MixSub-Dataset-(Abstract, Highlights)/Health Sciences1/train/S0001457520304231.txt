 This paper investigates factors that significantly contribute to the injury severity of different drivers of different nationality backgrounds . Using the data from Riyadh Saudi Arabia a random parameters multinomial logit model of driver injury severity was estimated to explore the effects of a wide range of variables on driver injury severity outcomes . With three possible outcomes only single vehicle crashes are considered and crashes involving domestic and international drivers were modeled separately . Model estimation results show that a wide range factors significantly affect the injury severity outcomes in single vehicle crashes including driver attributes vehicle characteristics driver actions and other factors and that the influence that these variables have on injury severity probabilities vary considerably between Saudi and non Saudi drivers . While Saudi Arabia is rather unique because of the large numbers of non national drivers the results suggest that different nationalities with their different cultural educational and behavioral backgrounds may affect risk taking behavior and resulting crash injury severities .

@highlight Differences in crash injuries of Saudi and non Saudi drivers are studied.
@highlight Using data from Riyadh random parameters logit models are estimated.
@highlight Model estimations show that determinants of injury severity vary considerably between Saudi and non Saudi drivers.
@highlight Findings show different nationalities may affect risk taking behavior and resulting crash injury severities.
