 Considerable studies have been conducted to investigate the tunnels traffic safety . However the entrance and exit parts of a tunnel are mostly considered symmetrical in previous studies and the different lengths of tunnels have not been separately studied . This study aims to investigate the characteristics of traffic crashes in freeway single tunnels by separately considering the entrance and exit of the tunnel as well as the different lengths of tunnels . A six zone approach is proposed and the data from 156 single tunnels in Hunan province China are applied for safety analysis . The crash rate crash type and contributing crash factors are compared between the conventional four zone approach and the proposed method and the three types of tunnels with different lengths are also compared for in depth analysis .

@highlight A six zone approach is proposed for the safety analysis of freeway single tunnels.
@highlight The crash rate crash type and contributing factors vary for the different zones of the tunnel.
@highlight The crash characteristics vary for the different types of tunnels long medium and short .
@highlight Several countermeasures for improving freeway single tunnel safety are recommended.
