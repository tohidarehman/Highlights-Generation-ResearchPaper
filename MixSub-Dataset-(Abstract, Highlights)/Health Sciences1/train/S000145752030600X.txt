 In Germany every year 66 000 road crashes lead to death or injury of young novice drivers . This makes them twice as likely to be involved in or cause vehicle crashes compared to their older and more experienced counterparts . This study aims to address this societal issue by developing a better understanding of the German young driver problem . For this purpose we created an updated 55 item strong version of the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale originally developed by Scott Parker et al . in 2010 . To make the new version of the BYNDS understandable for German young novice drivers this research used a new method of translation in combination with extensive pre testing . As a result we identified possible threats for response errors such as retrospective formulated questions or double negations . Due the adjustment of the possible sources of error the presented version of the BYNDS is semantically and conceptually different from the original . However due to the application of the updated version of the BYNDS in a robust sample of 700 participants this paper presents the first reliable and validated tool to measure novices risky driving behaviour in Germany . Moreover it offers an updated and extended version of the BYNDS that allows practitioners but also researchers to broaden their understanding of young driver risk .

@highlight The inclusion of sixteen new items creates a timely commensurate BYNDS.
@highlight In particular a broader picture of smartphone use is introduced.
@highlight The paper presents an innovative translation process easy to adopt.
@highlight Pitfalls for response errors are addressed and semantics are improved.
@highlight The questionnaire was applied to a representative German sample of young drivers.
