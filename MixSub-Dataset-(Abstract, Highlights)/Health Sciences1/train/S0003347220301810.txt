 Sexual signals are often elaborate even spectacular behaviours . The reproductive rewards for successful display are great but so are the potential costs . These costs include not only the resources needed to produce a display but also resources required if the display evokes attack from a rival or predator . To maximize payoff individuals must monitor both internal and external cues to adjust display effort . We know surprisingly little about how these competing demands are balanced . Leptin a hormone secreted by adipose tissue regulates energy allocation to functions as diverse as feeding sleep reproduction and immunity . Despite evidence that leptin influences reproductive trade offs its role as a putative regulator of courtship display is poorly understood . Here we examine the use of interoceptive and exteroceptive cues to modulate display effort in Alston s singing mouse

@highlight We examine how energy balance social context affect display effort in singing mice.
@highlight We injected mice with leptin or saline before or after exposure to conspecific song.
@highlight Song effort increased after leptin injection and playback of conspecific song.
@highlight Leptin injection changed song effort in ways consistent with residual body mass.
@highlight While leptin seems to promote increased song effort it also reduced song duration.
