 In environments where females mate multiply males should adjust their behaviour and physiology in response to the perceived level of sperm competition to maximize their fitness . Evidence of such plasticity has been found in several laboratory and field studies but little is known about the cues stimulating these responses in natural populations . One way in which males appear to assess sperm competition risk is through encounter rates with conspecific males . Such encounter rates may be driven by the spatial distribution of resources required by males which in turn affects local density . However explicit links between resource distribution male encounter rates and shifts in behaviour related to sperm competition have not been demonstrated . We found that when group size of

@highlight Perceived sperm competition risk alters male behaviour linked to sexual fitness.
@highlight The cues driving plasticity in the wild have not been well explored.
@highlight We show aggregation of food leads to increased intrasexual encounter rate.
@highlight This in turn stimulates responses likely to affect sperm competition performance.
@highlight Our data help explain how competitive male traits can be influenced in the wild.
