 Individuals of many species utter distress calls when are attacked or trapped by a predator . These vocalizations can help them to escape but may also help conspecifics to reduce their predation risk by inducing antipredator behaviours . Calls can encode information that modulates these antipredator responses and the nonlinearity and fear hypothesis proposes that complex nonlinear calls may trigger more fearful responses because they encode higher levels of stress . We tested this hypothesis with the weeping lizard

@highlight Distress calls with nonlinearity may trigger more fearful responses.
@highlight These responses may be modulated by the scents in the environment.
@highlight We tested these predictions with the weeping lizard 
@highlight Playback experiments showed that calls with nonlinearity were more scary.
@highlight Fear was higher when lizards were with their own scents at home.
