 In group living species particularly cooperative breeders all group members contribute to various behaviours but there is considerable variation between and within individuals in their contributions . While it is well established that there is variation due to differences in the costs and benefits for individuals of different sex age and dominance status shorter term social internal and environmental factors are also likely to be important . Sentinel behaviour where individuals adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates forage offers an opportunity to test hypotheses about context dependent differences in contributions to group behaviour . Here we used field experiments to manipulate the conspecific audience satiation state and perceived danger level of dwarf mongooses

@highlight Sentinel contributions are modified by social internal and environmental factors.
@highlight Changes seen across behavioural levels initial bout bout quantity and within bouts.
@highlight Simulated close audience decreased sentinel contributions.
@highlight Supplementary feeding and alarm call playback increased sentinel contributions.
@highlight Attentiveness of a sentinel can change with differing context.
