 Temporary associations with conspecifics provide critical opportunities for the acquisition and development of socioecological skills especially in species where these interaction opportunities are not readily available . In fact social interactions can have far reaching consequences for the cultural and communicative repertoire on both the species and population level . However to what extent interaction rates are linked to association patterns which depend on individual and ecological factors is often overlooked . Here we examined the sources of variation in immatures social behaviour in relation to both activity and partner type in one Sumatran and one Bornean population of wild orang utans

@highlight We examined social interactions in infant orang utans of two wild populations.
@highlight Analyses focused on three specific social activities with different partners.
@highlight Study site and presence of specific associates affected interaction rates.
@highlight Population differences in interaction time mirror differences in sociability.
