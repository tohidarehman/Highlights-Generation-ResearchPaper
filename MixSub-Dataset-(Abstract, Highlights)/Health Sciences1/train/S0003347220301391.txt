 Sex differences in anxiety related behaviours have been documented in many animals and are notable in human populations . A major goal in behaviour research is to understand why and how sex differences in cognitive emotional states like anxiety arise and are regulated throughout life . Anxiety allows individuals to detect and respond to threats . Mating is a candidate regulator for anxiety because threats are likely to change often in sex specific ways when individuals shift to a postmating reproductive state . However we know little about how mating mediates anxiety related behaviour in males and females or about how males might influence female anxiety via seminal proteins transferred during mating . To address this gap we examined anxiety related behaviour in the fruit fly

@highlight Many animals display anxiety but few studies have compared males and females.
@highlight In fruit flies we found no sex differences in anxiety like behaviour.
@highlight Mating could modulate anxiety directly or via male ejaculate proteins.
@highlight We found that anxiety was independent from mating and the sex peptide protein.
@highlight Anxiety is not part of the postmating behavioural shift in fruit flies.
