 Recent studies suggest heavy vehicle drivers self estimate their sleepiness unexpectedly low during night duties . The present study compared sleepiness ratings of long haul truck drivers with those of long haul airline pilots during night and non night duties . In addition the correspondence between self rated manifest and predicted latent sleepiness was examined in the two groups . Twenty two drivers and 33 pilots participated . Their working hours sleep on duty sleepiness and use of sleepiness countermeasures were measured in naturalistic conditions . Predictions of latent sleepiness were based on the measurements of working hours and sleep using the Sleep Wake Predictor modelling tool . Drivers rated lower levels of sleepiness than pilots during both duty types though predicted latent sleepiness levels were very similar among the two groups . Neither the results of sleep nor those of sleepiness countermeasures explained the difference in self rated sleepiness . The results raise the possibility that long haul truck drivers are actually sleepier than they report and thus are at an increased risk for not responding to sleepiness in a timely manner . A potential explanation for this behavior is lack of education and training on sleepiness among truck drivers as compared with airline pilots . Alternatively long haul truck drivers may be exceptionally tolerant to soporific working conditions . The first reported results do not however support this hypothesis .

@highlight Long haul truck drivers rate lower sleepiness levels than long haul airline pilots.
@highlight Predicted sleepiness levels do not differ between these occupational groups.
@highlight Long haul truck drivers may be sleepier than they report.
@highlight Long haul truck drivers may underreact to sleepiness.
