 In this paper we review the state of the art approaches for knee articular cartilage segmentation from conventional techniques to deep learning based techniques . Knee articular cartilage segmentation on magnetic resonance images is of great importance in early diagnosis of osteoarthritis . Besides segmentation allows estimating the articular cartilage loss rate which is utilised in clinical practice for assessing the disease progression and morphological changes . It has been traditionally applied in quantifying longitudinal knee OA progression pattern to detect and assess the articular cartilage thickness and volume . Topics covered include various image processing algorithms and major features of different segmentation techniques feature computations and the performance evaluation metrics . This paper is intended to provide researchers with a broad overview of the currently existing methods in the field as well as to highlight the shortcomings and potential considerations in the application at clinical practice . The survey showed that state of the art techniques based on DL outperform the other segmentation methods . The analysis of the existing methods reveals that integration of DL based algorithms with other traditional model based approaches has achieved the best results between 85.8 and 90 .
