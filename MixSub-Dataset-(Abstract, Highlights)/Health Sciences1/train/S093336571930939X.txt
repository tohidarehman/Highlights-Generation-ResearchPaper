 Window settings to rescale and contrast stretch raw data from radiographic images such as Computed Tomography X ray and Magnetic Resonance images is a crucial step as data pre processing to examine abnormalities and diagnose diseases . We propose a distant supervised method for determining automatically the best window settings by attaching a window estimator module to a deep convolutional neural network based lesion classifier and training them in conjunction . Aside from predicting a flexible window setting for each raw image we statistically identify the top four window settings by calculating the mean and standard deviations for the entire dataset . Images are scaled on each of the top settings estimated by WEM and following lesion classifiers are subsequently trained . We study the effects of only using the flexible window the single fixed window as either a known default window used by radiologists or an estimated mean value and two different approaches to combine results from the top window settings to improve the detection of intracranial hemorrhage from brain CT images . Experimental results showed that using the top four window settings identified from the window estimator module and combining the results had the best performance .

@highlight This novel approach adds a CT window estimator module to a deep convolutional neural network and trains them end to end for improved predictions.
@highlight The learnable module is trained with distant supervision to approximate the best window settings for CT without prior knowledge of known values.
@highlight Raw CT images are scaled at several candidate settings discovered by the trained window estimator and combined to model better lesion classifiers.
@highlight Lesion classification performance of the combined models exceeded those of models trained on both default windows and fine tuned from default.
