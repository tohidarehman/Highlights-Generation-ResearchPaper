 Caudal autotomy the voluntary shedding of a tail is a last ditch strategy used by many lizard species to escape from predators . There are several costs associated with caudal autotomy that may cause lizards to change their behaviour during tail regeneration . These behavioural changes may be dependent upon individual differences in response to autotomy and or the degree of tail loss as many lizards have the capacity to only partially shed their tail which probably entails fewer costs relative to complete autotomy . However no study to our knowledge has considered how caudal autotomy or the extent of autotomy affects individual behavioural variation . Accordingly we investigated the effects of both partial and complete tail loss on individual behavioural variation in delicate skinks

@highlight Lizards can shed their tail to escape predators but this strategy comes at a cost.
@highlight The magnitude of this cost is likely to be dependent on the amount of tail shed.
@highlight Complete tail loss impacted behaviours linked to locomotion and predator escape.
@highlight Complete tail loss also led to more predictable less plastic behaviour.
@highlight These behavioural impacts were not found in lizards experiencing partial tail loss.
