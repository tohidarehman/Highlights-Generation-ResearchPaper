 Experience can modify how animals respond to relevant stimuli from their environment for example through associative learning . In particular odour stimuli play a central role in foraging by influencing decision making . Numerous studies have shown that odours can acquire relevance for an animal by becoming associated with food after appetitive experience . Therefore studying to what extent learning can modulate the behavioural response to olfactory stimuli is essential to improve our understanding about the role of experience in food exploitation in nature . Here we evaluated whether foraging experience can modulate the response of
