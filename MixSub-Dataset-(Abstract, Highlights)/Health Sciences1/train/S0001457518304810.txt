 Recent field data analyses have shown that lumbar spine fractures occurred more frequently in late model vehicles than the early ones in frontal crashes . Therefore the objective of this study was to investigate risk factors associated with lumbar spine fractures in frontal crashes .

@highlight Risk factors of lumbar spine fractures in frontal crashes were investigated through parametric simulations.
@highlight Conflicting effects were found between submarining and lumbar spine fractures.
@highlight Occupant reclined posture severe crash pulse early pulse peak and vehicle pitch angle could also increase lumbar forces in frontal crashes.
