 This study applies a simulation based traffic conflict technique to evaluate the hypothesis that sun glare under upper vents exerts negative impacts on traffic safety in urban tunnels . A modified cellular automata model is applied to simulate the deceleration behavior due to sun glare in real traffic . And the model is calibrated and validated against the empirical data . Conict occurrences are generated through simulating vehicular interactions based on this model . Simulation experiments are conducted with different density and illuminance to evaluate the safety impacts of sun glare . Comparison of simulated conict occurrences shows that rear end conflicts occur more frequently as illuminance and density get higher . And the impacts of sun glare are more obvious on weak conflicts in moderate density flow and more severe conflicts in high density flows respectively . To alleviate the negative impacts of sun glare a sunshade system is designed based on the quantitative results .

@highlight A modified CA model for urban tunnel is proposed and validated.
@highlight The safety impact of sun glare in urban tunnel is studied.
@highlight A conceptualized sunshade system is designed to improve safety conditions in urban tunnel.
