 The sense of olfaction has been traditionally considered of low relevance in bird biology . In particular the location of cached seeds by scatter hoarder corvids is assumed to depend on spatial memory whereas no study has demonstrated the use of olfaction to detect these seeds . In this study we tested whether olfaction might play a role in the precise location of cached nuts by magpies

@highlight Olfaction has been neglected in studies of seed retrieval in scatter hoarder birds.
@highlight We experimentally studied the role of smell in buried seed detection in magpies.
@highlight Magpies detected buried natural nuts and discarded 3D printed fake nuts.
@highlight Results suggest that magpies make use of olfaction to pinpoint cached nuts.
@highlight Olfaction might help spatial memory in the location of cached nuts in corvids.
