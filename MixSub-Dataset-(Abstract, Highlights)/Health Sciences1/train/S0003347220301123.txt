 All activity imposes costs but animals can often alter the timing of their activity to reduce these costs . Metabolic costs of activity are especially high during seasons of energy deficits but the extent to which animals can adjust their activity timing to reduce metabolic costs is unclear . Here we test the hypothesis that the timing of small mammal activity during winter minimizes heat loss . Using motion activated cameras deployed under snow we show that a widely distributed nocturnal small mammal species white footed mouse

@highlight Small mammal species used different strategies to avoid cold winter temperatures.
@highlight switched from nocturnal to diurnal activity on cold days.
@highlight avoided activity entirely on cold days.
@highlight Plasticity in activity timing reduced energy lost as heat.
