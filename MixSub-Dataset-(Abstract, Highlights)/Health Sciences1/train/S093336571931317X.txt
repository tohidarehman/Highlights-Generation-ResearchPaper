 Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of death and disability worldwide . Automated brain hematoma segmentation and outcome prediction for patients with TBI can effectively facilitate patient management . In this study we propose a novel Multi view convolutional neural network with a mixed loss to segment total acute hematoma on head CT scans collected within 24h after the injury . Based on the automated segmentation the volumetric distribution and shape characteristics of the hematoma were extracted and combined with other clinical observations to predict 6 month mortality . The proposed hematoma segmentation network achieved an average Dice coefficient of 0.697 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.966 between the volumes estimated from the predicted hematoma segmentation and volumes of the annotated hematoma segmentation on the test set . Compared with other published methods the proposed method has the most accurate segmentation performance and volume estimation . For 6 month mortality prediction the model achieved an average area under the precision recall curve of 0.559 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.853 using 10 fold cross validation on a dataset consisting of 828 patients . The average AUCPR and AUC of the proposed model are respectively more than 10 and 5 higher than those of the widely used IMPACT model .

@highlight A new multi view network is developed to segment total acute hematoma on brain CT scans from patients with acute traumatic brain injury.
@highlight A novel mixed loss function is proposed to improve the model s generalization.
@highlight The proposed hematoma segmentation framework was validated on a heterogeneous dataset.
@highlight Quantitative hematoma characteristics greatly improve the 6 month mortality prediction.
