 The clinical assessment after stroke depends on the rating scale usually lack of quantitative feedback such as biomedical signal captured from stroke patients . This study attempts to develop a unified assessment framework for persons after stroke via surface electromyography bias from bilateral limbs based on four types of selected movements namely forward lift arm lateral lift arm forearm internal external rotation forearm pronation supination . Eleven healthy subjects and six stroke patients are recruited to participate in the experiment to perform the bilateral mirrored paradigm with six channels of sEMG signals recorded from each of their arms . The linear discriminant analysis random forest algorithm and support vector machine are adopted trained and used for stroke patients qualitative recognition . The bilateral bias diagnosis algorithm is developed to evaluate the stroke severity quantitatively based on the similarity index of the sEMG . The results reveal that the sEMG feature bias of bilateral arms for stroke patients is different from that of healthy people the RF and SVM demonstrate a better performance with an average recognition accuracy of 0.920.12 and 0.930.12 than LDA in distinguishing stroke patients from healthy subjects there is a strong positive correlation between SI and the Fugl Meyer score

@highlight The sEMG features bias between bilateral arms are changed after stroke.
@highlight Mirror contraction of bilateral arm contributes to EMG based stroke recognition and severity assessment.
@highlight The bilateral arms differences of stroke patients are linear correlated with FuglMeyer scores.
@highlight Intelligent stroke evaluation based on sEMG analytics can be automated with less involvement of therapists.
