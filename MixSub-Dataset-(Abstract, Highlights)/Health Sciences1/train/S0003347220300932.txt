 Fissionfusion social dynamics are common among a number of vertebrate taxa and yet the factors shaping these variable associations among subgroup members have not been widely addressed . Associations may occur simply because of shared habitat preferences however social ties may also be influenced by genetic relatedness or social attraction . Here we investigate the association patterns of wild black and white ruffed lemurs

@highlight We examined social association spatial overlap and relatedness in ruffed lemurs.
@highlight We found weak social association low pairwise relatedness and little spatial overlap.
@highlight Relatedness was not correlated with social association or social preference.
@highlight Social association was instead strongly related to space use.
@highlight Other factors are likely to account for some of the variation in social association.
