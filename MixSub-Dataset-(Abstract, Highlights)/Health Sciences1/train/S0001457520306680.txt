 The identification of accident hot spots is a central task of road safety management . Bayesian count data models have emerged as the workhorse method for producing probabilistic rankings of hazardous sites in road networks . Typically these methods assume simple linear link function specifications which however limit the predictive power of a model . Furthermore extensive specification searches are precluded by complex model structures arising from the need to account for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial correlations . Modern machine learning methods offer ways to automate the specification of the link function . However these methods do not capture estimation uncertainty and it is also difficult to incorporate spatial correlations . In light of these gaps in the literature this paper proposes a new spatial negative binomial model which uses Bayesian additive regression trees to endogenously select the specification of the link function . Posterior inference in the proposed model is made feasible with the help of the Plya Gamma data augmentation technique . We test the performance of this new model on a crash count data set from a metropolitan highway network . The empirical results show that the proposed model performs at least as well as a baseline spatial count data model with random parameters in terms of goodness of fit and site ranking ability .
