 In insects cuticular hydrocarbon profiles are complex phenotypic traits with several functions they provide protection against pathogens and water loss and convey information about insect identity . They are particularly important in ants as they are the basis for colony specific signatures which allow nestmate recognition and thus help colonies protect their resources from competitors . Several studies have shown that levels of n alkanes are strongly influenced by the environment and that alongside methyl branched alkanes n alkanes are involved in various signalling tasks . Here we analysed the CHCs of the ant
