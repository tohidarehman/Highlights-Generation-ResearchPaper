 Theory expects contestants to adjust their investment in fighting in line with the perceived value of a resource . Thus we expect to see an increase in contest duration or aggressive actions if the subjective value of the resource is estimated to be high relative to occasions where the value is estimated to be low . Although this expectation is well established in theory we know little about how contestants structure their contests over resources in the wild in particular how variation in resource availability affects how contestants invest in fights . The objectives of this study were twofold to examine whether the structure of malemale fights varied with presence and abundance of oestrous females in the population and there was an association between investment in fighting and mating success during fights between fallow deer

@highlight Theory suggests that contestants should vary investment in line with resource value.
@highlight Subordinate contestants increased their investment in fighting during the rut.
@highlight An increase in display behaviour was associated with fewer matings for subordinates.
@highlight Increases in attacking actions was associated with greater matings for dominants.
@highlight Investment decisions during fights are based on resource value not opponent quality.
