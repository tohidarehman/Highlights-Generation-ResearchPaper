 Evidence of music therapy as an effective supportive therapy in invasive cardiac procedures is increasing but more research is needed . To evaluate the impact of music therapy on stress responses during cardiac device lead extraction procedures performed in local anaesthesia . Sixty four patients undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device lead extraction at Oslo University Hospital Ulleval from March 2018 to September 2019 were randomized to music therapy in the music therapy vs. 10.00 in the control group In this study of music therapy during cardiac device lead extractions no effect was found on patient satisfaction with pain management or average pain level . A decrease in patient anxiety of borderline significance was observed in the music therapy group . More studies with more sensitive measures of pain and anxiety are needed to determine the value of music therapy in invasive cardiac procedures .

@highlight Music therapy was applied in cardiac device lead extraction procedures.
@highlight Intervention patients received individually facilitated music listening.
@highlight Levels of pain and patient satisfaction were equal in both groups.
@highlight Anxiety levels decreased for music therapy patients.
