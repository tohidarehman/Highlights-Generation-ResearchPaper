 Rapid colour change is widespread in animals and allows them to respond dynamically to the physical and social environment . However few studies have examined the information conveyed by dynamic colour signals in different social contexts such as courtship and rivalry contests . Furthermore dynamic colour change on different body regions may be subject to different selection pressures and therefore serve different functions . We tested whether male colour or colour change predicts contest outcome in malemale interactions or the likelihood of copulation attempts in malefemale interactions in the central bearded dragon

@highlight Male bearded dragon lizards change colour during interactions with other lizards.
@highlight Winners had darker beards and their beard changed more than those of losers.
@highlight Residency was the strongest predictor of contest outcome.
@highlight Neither colour nor the extent of colour change predicted copulation attempts.
