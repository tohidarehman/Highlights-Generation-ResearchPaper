 Graph signal processing is a framework that enables the generalization of signal processing to multivariate signals described on graphs . In this paper we present an approach based on Graph Fourier Transform and machine learning for the analysis of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging . For each subject we use rs fMRI time series to compute several descriptive statistics in regions of interest . Next these measures are considered as signals on an averaged structural graph built using tractography of the white matter of the brain defined using the same ROI . GFT of these signals is computed using the structural graph as a support and the obtained feature vectors are subsequently benchmarked in a supervised learning setting . Further analysis suggests that GFT using structural connectivity as a graph and the standard deviation of fMRI time series as signals leads to more accurate supervised classification using a world wide multi site database known as ABIDE when compared to several other statistical metrics . Moreover the proposed approach outperforms several approaches based on using functional connectomes or complex functional network measures as features for classification .

@highlight A novel modelling time series approach which is applied on rs fMRI brain imaging is presented.
@highlight The proposed approach restores informative features related to neuro psychiatric disease such as Autism Spectrum Disorder as exemplified by statistically robust gains in classification metrics when compared to other feature extraction methods.
@highlight The proposed approach decreases the amount of data needed to store patient imaging data history.
@highlight The proposed analysis method is validated on a world wide multi site database ABIDE in which different methods of imaging acquisition were used.
