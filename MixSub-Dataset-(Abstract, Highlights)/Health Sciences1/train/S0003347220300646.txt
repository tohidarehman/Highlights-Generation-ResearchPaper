 Parents increase their fitness by investing resources in offspring . However such investment is costly for parents leading to trade offs which should shift towards heavier investment in reproduction as females age and future reproductive opportunities decrease . Nests of aquatic turtles laid farther from water have higher survival than those laid closer to shore because nest predators often forage along environmental edges . However the predation risk of adult females increases farther from water because water is used as refuge from terrestrial predators . Thus females may balance investment in current offspring versus maternal survival and future offspring . To test whether investment varies depending upon perceived risk we exposed 30 painted turtles

@highlight We test whether investment varies with perceived predation risk in a turtle.
@highlight Females did not nest closer to the safety of water after simulated predation.
@highlight Older females nested in riskier areas than younger females to increase nest survival.
@highlight After simulated predation females nested in areas with lower nest survival.
