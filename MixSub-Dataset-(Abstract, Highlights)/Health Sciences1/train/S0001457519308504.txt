 The prognosis of post traumatic headache is poorly understood . To develop and validate a prognostic model to predict the presence of post traumatic headache six months after a traffic collision in adults with incident post traumatic headache . Secondary analyses of adults with incident post traumatic headache injured in traffic collisions between November 1997 and December 1999 in Saskatchewan Canada and between January 2004 and January 2005 in Sweden . The Saskatchewan cohort was population based . The Swedish cohort were claimants from two insurance companies covering 20 of cars driven in Sweden in 2004 . All adults injured in traffic collisions who completed a baseline questionnaire within 30 days of collision . Excluded were those hospitalized 2 days lost consciousness 30 min or reported headache 3 10 on the numerical rating scale . Follow up rates for both cohorts were approximately 80 . Baseline sociodemographic pre injury and injury factors . Self reported headache pain intensity 3 six months after injury . Both cohorts were predominantly female with median ages 35.9 years and 38.0 years . Predictors were age work status headache pain intensity symptoms in arms or hands dizziness or unsteadiness stiffness in neck pre existing headache and lower recovery expectations . With a positive score the model can rule in the presence of post traumatic headache at six months 8.0 95 CI 2.724.1 negative likelihood ratio 1.0 95 CI 1.01.0 validation specificity 95.5 95 CI 91.1 97.8 sensitivity 27.2 95 CI 20.4 35.2 LR 6.0 95 CI 2.813.2 LR 0.8 95 CI 0.70.8 . Clinicians can collect patient information on the eight predictors of our model to identify patients that will report ongoing post traumatic headache six months after a traffic collision . Future research should focus on selecting patients at high risk of poor outcomes for inclusion in intervention studies and determining effective interventions for these patients .

@highlight Post traumatic headache is common and often persists beyond the acute period.
@highlight Eight predictors collected at baseline predict PTH six months post injury.
@highlight Our model can be used in primary care to predict the likely presence of PTH six months after a traffic collision.
@highlight Our model could inform intervention studies to prevent ongoing PTH.
