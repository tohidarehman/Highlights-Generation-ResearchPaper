 Individual variation in resource acquisition prior to mating can influence the expression of sexually selected traits and mating dynamics . One important resource that has the potential to affect mating is water however little is known about whether variation in individual hydration status impacts mating behaviour . Here we investigate the effects of short term water deprivation on mating behaviour in the harvestman

@highlight The effect of hydration status on mating behaviours is not well established.
@highlight Water deprivation significantly affected mating behaviours of harvestmen.
@highlight The behaviours affected depended on the sex deprived of water.
@highlight We suggest water is an important but often overlooked resource in sexual selection.
