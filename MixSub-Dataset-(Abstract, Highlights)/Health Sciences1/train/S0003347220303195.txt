 Varying forms of polygyny are observed across many animal groups . In some species a male defends a group of females from other males and successful defence leads to greater reproductive success . This is often referred to as harem polygyny and is most observed in mammals . A female biased sex ratio has been associated with harem polygynous species . In such populations formation of harems may be an inevitable consequence of the relative lack of available males rather than multiple females actively choosing to mate with a subset of specific males . Although a rare mating system for insects harem polygyny has been described in several orders including tree wt Orthoptera Anostostomatidae

@highlight Tree wt aggregations in roosts vary depending on sex ratio and population density.
@highlight Males with larger heads are associated with more females.
@highlight Males avoid roosting with other males unless females are present in the roosts also.
