 Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism facilitating adaptation to environmental change that often varies among individuals . One reason for this individual variation is that plasticity may depend on state variables such as size condition or age which affect the costs and benefits of plasticity . Recent theoretical work predicts that plasticity will decrease as an organism ages because costs of plasticity mean that flexible phenotypic adjustments by individuals to environmental change will be less beneficial as age related survival prospects decrease . Here we used

@highlight We tested if plasticity of parental care in burying beetles decreases with age.
@highlight Younger females show greater mean levels of plasticity than older females.
@highlight There is an offspring number size trade off in older but not young beetles.
@highlight Plasticity is less beneficial as age related survival prospects decrease.
@highlight Results support models of the evolution of age dependent plasticity.
