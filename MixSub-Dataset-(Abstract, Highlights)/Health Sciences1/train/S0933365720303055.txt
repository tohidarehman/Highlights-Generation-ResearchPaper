 Recent developments in medical image analysis techniques make them essential tools in medical diagnosis . Medical imaging is always involved with different kinds of uncertainties . Managing these uncertainties has motivated extensive research on medical image classification methods particularly for the past decade . Despite being a powerful classification tool the sparse representation suffers from the lack of sufficient discrimination and robustness which are required to manage the uncertainty and noisiness in medical image classification issues . It is tried to overcome this deficiency by introducing a new fuzzy discriminative robust sparse representation classifier which benefits from the fuzzy terms in its optimization function of the dictionary learning process . In this work we present a new medical image classification approach fuzzy discriminative sparse representation . The proposed fuzzy terms increase the inter class representation difference and the intra class representation similarity . Also an adaptive fuzzy dictionary learning approach is used to learn dictionary atoms . FDSR is applied on Magnetic Resonance Images from three medical image databases . The comprehensive experimental results clearly show that our approach outperforms its series of rival techniques in terms of accuracy sensitivity specificity and convergence speed .
