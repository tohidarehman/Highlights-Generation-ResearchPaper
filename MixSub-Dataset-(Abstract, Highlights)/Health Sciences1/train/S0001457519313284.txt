 Since its discovery at the end of the 1950s hydroplaning has been a matter of concern for drivers on wet roads because it can affect driver safety . Indeed this phenomenon can lead to a complete loss of contact between the tire and the road caused by the layer of water that develops between them resulting in a complete loss of longitudinal and lateral grip .

@highlight The importance of full hydroplaning as a main cause of traffic accident is badly known in the scientific literature.
@highlight German In Depth Accident Study GIDAS enables to get relevant objective data from accidents.
@highlight Associated to a physical analysis an evaluation of the share of full hydroplaning as accident main cause was conducted.
@highlight It appears that full hydroplaning accident exists but they are much rarer than most driver think.
