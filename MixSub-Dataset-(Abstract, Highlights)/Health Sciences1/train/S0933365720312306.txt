 Medicine is at a disciplinary crossroads . With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now . Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community . At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed . For AI to account for the past and build a better future we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools . The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better . AI is an opportunity and a mirror for all disciplines to improve their impact on society and for medicine the stakes could not be higher .

@highlight Medical errors and biases have disadvantaged vulnerable patient groups for centuries.
@highlight These biases persist today in our medical assessment frameworks diagnostic tools and educational curricula.
@highlight New Medical AI systems built from current clinical practice pose the risk of further widening population health inequalities.

@highlight The decisions we make now will determine whether we codify and exacerbate existing inequity or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better.
