 Speeding has been a great concern around the world due to the occurrence and severity of road crashes . This paper presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of different penalty and camera based enforcement strategies in curbing speeding offences by professional drivers in Hong Kong . A stated preference survey approach is employed to measure the association between penalty and enforcement strategies and drivers speed choices . Data suggest that almost all drivers comply with speed limits when they reach a camera housing section of the road . For other road sections a panel mixed logit model is estimated and applied to understand the effectiveness of penalties and enforcement strategies on drivers speeding behaviors . Driving offence points are found to be more effective than monetary fines in deterring speeding offences albeit there is significant heterogeneity in how drivers respond to these strategies . Warning drivers of an upcoming camera based enforcement section increased speed compliance . Several demographic and employment characteristics driving history and perception variables also influence drivers choices of speed compliance . Finally besides penalty and enforcement strategies driver education and training programs aimed at addressing aggressiveness risk taking traits might help reduce repeated speeding offences among drivers .
