 Previous research has demonstrated that the distraction caused by holding a mobile telephone conversation is not limited to the period of the actual conversation . In a prior study we identified potential eye movement and EEG markers of cognitive distraction during driving hazard perception . However the extent to which these markers are affected by the demands of the hazard perception task are unclear . Therefore in the current study we assessed the effects of secondary cognitive task demand on eye movement and EEG metrics separately for periods prior to during and after the hazard was visible . We found that when no hazard was present distraction resulted in changes to various elements of saccadic eye movements . However when the target was present distraction did not affect eye movements .

@highlight Effect of cognitive load was assessed on behavioral eye movement and EEG metrics.
@highlight Elements of the saccadic eye movement system can be used as markers of distraction.
@highlight Eye fixation related potentials are sensitive to changes in cognitive workload.
@highlight Markers of distraction were present prior to reduction in primary task performance.
