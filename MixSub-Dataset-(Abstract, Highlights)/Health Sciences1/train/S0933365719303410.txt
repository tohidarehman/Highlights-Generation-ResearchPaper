 Over the years there has been growing interest in using machine learning techniques for biomedical data processing . When tackling these tasks one needs to bear in mind that biomedical data depends on a variety of characteristics such as demographic aspects or the acquisition technology which might be unrelated with the target of the analysis . In supervised tasks failing to match the ground truth targets with respect to such characteristics called confounders may lead to very misleading estimates of the predictive performance . Many strategies have been proposed to handle confounders ranging from data selection to normalization techniques up to the use of training algorithm for learning with imbalanced data . However all these solutions require the confounders to be known a priori . To this aim we introduce a novel index that is able to measure the confounding effect of a data attribute in a bias agnostic way . This index can be used to quantitatively compare the confounding effects of different variables and to inform correction methods such as normalization procedures or ad hoc prepared learning algorithms . The effectiveness of this index is validated on both simulated data and real world neuroimaging data .

@highlight A novel index is introduced to measure the confounding effect of a categorical variable in classification studies.
@highlight The index is also used for continuously distributed variables by binning their values.
@highlight The index can rank the effect of various variables allowing to determine affordable matching criteria.
@highlight The index can assess the effectiveness of a normalization procedure and the robustness of a learning model against confounding effects.
@highlight The validity and usefulness of the index is proved both on simulated and real world neuroimaging data.
