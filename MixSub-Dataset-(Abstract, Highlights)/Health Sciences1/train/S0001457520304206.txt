 In the geometric design of roundabouts safety oriented approaches are required rather than specification design ones that simply determine the dimensions of the geometric structural elements . We herein propose a risk index that combines the invisibility probability and the crash impact as a performance measure for evaluating the safety of the geometric designs of roundabouts and we also describe a method for calculating this index . Invisibility probability represents the probability that an entering vehicle can not view a vehicle coming from the upstream in a circulatory roadway and crash impact represents the amount of lost kinetic energy at the time of collision corresponds to the impact of the crash . A numerical simulation to model this RI on the basis of various geometric conditions is further presented . It is demonstrated that the invisibility probability is large when the entry angle is small and that the crash impact increases when the deviation angle decreases . The proposed approach is expected to help resolve issues with currently existing roundabouts and improve the design of future roundabouts to enhance their safety performance .
