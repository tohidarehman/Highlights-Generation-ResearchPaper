 Predation success depends on factors such as hunger prey size prey availability and intensity of competition . A neglected factor that may also influence predation success is the proper function of morphological traits related to prey search capture and manipulation . Injuries that compromise the functionality of these morphological traits may reduce predation success . In many invertebrates autotomy can compromise predation success because the detached body part may be crucial for hunting . However empirical evidence linking autotomy and predation success is relatively scarce . We filled this gap using the scorpion

@highlight Some morphological traits are crucial for prey capture and subjugation.
@highlight The functionality of these traits is thus crucial for predation success.
@highlight Tail autotomy in scorpions causes loss of the stinger used for venom inoculation.
@highlight Stinger loss reduced subduing success of both small and large prey.
@highlight In conclusion tail autotomy is costly because it decreases predation success.
