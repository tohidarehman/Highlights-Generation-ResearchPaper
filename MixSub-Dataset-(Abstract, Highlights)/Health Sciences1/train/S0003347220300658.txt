 Spatial cohesion in group living animals is assumed as a risk sensitive characteristic . Few studies have explicitly investigated this assumption or asked whether risk related changes in spatial cohesion operate over short term or long term scales . We explored whether two groups of wild samango monkeys

@highlight Animal group spatial cohesion is often assumed as a risk sensitive characteristic.
@highlight We studied two groups of wild samango monkey exposed to natural risk.
@highlight Both reactive and pre emptive responses to risk were considered.
@highlight Groups increased cohesion during intergroup conflict but not during eagle encounters.
@highlight One group was more cohesive in locations of high eagle risk on the landscape.
