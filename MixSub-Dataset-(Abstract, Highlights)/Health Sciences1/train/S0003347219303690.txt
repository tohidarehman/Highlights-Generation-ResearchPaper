 Understanding the sources of variation in reproductive fitness is a central goal of sexual selection research . Research investigating factors limiting male reproductive potential typically focus on limited mate availability or mate access . This focus often minimizes the potential relevance of physiological or other limitations on male reproductive potential in contrast to the emphasis on studying such limitations in females . This gap in knowledge leaves open questions about how variation in male reproductive success emerges across successive mating bouts . Here we contribute to bridging this gap by examining male reproductive potential across successive matings and across time . To reveal limits to male reproductive potential and sources of variation in these limits we measured mating rate and offspring production in

@highlight Limits to reproductive potential are surprisingly understudied in males.
@highlight We allowed male flies unlimited mating opportunities to reveal reproductive limits.
@highlight We found that males who mated with more females did not always sire more offspring.
@highlight Females who received low quality mates remated rapidly.
@highlight These findings suggest an upper bound on the reproductive success of any one male.
