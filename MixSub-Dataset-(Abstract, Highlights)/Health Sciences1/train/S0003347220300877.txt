 Social relationships can have important fitness consequences . Although there is increasing evidence that social relationships carry over across contexts few studies have investigated whether relationships formed early in life are carried over to adulthood . For example juveniles of monogamous species go through a major life history stage transition pair formation during which the pair bond becomes a central unit of the social organization . At present it remains unclear whether pair members retain their early life relationships after pair formation . We investigated whether same sex associations formed early in life carry over into adulthood and whether carryover was dependent on season in a monogamous species . We also investigated the role of familiarity genetic relatedness and aggression on the perseverance of social associations . We studied the social structure before and after pair formation in captive barnacle geese

@highlight Few studies have investigated whether early life bonds carry over into adulthood.
@highlight We studied the maintenance of early life bonds after pair formation in geese.
@highlight In females early life bonds were lost during breeding but resurfaced during winter.
@highlight In males the early life bonds persisted across both seasons.
@highlight Our study shows that early life bonds can have lifelong consequences.
