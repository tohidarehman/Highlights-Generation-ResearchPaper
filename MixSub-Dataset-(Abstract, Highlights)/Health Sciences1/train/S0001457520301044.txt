 Even with automated vehicles driving situations with short time headways and extreme vehicle dynamics may arise when unpredictable events occur . If drivers take back control under such conditions it is uncertain how they behave and how well they can cope with the situation . This issue has not been investigated yet and is subject to our study . In a driving simulator non distracted participants

@highlight Time headway and traction usage were varied to create brake situations of different objective criticality.
@highlight With increasing objective criticality criticality ratings increased decelerations were higher and more lane changes occurred.
@highlight Participants overreacted and increased accident risk when taking over in critical brake situations.
