 Urbanization rapidly alters the environment often leading to decreased biodiversity . One abiotic selection pressure uniquely associated with urbanization is the urban heat island effectwherein built structures capture heat during the day retain it through the dark cycle and result in significantly elevated night time temperatures . Relatively few studies have asked what effects the UHI might have on the development and behaviour of urban animals and even fewer have asked this question of urban arthropod pests who rely on external heat sources and can experience explosive urban population growth rates . In particular behavioural plasticity is often cited as a critical phenotype for organisms to thrive after rapid environmental change such as urbanization . Here the relationship between elevated urban temperatures and behaviour was examined in the western black widow spider

@highlight Black widow spiders experience an extreme urban heat island UHI in Phoenix AZ U.S.A.
@highlight Behavioural plasticity may allow urban animals to survive urban disturbance.
@highlight We show that the UHI greatly limits black widow development.
@highlight Under UHI temperatures spiders increase web building voracity and cannibalism.
