 Sleep disruptions are common in pregnancy and can have significant maternal and infant health consequences . Management of sleep using a personal health monitoring device may be effective in promoting behavior change and contribute to improved pregnancy related sleep . The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to determine the feasibility of recruitment retention adherence and data collection methods with a sample of pregnant women at 24weeks gestation for a 12 week intervention using a PHM device . Of 24 enrolled participants 20 were retained through the 12 week intervention and the follow up at 24weeks postpartum . The majority of participants had a four year education and identified as White . Ninety one percent wore the device for at least ten weeks . Pregnant women may be willing engage in sleep intervention research and wear a PHM to self monitor sleep during pregnancy . Future research should consider recruitment methods tailored to recruit diverse populations of pregnant women .

@highlight In both groups 83 of participants were retained through postpartum follow up.
@highlight Eleven 91.6 intervention participants wore the device daily for 10weeks.
@highlight Facebook was the most successful recruitment method.
