 Spatial patterns in moving fish shoals originate from social interactions and are driven by factors that benefit individuals such as predator avoidance or reduced energy expenditure . How shoaling is influenced by the presence and absence of a flow field is only partially understood . Adopting a reductionist approach time spent shoaling shoal structure and information transfer between pairs of Eurasian minnows

@highlight Swimming minnow pairs were recorded in static and flowing water.
@highlight Minnow pairs adopted a side by side configuration in flowing water.
@highlight A side by side configuration led to effective bidirectional information transfer.
@highlight Shoaling was reduced in the absence of flow and fish adopted positions in tandem.
@highlight Information transfer was unidirectional front to back in tandem configuration.
