 The study of vocal communication in nonhuman primates especially apes offers critical insight into the origins of human language . Although human language represents a highly derived and complex form of communication researchers have found that the organization of language follows a series of common statistical patterns known as linguistic laws . Zipf s law of brevity and Menzerath s law are pervasive across human languages and these laws have been identified in the communication of a small number of primate species . What remains less clear is whether these two laws also affect long distance vocal communication in primates . Here we provide evidence that the long distance morning calls of male gibbons cao vit gibbon

@highlight Male gibbon morning calls conform to Zipf s law of brevity and Menzerath s law.
@highlight The most common notes being shortest in duration.
@highlight Longer sequences are made up of shorter calls on average.
