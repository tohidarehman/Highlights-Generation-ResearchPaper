 Behavioural thermoregulation can ameliorate thermal stress but is costly . For species that court in a thermally stressful microhabitat sexual selection via endurance rivalry favours individuals that are able and willing to endure harsh conditions in the courtship habitat as retreats to a thermal refuge will reduce mating opportunities . The relative costs and benefits of refuge use versus continued courtship in the face of thermal risk which vary across abiotic and biotic contexts determine the optimal behavioural strategy . We examined the social and abiotic factors driving behavioural decisions related to thermoregulatory retreat in the fiddler crab

@highlight Male fiddler crabs face a trade off between courtship and thermoregulation.
@highlight Time on the surface where courtship occurs is limited by high temperatures.
@highlight Male fiddler crabs took greater thermal risks in the presence of a female.
@highlight Thermal retreat decisions depend on social and abiotic conditions.
