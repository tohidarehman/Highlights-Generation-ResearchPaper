 The effect of mandated societal lockdown to reduce the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 on road traffic accidents is not known . For this reason we performed an in depth analysis using data from Statewide Traffic Accident Records System . We reviewed data on total 2292 road traffic accident records in Missouri from January 1 2020 through May 15 2020 . We treated March 23 as the first day of mandated societal lockdown and May 3 as the first day of re opening . We have found that there was a significant reduction in road traffic accidents resulting in minor or no injuries but not in accidents resulting in serious or fatal injuries after mandated societal lockdown . Furthermore there was a significant reduction in road traffic accidents resulting in minor or no injuries after the mandated social lockdown in the time series analysis . There was an increase in road traffic accidents resulting in minor or no injuries after expiration of mandatory societal lockdown . The mandated societal lockdown policies led to reduction in road traffic accidents resulting in non serious or no injuries but not those resulting in serious or fatal injuries .
