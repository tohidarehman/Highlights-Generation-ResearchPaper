 Living in groups can benefit individuals in many ways including in innovative problem solving . Several hypotheses have suggested mechanisms to explain why larger groups disproportionately outperform smaller groups including the skill pool and pool of competence effects . However disentangling these potential mechanisms from the effects of group size alone has been challenging . Here we first outline key ways in which group size can shape performance in innovative problem solving . We then detail the nonlinear nature of the mathematical relationship between group size and various measures of group performance . Finally we use simulations to confirm that measures of group performance in innovative problem solving scale nonlinearly with group size even in the absence of any other effect . Our study provides guidance on how best to evaluate hypotheses about group composition on innovative problem solving and clarity to help future studies make appropriate assumptions when developing null hypotheses against which to test their empirical data .

@highlight Larger groups innovate and solve problems faster and more often than smaller groups.
@highlight Empirical studies of this relationship typically invoke elaborate explanations.
@highlight Explanations commonly include among others the pool of competence effect.
@highlight A nonlinear relationship between group size and group performance is expected.
@highlight Such a relationship provides no evidence for effects other than group size.
