 Globally patients with the co morbidity of physical and mental illness experience greater health complexities than the general population . Yet nurses caring for medical surgical patients with a secondary diagnosis of mental illness are often unprepared for these complexities . This paper focuses on professional experiences from a more extensive parent study that evaluated components of nursing preparedness to provide care for medical surgical patients who also have mental illness . The parent study explored characteristics of variables more frequently associated with and more predictive of nursing preparedness . Discussed will be the findings from characteristics of professional experiences that best indicated nurse preparedness to care for medical surgical patients with mental illness . A descriptive correlational design was used with a convenience sample of RNs
