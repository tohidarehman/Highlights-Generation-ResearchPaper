 Crash Detection is essential in providing timely information to traffic management centers and the public to reduce its adverse effects . Prediction of crash risk is vital for avoiding secondary crashes and safeguarding highway traffic . For many years researchers have explored several techniques for early and precise detection of crashes to aid in traffic incident management . With recent advancements in data collection techniques abundant real time traffic data is available for use . Big data infrastructure and machine learning algorithms can utilize this data to provide suitable solutions for the highway traffic safety system . This paper explores the feasibility of using deep learning models to detect crash occurrence and predict crash risk . Volume Speed and Sensor Occupancy data collected from roadside radar sensors along Interstate 235 in Des Moines IA is used for this study . This real world traffic data is used to design feature set for the deep learning models for crash detection and crash risk prediction . The results show that a deep model has better crash detection performance and similar crash prediction performance than state of the art shallow models . Additionally a sensitivity analysis was conducted for crash risk prediction using data 1 minute 5 minutes and 10 minutes prior to crash occurrence . It was observed that is hard to predict the crash risk of a traffic condition 10min prior to a crash .
