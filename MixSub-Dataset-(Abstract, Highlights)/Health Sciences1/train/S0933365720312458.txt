 According to functional or anatomical modalities medical imaging provides a visual representation of complex structures or activities in the human body . One of the most common processing methods applied to those images is segmentation in which an image is divided into a set of regions of interest . Human anatomical complexity and medical image acquisition artifacts make segmentation of medical images very complex . Thus several solutions have been proposed to automate image segmentation . However most existing solutions use prior knowledge and or require strong interaction with the user . In this paper we propose a multi agent approach for the segmentation of 3D medical images . This approach is based on a set of autonomous interactive agents that use a modified region growing algorithm and cooperate to segment a 3D image . The first organization of agents allows region seed placement and region growing . In a second organization agent interaction and collaboration allow segmentation refinement by merging the over segmented regions . Experiments are conducted on magnetic resonance images of healthy and pathological brains . The obtained results are promising and demonstrate the efficiency of our method .

@highlight The paper presents a new multi agent approach for medical image segmentation.
@highlight The system uses agents for similarities and discontinuities detection.
@highlight The system was used for Tumor detection and segmentation in Brain MR images.
@highlight The system achieves an average score of 86 Dice index without any prior knowledge.
