 This study explored the attitudes experiences and perceptions of Korean nurses toward advance directives before the establishment of new Well Dying Law . A sequential explanatory mixed method design was applied . We administered a constructed questionnaire on attitudes toward ADs and end of life issues and experience related to end of life decision making . A Korean translated version of the KAESAD was administered by 245 nurses . Semi structured interviews The quantitative results revealed the nurses perspectives on ADs that valuing patient s autonomy authority or rights is vital to the implementation of ADs and end of life decision making . Also nurses reported that patients should be knowledgeable and informed about ADs . These responses allowed us to generate an interview which revealed four themes in adopting the Well Dying Law including ADs . Themes with benefits and roles of health care providers mainly supported the quantitative results . Themes with ethical issues such as disagreement between patients and family members on ADs and preparation regarding adopting the new law should be importantly considered when implementing ADs in clinical settings . Our study highlights that nurses need to develop sufficient knowledge on the laws and communication skills to help patients be knowledgeable and make their own decisions regarding ADs . To successfully adopt the Well Dying Law our findings suggest that a nationwide public campaign and a continuing education program for nurses to manage ethical issues regarding ADs are required .
