 Driving distraction is a leading cause of fatal car accidents and almost nine people are killed in the US each day because of distracting activities . Therefore reducing the number of distraction affected traffic accidents remains an imperative issue . A novel algorithm for detection of drivers manual distraction was proposed in this manuscript . The detection algorithm consists of two modules . The first module predicts the bounding boxes of the driver s right hand and right ear from RGB images . The second module takes the bounding boxes as input and predicts the type of distraction . 106 677 frames extracted from videos which were collected from twenty participants in a driving simulator were used for training and testing . For distraction classification the results indicated that the proposed framework could detect normal driving using the touchscreen and talking with a phone with F1 score 0.84 0.69 0.82 respectively . For overall distraction detection it achieved F1 score of 0.74 . The whole framework ran at 28 frames per second . The algorithm achieved comparable overall accuracy with similar research and was more efficient than other methods . A demo video for the algorithm can be found at

@highlight A novel deep neural network based driving distraction detection algorithm was proposed.
@highlight The algorithm incorporated YOLO and a multi layer perceptron.
@highlight Video clips of 20 drivers performing distracting tasks were collected on a driving simulator.
@highlight The results indicated that the algorithm is effective and efficient in detecting a variety of driving distractions.
