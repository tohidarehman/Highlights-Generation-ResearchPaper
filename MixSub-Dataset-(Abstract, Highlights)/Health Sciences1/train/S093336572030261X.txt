 In clinical settings a lot of medical image datasets suffer from the imbalance problem which hampers the detection of outliers as most classification methods assume an equal occurrence of classes . In this way identifying outliers in imbalanced datasets has become a crucial issue . To help address this challenge one class classification which focuses on learning a model using samples from only a single given class has attracted increasing attention . Previous one class modeling usually uses feature mapping or feature fitting to enforce the feature learning process . However these methods are limited for medical images which usually have complex features . In this paper a novel method is proposed to enable deep learning models to optimally learn single class relevant inherent imaging features by leveraging the concept of imaging complexity . We investigate and compare the effects of simple but effective perturbing operations applied to images to capture imaging complexity and to enhance feature learning . Extensive experiments are performed on four clinical datasets to show that the proposed method outperforms four state of the art methods .
