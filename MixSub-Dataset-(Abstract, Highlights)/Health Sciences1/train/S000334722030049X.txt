 Copying the mate choice of another conspecific by a bystanding observer is a socially mediated alternative mating strategy to independent mate choice . Because increased sperm competition is a potential cost of mate choice copying males should be prudent and less likely to copy the observed mate choice of other males when the latter are more sexually attractive than themselves . We tested this hypothesis using the Trinidadian guppy

@highlight Male Trinidadian guppies copied the observed mate choice of a model competitor.
@highlight Males did not mate choice copy in the absence of a nearby model male.
@highlight The strength of the copying responses was not dependent on male sexual attractiveness.
@highlight The latter finding was not as expected based on sperm competition theory.
