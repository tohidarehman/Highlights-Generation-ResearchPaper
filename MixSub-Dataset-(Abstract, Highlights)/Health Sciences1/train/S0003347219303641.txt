 We used an automated radiotelemetry system to determine diurnal patterns of activity and temporal phenotype in female European starlings during breeding . Parental care is thought to be the most costly part of reproduction with high rates of intense activity due to foraging and provisioning for chicks so we predicted that variation in timing of activity should be closely related to breeding success . Diurnal variation in activity varied systematically with breeding stage in a way consistent with specific demands of each phase of parental care incubating females were more active late in the day 16001800

@highlight Diurnal activity of breeding starlings varied systematically with breeding stage.
@highlight There was low to moderate repeatability of temporal phenotype.
@highlight Chick rearing birds were less active than incubating birds.
@highlight Numerous reproductive fitness measures were independent of temporal phenotype.
