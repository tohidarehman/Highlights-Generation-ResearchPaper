 Avian brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other species leaving the hosts to care for the parasitic offspring . The bookkeeping hypothesis predicts that in order to reduce competition between parasitic nestlings female parasites should keep a mental inventory of host nests that they have already parasitized and avoid laying multiple eggs in the same host nest . However selection against repeat parasitism should be weaker when host nests are limited or when hosts are able to rear more than one parasitic nestling . Here we use microsatellite genotyping of parasitic eggs to test whether female screaming cowbirds

@highlight Screaming cowbirds heavily parasitize greyish baywings in Argentina.
@highlight Genetic data showed that multiple unrelated cowbirds parasitize the same host.
@highlight However repeat parasitism on the same host nest by the same parasite was rare.
@highlight Avoidance of repeat parasitism is consistent with mental bookkeeping by cowbirds.
