 Complex systems exhibit emergent behaviours as a result of the interactions of their components . These components often vary in several traits . Such variation may improve system performance by increasing its efficiency or its robustness to environmental change . These two outcomes efficiency and robustness are often thought to be in opposition . Therefore variation may be beneficial only under certain environmental conditions . Here we aim to understand why variation evolved in a particular system bumble bee

@highlight The function of assumed adaptive size variation in bumble bees is unclear.
@highlight We created colonies with different size variation in stable and unstable conditions.
@highlight Variation did not affect colony performance conditions affected worker physiology.
@highlight Lipid storage increased under unstable conditions particularly in smaller workers.
@highlight Variation may be a neutral trait of a system not under positive selection.
