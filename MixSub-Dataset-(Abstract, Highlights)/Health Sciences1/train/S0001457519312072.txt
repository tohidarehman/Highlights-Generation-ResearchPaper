 Using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Korean revised version we examined the association between habitual alcohol use and risk taking behaviors among car users . We used the data of 15 043 car users aged 20 years or older from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2009 and 2013 . Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the associations between alcohol use and risk taking behaviors while adjusting for individual level covariates . Compared to low risk drinkers high risk drinkers 2.18 95 CI 1.962.42 and intermediate risk drinkers had higher odds of risk taking behaviors while using a car . Stratifying by sociodemographic variables led to differences in the relationship between alcohol drinking level and risk taking behaviors . Furthermore alcohol drinking level had significant positive associations with most of risk taking behaviors especially driving under the influence of alcohol and using a car with a drunken driver . Car users with high levels of alcohol consumption are more likely to be involved in risk taking behaviors especially in driving under the influence of alcohol . While causal relations can not be established due to the nature of the cross sectional design it is possible that individuals habitual alcohol consumption level can influence their risk taking behaviors while using a car .
