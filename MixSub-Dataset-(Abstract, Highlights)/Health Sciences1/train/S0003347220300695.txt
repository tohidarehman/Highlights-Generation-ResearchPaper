 Attempts to unravel the proximate and ultimate causes of individual behavioural and life history variation have often pointed to predicted correlations between behavioural physiological and life history traits forming pace of life syndromes . The POLS hypothesis predicts that high levels of production require high levels of foraging effort and risk taking supported by high metabolism . Despite tremendous interest in this topic the POLS hypothesis still has limited empirical support which has led to calls for more stringent empirical tests of the hypothesis and its assumptions . To that end we examined the associations between risk taking behaviour resting metabolic rate and somatic growth rate in a marine gastropod

@highlight We examined associations between pace of life POLS traits in a marine gastropod.
@highlight Boldness and resting metabolic rate RMR were found to be repeatable over time.
@highlight Individuals that were bolder grew faster and had higher RMR.
@highlight Results support a pace of life syndrome linking RMR growth and boldness.
