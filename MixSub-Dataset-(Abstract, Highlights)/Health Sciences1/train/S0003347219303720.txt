 The defensive repertoires of prey are shaped by diverse ecological and evolutionary demands . This can generate trade offs between the components of defences as in the classic fight or flight dichotomy or dedicated investment in a singular end allowing individuals in better condition to mount a more effective defence all round . Further sexual dimorphism may drive sex differences in such responses although our understanding of the interaction between sexual selection and defensive behaviour is in its infancy . Deimatic or startle defences typically combine multiple protective strategies such as camouflage and aposematism with a rapid transition between them and thus offer unique opportunities for studying the dynamics of suites of defensive behaviours . Here we examined the display of the sexually dimorphic mountain katydid

@highlight Deimatic displays seemingly provide prey with a best of both worlds defence.
@highlight Mountain katydids are cryptic at rest and reveal striking colours when attacked.
@highlight We tested for fight or flight trade offs and variation by experience and sex.
@highlight Sexes respond differently to attack and in the trade off between display and escape.
@highlight We need to consider dimorphism and condition when studying complex defences.
