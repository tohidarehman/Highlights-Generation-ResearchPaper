Evaluation of the Knowledge Fall Prevention and Fall Prevention Behavior outcomes showed that patients have a limited level of knowledge and rarely demonstrated preventive behavior . Vital Signs Medication Response and Safe Health Care Environment pointed to the existence of adequate patient monitoring and safe environment . The evaluation of patient outcomes supported by a standardized classification system such as the NOC highlights the patient s clinical evolution and produces data that support the planning of care and management interventions providing more effective and safer practices .
