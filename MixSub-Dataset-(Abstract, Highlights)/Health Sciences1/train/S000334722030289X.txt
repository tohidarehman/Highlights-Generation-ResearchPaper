 Resource value assessment in which competitors adjust behaviours according to the perceived value of a contested resource is well described in animal contests . Such assessment is usually assumed to be categorical or linear for example males fight more aggressively when females are present than absent or as female fecundity increases . Here to our knowledge for the first time we show quadratic resource value assessment in which resource value is highest at a certain level and decreases in either direction . The mantis shrimp

@highlight Mantis shrimp inhabit protective coral rubble burrows in a size assortative manner.
@highlight Intruders without burrows won fights over burrows smaller than the predicted ideal size.
@highlight Intruders won by delivering more high force strikes and by being aggressive first.
@highlight Burrow residents showed no evidence of burrow size assessment.
@highlight The quadratic resource value assessment we describe may inform other systems.
