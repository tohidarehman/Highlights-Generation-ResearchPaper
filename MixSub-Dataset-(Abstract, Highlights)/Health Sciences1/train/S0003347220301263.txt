 Parasitoids need to find their plant feeding hosts in complex environments that contain multiple other plant and insect species . They usually rely on herbivore induced plant volatiles to locate herbivore infested plants from a distance and their foraging efficiency may be reduced when volatile information is not available . Downwind foraging during times when high wind speeds prevent odour guided upwind flights may create foraging situations with limited accessibiliy to volatile information . We hypothesized that parasitoids forage less efficiently by landing on nonhost damaged or undamaged plants when they are forced to fly downwind and tested this in a wind tunnel experiment . We released the parasitoid

@highlight Downwind flying parasitoids foraged less efficiently than upwind flying parasitoids.
@highlight Upwind flying parasitoids had access to HIPVs from all herbivore infested plants.
@highlight Low HIPV availability reduced between plant movement of downwind flying parasitoids.
@highlight Downwind flying parasitoids foraged more intensively on nonhost infested plants.
@highlight Intensive foraging on nonhost infested plants delayed host finding.
