 The sexes may have different optima in cognitive traits due to differences in life history strategies and the expense of investing in metabolically costly brain tissue . However given genetic correlations each sex could be constrained from reaching its cognitive optimum due to intralocus sexual conflict . We compared learning performance of two male alternative reproductive tactics and females from known genotypes in the livebearing fish

@highlight Swordtail fish showed tactical and sexual dimorphism in learning performance.
@highlight There was no evidence for a genetic correlation across the sexes for learning.
@highlight This suggests no intralocus sexual conflict on investment in cognition.
@highlight Maternal effects on the slower learning tactic may mitigate genetic correlation.
@highlight Our results support the presence of direct selection on female cognitive traits.
