 Collective movement is critical to the survival of some animals . Despite substantial progress in understanding animal collectives such as fish shoals and bird flocks it is unknown how collective behaviour is affected by changes in multiple environmental conditions that can interact as stressors . Using a fully factorial repeated measures design we tested the independent and combined effects of darkness and acoustic noise on the collective motion of three spined sticklebacks

@highlight How do different environmental stressors interact to affect collective behaviour 
@highlight We tested shoals of sticklebacks manipulating darkness and additional noise.
@highlight These stressors act independently and on different aspects of collective motion.
@highlight Shoals were more spaced apart and less coordinated in darkness.
@highlight Shoal structure was altered by additional noise.
