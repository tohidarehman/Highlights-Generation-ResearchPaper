 Wind is an important yet understudied environmental influence on foraging behaviour . We investigated the direct and indirect effects of wind on foraging worker honey bees

@highlight The effects of wind on the foraging behaviour of honey bee workers were tested.
@highlight Foraging rate significantly decreased in higher wind speeds.
@highlight This was due to increased hesitancy to take off.
@highlight Flower movement independent of wind had no effect on foraging rate.
@highlight Wind significantly reduces honey bee foraging efficiency.
