 Two algorithms for explaining decisions of a lung cancer computer aided diagnosis system are proposed . Their main peculiarity is that they produce explanations of diseases in the form of special sentences via natural language . The algorithms consist of two parts . The first part is a standard local post hoc explanation model for example the well known LIME which is used for selecting important features from a special feature representation of the segmented lung suspicious objects . This part is identical for both algorithms . The second part is a model which aims to connect selected important features and to transform them to explanation sentences in natural language . This part is implemented differently for both algorithms . The training phase of the first algorithm uses a special vocabulary of simple phrases which produce sentences and their embeddings . The second algorithm significantly simplifies some parts of the first algorithm and reduces the explanation problem to a set of simple classifiers . The basic idea behind the improvement is to represent every simple phrase from vocabulary as a class of the sparse histograms . An implementation of the second algorithm is shown in detail .

@highlight Two algorithms of the lung cancer CADx system explanation is proposed.
@highlight The explanation is implemented via natural language.
@highlight A low dimensional feature representation of CT lung nodule images is considered to simplify classification and explanation.
@highlight An efficient explanation method is based on using a set of simple classifiers which provide short phrases as classes.
