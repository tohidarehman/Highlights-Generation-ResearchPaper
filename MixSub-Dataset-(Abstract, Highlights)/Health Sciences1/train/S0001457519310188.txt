 Pedestrians must use a variety of visual and auditory cues when determining safe crossing opportunities . Although vision has received a bulk of the attention in research on pedestrian safety the examination of both vision and audition are important to consider . Environmental intrapersonal and cognitive qualities of a pedestrian context may limit the use of one or both perceptual modalities . Across two experiments we examined the impact of perceptual constraints on pedestrian safety by measuring the accuracy of vehicle time to arrival estimates in a virtual environment when vehicles were only visible only audible or both visible and audible . In both experiments participants estimated the time to arrival of vehicles moving at one of two speeds . In the second experiment we introduced ambient traffic noises to examine the impact of environmentally relevant traffic noises on pedestrian perception . Results suggest seeing a vehicle is more advantageous than hearing a vehicle when interacting with traffic especially in the presence of ambient sound . Both experiments resulted in more accurate time to arrival estimates in the visual and mixed conditions than in the auditory only condition . Implications for pedestrian safety and future research are discussed .

@highlight Perceptual modality is a vital part of pedestrian safety.
@highlight Time to arrival judgements of approaching vehicles are less accurate when pedestrians do not have access to visual stimuli.
@highlight Ambient sound reduces accuracy of vehicle time to arrival judgements when pedestrians do not have access to visual stimuli.
