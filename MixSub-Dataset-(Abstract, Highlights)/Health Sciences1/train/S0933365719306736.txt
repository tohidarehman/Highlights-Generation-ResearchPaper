 The DESIREE project has developed a platform offering several complementary therapeutic decision support modules to improve the quality of care for breast cancer patients . All modules are operating consistently with a common breast cancer knowledge model following the generic entity attribute value model . The BCKM is formalized as an ontology including both the data model to represent clinical patient information and the termino ontological model to represent the application domain concepts . This ontological model is used to describe data semantics and to allow for reasoning at different levels of abstraction . We present the guideline based decision support module . Three breast cancer clinical practice guidelines have been formalized as decision rules including evidence levels conformance levels and two types of dependency refinement and complement used to build complete care plans from the reconciliation of atomic recommendations . The system has been assessed on 138 decisions previously made without the system and re played with the system after a washout period on simulated tumor boards in three pilot sites . When TB clinicians changed their decision after using the GL DSS it was for a better decision than the decision made without the system in 75 of the cases .

@highlight We developed a guideline based decision support system for breast cancer management.
@highlight Both data and terminological models integrate within a unique ontological framework.
@highlight The knowledge base includes three different contemporary breast cancer guidelines.
@highlight Intra guideline reconciliation is performed to build recommended care plans.
@highlight Tumor board physicians assessed the usability and clinical validity of the system.
