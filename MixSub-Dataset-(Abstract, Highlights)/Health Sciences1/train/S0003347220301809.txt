 During aggression animals signal their physical abilities to deter opponents from fighting . Competitors that have a coevolved system of communication can resolve the outcome of a fight without paying the cost of engaging in potentially injurious fighting . Invasive species complicate the dynamics of competition because such species may not have a coevolved system of communication . For example many species of crayfish have invaded freshwater ecosystems where they compete with species never encountered before . We studied the traits used to escalate aggression within and between two species of invasive crayfish in Arizona

@highlight We studied traits used to escalate aggression in two species of invasive crayfish.
@highlight Both species escalated and resolved disputes using their claws as signals.
@highlight Claw size determined the outcome of interactions that escalated to physical combat.
@highlight Species ability to communicate with competitors may affect invasive potential.
