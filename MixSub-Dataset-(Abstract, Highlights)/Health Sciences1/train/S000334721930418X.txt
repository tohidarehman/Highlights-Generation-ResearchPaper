 Scent marking where individuals deposit signals on objects in the environment is a common form of chemical signalling in mammals and is thought to play a critical role in maintaining social organization within wide ranging spatially dispersed populations . Senders however can incur scent marking costs through mark production time investment in patrolling and depositing maintaining mark sites and increased risk of detection by predators and prey . To mitigate these costs senders can adapt spatial patterns of scent marking to increase the probabilities of their scent marks being encountered by intended receivers . Relatively little however is known of the spatial scent marking placements of many wide ranging carnivore species with most studies focusing on scent mark form and function . Here we used detailed observational data collected from over 7 years of following individual leopards

@highlight Species can use spatial scent marking strategies to facilitate communication.
@highlight Leopards showed higher investment in maintaining scent marks at home range boundaries.
@highlight Communication behaviours are impacted by human modifications to the environment.
@highlight Leopards are highly flexible in their scent marking strategies.
@highlight GPS and focal data can provide greater insights into cryptic species behaviours.
