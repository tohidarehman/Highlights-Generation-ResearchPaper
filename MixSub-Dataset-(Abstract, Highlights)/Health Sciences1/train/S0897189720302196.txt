 Many professional athletes after the end of their careers can not fully carry out daily social activities due to problems with health . The main problem is a significant rate of cardiovascular diseases . Therefore the choice of rehabilitation techniques for former athletes is of primary importance . The aim of the paper is to create a model that increases the ability to predict both relapses and remissions during rehabilitation in cardiovascular diseases . The model takes into account the features of the cardiovascular function in athletes and their recovery . The article shows that the reliability of the implemented model can predict both necessary rehabilitation duration and time to complete recovery of an athlete s functional condition . The novelty of this study is that rehabilitation is based on the approximation of exercise load to the optimal levels during disease monitoring . The practical significance of the study is that during the rehabilitation of athletes the obtained model to predict the course of the disease is aimed at the minimization of negative consequences for the athlete s cardiovascular system following professional activities . This model is recommended for use in medical prediction .

@highlight Experiments were different resulted in model parameters 
@highlight A prediction method during rehabilitation process is proposed.
