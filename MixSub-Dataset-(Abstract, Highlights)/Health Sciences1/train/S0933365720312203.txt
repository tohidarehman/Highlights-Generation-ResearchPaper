 Cardiac magnetic resonance quantitative T1 mapping is increasingly used for advanced myocardial tissue characterisation . However cardiac or respiratory motion can significantly affect the diagnostic utility of T1 maps and thus motion artefact detection is critical for quality control and clinically robust T1 measurements . Manual quality control of T1 maps may provide reassurance but is laborious and prone to error . We present a deep learning approach with attention supervision for automated motion artefact detection in quality control of cardiac T1 mapping . Firstly we customised a multi stream Convolutional Neural Network image classifier to streamline the process of automatic motion artefact detection . Secondly we imposed attention supervision to guide the CNN to focus on targeted myocardial segments . Thirdly when there was disagreement between the human operator and machine a second human validator reviewed and rescored the cases for adjudication and to identify the source of disagreement . The multi stream neural networks demonstrated 89.8 agreement 87.4 ROC AUC on motion artefact detection with the human operator in the 2568 T1 maps . Trained with additional supervision on attention agreements and AUC significantly improved to 91.5 and 89.1 respectively . Rescoring of disagreed cases by the second human validator revealed that human operator error was the primary cause of disagreement . Deep learning with attention supervision provides a quick and high quality assurance of clinical images and outperforms human operators .
