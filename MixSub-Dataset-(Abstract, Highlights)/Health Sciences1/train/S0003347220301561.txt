 The human assisted movement of species beyond their native range facilitates novel interactions between invaders and native species that can determine whether an introduced species becomes invasive and the nature of any consequences for native communities . Avoiding costly interactions through recognition and avoidance can be compromised by the navety of native species to novel invaders and vice versa . We tested this hypothesis using the common wall lizard

@highlight We test response to scent cues in mediating native non native lizard interactions.
@highlight Native species differed in their response to scent cues from the invading species.
@highlight Non native lizards responded more towards cues of the most distantly related native.
@highlight Behavioural response to scent cues may determine interactions and invasion impacts.
