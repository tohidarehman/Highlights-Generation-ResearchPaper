 This study contrasted the performance of drivers under actual and simulated driving conditions in order to assess the validity of the simulators and test the hypothesis that driving is composed of largely orthogonal sub tasks . Thirty experienced drivers completed an on road driving test and drove two different simulators each simulator drive comprising seven difficulty moderated driving scenarios . Between simulator contrasts revealed largely absolute validity the anticipated effects of increased difficulty within driving scenarios but weak relationships between performance of different driving scenarios . On road driving was reliably assessed by a nationally recognised expert driving assessor as reflected by standard statistical measures of reliability and consistency . However on road driving revealed relatively little cross category correlation of on road driving errors or between on road and simulator driving . Thus despite the compelling evidence of absolute and relative validity within and between simulators there is little evidence of criterion validity . Moreover the study provides strong evidence for orthogonality in the driving task driving comprises large numbers of relatively separate tasks .

@highlight We report an in depth study which seeks to validate simulators against each other and on road driving
@highlight In doing so we provide a methodological and theoretical context which might influence other approaches to validation
@highlight We report strong evidence of both absolute and relative validity
@highlight In addition for the first time we offer clear evidence for modularity within the driving task based on the orthogonality of different aspects of the driving task.
