 Social interactions can shape daily activity patterns and this is an area of growing research interest . The propensity for individuals to be active at certain times of day may structure interactions with competitors and potential mates influencing fitness outcomes . Aspects of daily activity such as timing of activity onset and offset exhibit within individual repeatability which raises the possibility that they may be subject to natural and sexual selection . This study used a biologging approach in free living Arctic ground squirrels

@highlight Arctic ground squirrels showed evidence of circadian chronotypes.
@highlight Activity onset and offset differed by sex especially during mating and lactation.
@highlight Activity onset reflected life history energetics rather than sexual selection.
@highlight Repeatability estimates were affected by sampling frequency and design.
