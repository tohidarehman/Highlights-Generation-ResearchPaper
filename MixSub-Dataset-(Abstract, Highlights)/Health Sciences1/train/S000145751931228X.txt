 Excessive alcohol use especially binge drinking is an important risk factor for unintentional and intentional injuries . This study used hospital discharge data to estimate the prevalence and trends of treatments for alcohol related injury in Minnesota and discussed opportunities and challenges for public health surveillance . We examined hospital treated ARI in Minnesota between 2000 and 2015 using HDD . ARI was defined as hospital discharges with an injury diagnosis and a diagnosis related to alcohol in any diagnosis field . The number of hospital treated injuries increased by 30 between 2000 and 2015 . The number of those injuries that were alcohol related increased by 166 from 2000 to 2015 . ARI were more likely to be treated as inpatients than all injuriesin 2015 34 of ARI were inpatient compared to 17 of all injuries . Patients treated for ARI were more likely to be male and older than the average injury patient . In 2015 ARI were more likely than all injuries to be self inflicted related to assault and less likely to be unintentional . These analyses suggest that the rate of hospital treated ARI increased more steeply from 2000 to 2015 than all injuries . While there are significant challenges to using HDD for surveillance further work to assess the validity of the data source is warranted .
