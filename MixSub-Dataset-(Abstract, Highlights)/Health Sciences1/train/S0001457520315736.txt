 Inexperienced drivers have a higher crash risk than others particularly at night when drivers of all ages are at increased risk but there has been little if any research on day night differences in drivers perceptions of risk and difficulty . Also previous research on determinants of risk and difficulty ratings has focused largely on effects of vehicle speed and researchers have identified a need to look more broadly at how ratings are affected by the complexity of depicted road traffic situations .

@highlight Young drivers varying in experience and age rated videos for risk and difficulty.
@highlight Ratings were higher for night time videos than daytime ones.
@highlight Ratings appeared to be influenced by the required rate of information processing.
@highlight Risk and difficulty were highly correlated but empirically distinct variables.
@highlight Neither driving experience nor age affected ratings.
