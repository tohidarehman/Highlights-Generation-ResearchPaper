 Examining the spatial relationships among crashes of various severity levels is essential for gaining a better understanding of the severity distribution and potential contributing factors to collisions . However relatively few scholars have focused on analyzing this type of data . Therefore in this study we utilized a new index the colocation quotient to measure the spatial associations among crashes of various severities that occurred in College Station Texas . This new method has been widely used to define the colocation pattern of categorized data in various fields but it has not yet been applied to crash severity data . According to our findings crashes tended to be at the same injury level as those of neighboring ones which was most significant for fatal crashes and second most significant for non injury crashes the colocation quotient matrix tended to be symmetrical in non injury crashes versus injury crashes and DWIs and hit and runs did not show a strong pattern . These colocation quotient results could be helpful for predicting crash severity and by providing traffic engineers with more effective traffic safety measures .
