 After admission to emergency department patients with critical illnesses are transferred to intensive care unit due to unexpected clinical deterioration occurrence . Identifying such unplanned ICU transfers is urgently needed for medical physicians to achieve two fold goals improving critical care quality and preventing mortality . A priority task is to understand the crucial rationale behind diagnosis results of individual patients during stay in ED which helps prepare for an early transfer to ICU . Most existing prediction studies were based on univariate analysis or multiple logistic regression to provide one size fit all results . However patient condition varying from case to case may not be accurately examined by such a simplistic judgment . In this study we present a new decision tool using a mathematical optimization approach aiming to automatically discover rules associating diagnostic features with high risk outcome in different deterioration scenarios . We consider four mutually exclusive patient subgroups based on the principal reasons of ED visits infections cardiovascular respiratory diseases gastrointestinal diseases and neurological other diseases at a suburban teaching hospital . The analysis results demonstrate significant rules associated with unplanned transfer outcome for each subgroups and also show comparable prediction accuracy

@highlight Early identifying unplanned transfer to intensive care unit from emergency department due to unexpected clinical deteriorations is formulated as a supervised learning problem.
@highlight A new rule based analytic method using optimization and data mining is developed.
@highlight Significant association rules of key risk factors resulting in high risk unplanned transfers are formed.
@highlight The developed method provides easy to interpret results beneficial for supporting clinical decisions.
