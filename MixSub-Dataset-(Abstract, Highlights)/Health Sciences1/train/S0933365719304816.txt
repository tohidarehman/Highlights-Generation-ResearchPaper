 A subject of extensive research interest in the Brain Computer Interfaces niche is motor imagery where users imagine limb movements to control the system . This interest is owed to the immense potential for its applicability in gaming neuro prosthetics and neuro rehabilitation where the users thoughts of imagined movements need to be decoded . Electroencephalography equipment is commonly used for keeping track of cerebrum movement in BCI systems . The EEG signals are recognized by feature extraction and classification . The current research proposes a Hybrid KELM method based on PCA and FLD for MI BCI classification of EEG data . The performance and results of the method are demonstrated using BCI competition dataset III and compared with those of contemporary methods . The proposed method generated an accuracy of 96.54 .

@highlight A Braisn Computer Interface BCI framework depend on motor imagery MI recognizes templates of electrical cerebrum movement.
@highlight Principal Component Analysis PCA is used toward to minimize the high dimensionality raw facts into lower dimensional data.
@highlight BCI competition dataset III is used in proposed work.
