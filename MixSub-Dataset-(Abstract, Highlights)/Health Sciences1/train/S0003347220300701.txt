 Inference by exclusion or the ability to select a correct course of action by systematically excluding other potential alternatives is a form of logical inference that allows individuals to solve problems without complete information . Current comparative research shows that several bird mammal and primate species can find hidden food through inference by exclusion . Yet there is also wide variation in how successful different species are as well as the kinds of sensory information they can use to do so . An important question is therefore why some species are better at engaging in logical inference than others . Here we investigate the evolution of logical reasoning abilities by comparing strepsirrhine primate species that vary in dietary ecology frugivorous ruffed lemurs

@highlight Species vary in capacities for logical inference such as inference by exclusion.
@highlight We tested how two lemur species with different ecologies solve such problems.
@highlight Lemurs were more successful using visual than auditory information to find food.
@highlight Lemurs made inferences from direct information but not via exclusion.
@highlight Only frugivorous ruffed lemurs exploited both sensory modalities.
