 Bayesian networks have received increasing research attention that is not matched by adoption in practice and yet have potential to significantly benefit healthcare . Hitherto research works have not investigated the types of medical conditions being modelled with BNs nor whether there are any differences in how and why they are applied to different conditions . This research seeks to identify and quantify the range of medical conditions for which healthcare related BN models have been proposed and the differences in approach between the most common medical conditions to which they have been applied . We found that almost two thirds of all healthcare BNs are focused on four conditions cardiac cancer psychological and lung disorders . We believe there is a lack of understanding regarding how BNs work and what they are capable of and that it is only with greater understanding and promotion that we may ever realise the full potential of BNs to effect positive change in daily healthcare practice .

@highlight A review which identifies the medical conditions for which contemporary literature on Bayesian networks BNs have been focused.
@highlight Finds that most attention has gone towards four primary health conditions.
@highlight Identifies differences in the approaches used by authors between each of the four primary health conditions.
@highlight Contributes to our understanding of how and what BNs are being considered for in healthcare.
