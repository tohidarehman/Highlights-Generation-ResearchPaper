 Transportation agencies utilize Active traffic management systems to dynamically manage recurrent and non recurrent congestion based on real time conditions . While these systems have been shown to have some safety benefits their impact on injury severity outcomes is currently uncertain . This paper used full Bayesian mixed logit models to quantify the impact that ATM deployment had on crash severities . The estimation results revealed lower severities with ATM deployment . Marginal effects for ATM deployments that featured hard shoulder running revealed lower likelihoods for severe and moderate injury crashes of 15.9 and for minor injury crashes of 10.1 . The likelihood of severe and moderate injury crashes and minor injury crashes reduced by 12.4 and 8.33 with ATM without HSR . The models were observed to be temporally transferable and had forecast error of 0.301 and 0.304 for the two models revealing better performance with validation data . These results have implications for improving freeway crash risk at critical locations .

@highlight Crash Severity effects of Active Traffic Management ATM systems were assessed.
@highlight A Bayesian modeling framework for mixed logit models with random parameters was proposed.
@highlight Model results revealed a reduction of 12.4 and 15.9 for ATM with and without hard shoulder running. The models were observed to be temporally transferable.
