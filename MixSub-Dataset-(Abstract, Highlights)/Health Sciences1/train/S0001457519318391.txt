 Both crash count and severity are thought to quantify crash risk at defined transport network locations . Crash count is a measure of the likelihood of occurring a potential harmful event whereas crash severity is a measure of the societal impact and harm to the society . As the majority of safety improvement programs are focused on preventing fatal and serious injury crashes identification of high risk sitesor blackspotsshould ideally account for both severity and frequency of crashes . Past research efforts to incorporate crash severity into the identification of high risk sites include multivariate crash count models equivalent property damage only models and two stage mixed models . These models however often require suitable distributional assumptions for computational efficiency neglect the ordinal nature of crash severity and are inadequate for capturing unobserved heterogeneity arising from possible correlations between crash counts of different severity levels . These limitations can ultimately lead to inefficient allocation of resources and misidentification of sites with high risk of fatal and serious injury crashes . Moreover the implication of these models in blackspot identification is an important unanswered question .

@highlight Incorporation of crash severity into crash count improves the accuracy of crash count prediction.
@highlight Correlation between crash counts of different severities captures unobserved heterogeneity by extra variation in crash counts.
@highlight A new weighted risk score metric is proposed to aggregate crash counts by severity levels at a site.
@highlight The weighted risk score approach identifies higher number of fatal and serious injury crashes in the blackspots.
