 Animals can transfer food between each other through both competition and cooperation . Analysing patterns of food transfers can thus yield valuable insights into animals social dynamics e.g . intragroup competition and cooperation . Previous studies on food transfers in our closest living relatives the great apes have mainly focused on ultimate explanations for food sharing and analysed food transfers as independent events with a focus on frequencies and types of transfers . In this study we focus on the influence of contextual variables and the directly preceding interaction on food transfer attempts . We provided one monopolizable food bag per session to orang utans housed in the same enclosure

@highlight Orang utans flexibly used cooperative and competitive strategies to transfer food.
@highlight Proximate mechanisms explain changes in strategies delays success and resistance.
@highlight Food transfers within a dyad were not independent events.
@highlight Food transfers were influenced by the preceding interaction within each dyad.
@highlight These results reveal orang utans cognitive flexibility and relational intelligence.
