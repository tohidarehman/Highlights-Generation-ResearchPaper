 Risk perception plays an important role in driver behaviour particularly for speed choice . Risk perception studies use a range of techniques from on road data collection to ratings of still photos however participants ratings differ depending on the study methodology possibly due to their perception of control . To explore this we conducted a multiple methods study to investigate drivers perceptions of risk on rural roads . One group of participants drove a 180km route along rural roads and provided verbal risk ratings at thirteen locations of interest . A second group provided ratings at the same points when travelling as a passenger in a vehicle . The third group were shown videos of the same rural roads and also provided risk ratings at the same locations . A week later participants were invited to the laboratory to review the video footage and comment on factors that contributed to the risk ratings . Overall the Observers gave the highest risk ratings and Drivers the lowest . The Observers also provided twice the number of comments to justify their risk rating compared to the other two groups . The results suggest that control and on road experience play a significant role in how perceptions of driving risk are formed and the degree of risk experienced . These findings also bring into question the accuracy of using video based tasks to assess drivers risk perception particularly if the findings are used to inform on road safety interventions .

@highlight Risk perception is important in driver behaviour and is influenced by perceived control.
@highlight Drivers Passengers and Observers rated the risk at 13 locations on rural roads.
@highlight Observers gave the highest risk ratings and Drivers the lowest.
@highlight Risk ratings from video based tasks do not reflect on road ratings.
