 Anthropogenic noise is increasing in intensity and scope raising concern over its effects on wildlife populations . Laboratory studies suggest that exposure to elevated noise can interfere with the development of a young animal s ability to process social signals and ultimately its ability to communicate as an adult . Whether such effects occur in nature is unknown however . Here we present the first field experiments examining whether elevated noise affects the development of the ability to discriminate the vocalizations of different conspecifics . We exposed nestling tree swallows to white noise during development and then tested in both quiet and noisy conditions whether they could discriminate their parents provisioning calls and their nestmates begging calls from those of other individuals . We predicted that noise would interfere with discrimination because previous work showed that it decreased nestling detection of adult calls ostensibly an easier task . Instead noise had no discernible effect on discrimination of parental and nestmate calls even though it reduced overall responses to adult calls as shown previously . While our results show no long term disruptive effect of noise on development they also show no adjustments to sustained noise that might help nestlings better cope with noisy conditions .

@highlight In the lab noise can disrupt development of auditory skills needed later in life.
@highlight In the first field test for such disruptions we exposed developing nestlings to noise.
@highlight We then tested their responses to the calls of their own vs other parents and broods.
@highlight Noise had no clear effect on how well nestlings could discriminate these calls.
@highlight Conversely noise reared nestlings showed no adjustments to better cope with noise.
