 Cryptic interactions among individuals in animal societies can be challenging to detect due to their rarity or their covert nature but they can have important fitness consequences for the individuals involved . Using radiofrequency identification technology we examined the pattern and function of visits to the nests of conspecifics in western bluebirds

@highlight We documented visits made by songbirds to the nests of conspecifics.
@highlight Some visits made by males were consistent with seeking extrapair copulations.
@highlight Some visits were consistent with prospecting for future nest sites or mates.
@highlight Males biased visits towards kin even outside of a helping context.
@highlight Extraterritorial visits likely have multiple functions.
