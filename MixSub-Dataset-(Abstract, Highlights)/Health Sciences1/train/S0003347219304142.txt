 Geographical variation has been widely studied in oscine songbirds with particular attention paid to the interplay between variables associated with learned song and dispersal . While most field based studies have focused on discrete dialects analysing data from quickly growing citizen science libraries could uncover geographical patterns in species previously thought to exhibit random variation in song . Specifically using citizen science birdsong databases we test whether chipping sparrow

@highlight Citizen science data revealed long range geographical patterns in song features.
@highlight Chipping sparrow song rate and frequency varied with longitude but not latitude.
@highlight Despite early song matching diverse song types persisted across the species range.
@highlight Song and genetic variation were not correlated suggesting a complex life history.
