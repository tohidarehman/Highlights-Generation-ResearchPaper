 Flexibility in foraging behaviour is a key individual trait promoting adaptive responses to changing environmental conditions . Such flexibility can be especially pronounced in marine predators that forage in highly dynamic environments and pursue ephemeral and patchily distributed prey . Individual characteristics social interactions and resource availability may all promote behavioural flexibility which in turn may foster divergence in foraging tactics within populations . The adoption of specific foraging tactics by individuals from the same population could be driven by a complex mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic factors . We GPS tracked chick rearing parents of a sexually size dimorphic avian marine top predator the Scopolis shearwater

@highlight Breeding shearwaters performed foraging trips with diverse food searching behaviour.
@highlight Trips were classified as mainly involving coarse scale or fine scale foraging.
@highlight Coarse scale trips were mostly performed by females and with strong wind conditions.
@highlight Sex differences were likely related to sex differences in morphology.
@highlight Sex specific foraging tactics could buffer intersexual competition for resources.
