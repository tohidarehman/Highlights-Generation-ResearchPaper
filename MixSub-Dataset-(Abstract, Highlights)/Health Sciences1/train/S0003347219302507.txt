 Niko Tinbergen characterized ethology as the biological study of behaviour involving four kinds of question causation ontogeny adaptive function and phyletic evolution Tinbergen 1963

@highlight I provide a historical perspective of Tinbergen and his four questions of ethology.
@highlight Namely that of causation ontogeny adaptive function and phyletic evolution.
@highlight Tinbergen insisted that each question be given equal attention.
@highlight That requirement continues to present an agenda for ethological aspiration.
