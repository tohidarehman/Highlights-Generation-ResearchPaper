 Australian drivers aged 1725 years are overrepresented in road crashes with many crashes resulting from smartphone use . The current study based on a prospective design and an extended TPB framework predicted young drivers intentions to and actual behaviour of monitoring reading social interactive technology via a smartphone while driving . An online survey at Time 1 assessed the TPB constructs of attitude subjective norm and perceived behaviour control and the additional factors of habit mindfulness and cognitive capture . A hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that the TPB constructs accounted for 76.4 in the variance of young drivers intentions . The extended model which included habit mindfulness and cognitive capture accounted for a significant 79 of the variance in intention and these additional factors explained a significant amount of variance over and above the TPB constructs . The Time 2 survey assessed actual behaviour in relation to smartphone use in the one week period between the Time 1 and 2 surveys . Results from a multiple regression analysis of Time 2 found that as expected intention was a significant predictor of the behaviour of monitoring reading a smartphone while driving . The results support the TPB for predicting intention and actual behaviour in relation to monitoring reading a smartphone while driving . The theoretical and practical implications of the current study are discussed as well as recommendations for future research .

@highlight The TPB was significant when predicting both intention and behaviour
@highlight Habit mindfulness and cognitive capture were significant predictors of intention
@highlight Intention was the only significant predictor of behaviour
