 This study compared pedestrian behaviors in five countries and investigated the relationships between these behaviors and values in each country . The study participants were 131 pedestrians for Estonia 249 for Greece 112 for Kosovo 176 for Russia and 145 for Turkey . The principal component analyses revealed that the four factor structure of the Pedestrian Behavior Scale was highly consistent across the five countries . ANCOVA results revealed significant differences between countries on the PBS items and scale scores . Specifically Greek and Turkish participants reported transgressive pedestrian behaviors more frequently than Estonian Kosovar and Russian pedestrians while Kosovar participants reported transgressive pedestrian behaviors less frequently than Estonian pedestrians . In addition Turkish and Russian pedestrians reported lapses and aggressive behaviors more frequently than Estonian Greek and Kosovar pedestrians . Finally Turkish and Estonian pedestrians reported positive behaviors more frequently than Kosovar pedestrians . Unexpectedly the regression analyses showed that values have varying effects on pedestrian behavior in the five countries . That is context or country may determine the effect of values on pedestrian behaviors . The results are discussed in relation to the previous literature .
