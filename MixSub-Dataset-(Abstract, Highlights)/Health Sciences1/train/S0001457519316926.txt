 Provisional drivers do not always comply with graduated driver licensing restrictions and road laws . The aim of this study was to explore the effect of parenting style on young driver compliance with licensing restrictions . Two surveys the first a sample of parents of provisionally licensed drivers from Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory while the second and separate sample was of provisionally licensed drivers from Queensland . A series of regression analyses identified that parents who reported higher levels of control were more likely to feel responsible for their childs driving and to have a child that complied with licensing restrictions . Parents who reported higher levels of support were more likely to offer their child practical assistance in order to help them to comply with licensing restrictions . Young drivers who reported that their parents had higher levels of control were more likely to indicate that they complied with restrictions . Given that parenting style appears to influence provisional driver compliance with licensing requirements there may be an opportunity to develop interventions to enhance compliance .
