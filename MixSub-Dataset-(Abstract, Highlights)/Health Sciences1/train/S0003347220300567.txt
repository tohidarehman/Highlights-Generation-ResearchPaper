 Certain behavioural traits including innovation and reduced neophobia may facilitate successful invasions by allowing first arrivals to overcome the challenges of a novel environment . However the extent to which these traits occur in invasive populations in comparison with native populations and whether these traits prevalence remains consistent throughout a species introduced range have been scarcely investigated . We tested whether object neophobia food neophobia and two levels of motor innovation in the common myna

@highlight We measured neophobia and innovation in native and invasive common mynas.
@highlight Individuals from the invasion front were the most motorically innovative.
@highlight Individuals from the invasive range were more tolerant of a novel food.
@highlight The frequency of these phenotypes decreased as the environment became familiar.
@highlight We provide empirical evidence to support the adaptive flexibility hypothesis.
