 This project used the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System tools to evaluate heart failure patient s experiences of dyspnea fatigue and physical mobility during initiation and up titration of drugs in an outpatient setting . Investigating patient reported outcome may improve adherence to GDMT . Theoretical support for this study is found in the University of California Theory of Symptom Management . Exploratory repeated measures design . Patients completed three PROMIS questionnaires for dyspnea fatigue and physical mobility when GDMT was started or up titrated and again at a follow up appointment within 30days of the baseline measures . Patients were asked open ended queries regarding the usefulness of these questionnaires in identifying and managing symptoms . Provider input was sought on usefulness of the tools in clinical practice and decision making . Dyspnea change scores significantly decreased Dyspnea and physical mobility improved with up titration of GDMT but fatigue did not change . PROMIS tools could be helpful in tracking selected symptom changes during GDMT HF medication initiation or up titration for HF management if reformulated into shorter format .

@highlight Building understanding about patient related outcomes PRO is postulated to promote optimal symptom management for patients with heart failure HF .
@highlight The results of this preliminary study demonstrated that patients could easily self report symptom changes using the PROMIS 
@highlight  for dyspnea fatigue and physical mobility
@highlight Symptom change scores for dyspnea and physical mobility significantly improved when initiating or up titrating goal directed medication therapy GDMT HF medications but fatigue scores did not significantly change.
@highlight Providers felt that while the tools were easy for patients to understand and use they were too time consuming in their current form and could slow down the flow of patient care in the office setting
