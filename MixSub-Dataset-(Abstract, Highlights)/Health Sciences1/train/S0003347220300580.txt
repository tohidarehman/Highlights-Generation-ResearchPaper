 Many crustaceans use their large claws to signal fighting ability during territorial contests . However the size of a claw does not always reflect its strength or the bearer s ability to fight . If strength predicts the outcome of a fight the mismatch between the size and strength of a claw creates dishonest signalling . Still only a handful of species have been studied leaving a gap in our knowledge of the taxonomic diversity and evolutionary history of dishonest signalling . To help fill this gap we studied signalling and fighting between virile crayfish

@highlight Crustaceans produce large but weak claws as dishonest signals of their strength.
@highlight Crayfish did not use large weak claws as signals during territorial aggression.
@highlight Other traits such as body size likely determine outcomes of aggressive communication.
