 Road crashes impose an important burden on health and the economy . Numerous efforts have been undertaken to understand the factors that affect road collisions in general and the severity of crashes in particular . In this literature several strategies have been proposed to model interactions between parties in a crash including the use of variables regarding the other party in the collision data subsetting and estimating models with hierarchical components . Since no systematic assessment has been conducted of the performance of these strategies they appear to be used in an ad hoc fashion in the literature . The objective of this paper is to empirically evaluate ways to model party interactions in the context of crashes involving two parties . To this end a series of models are estimated using data from Canada s National Collision Database . Three levels of crash severity are analyzed using ordered probit models and covariates for the parties in the crash and the conditions of the crash . The models are assessed using predicted shares and classes of outcomes and the results highlight the importance of considering opponent effects in crash severity analysis . The study also suggests that hierarchical specifications and subsetting do not necessarily perform better than a relatively simple single level model with opponent related factors . The results of this study provide insights regarding the performance of different modelling strategies and should be informative to researchers in the field of crash severity .
