 The effect of ambient light level on road traffic collisions involving a motorcycle was investigated . Data were drawn from the STATS19 database of UK reported RTCs for the period 20052015 . To isolate the effect of ambient light an odds ratio was used to compare RTCs at specific times of day in the weeks either side of the Spring and Autumn clock changes . This work extended previous studies by using a more precise method for distinguishing between RTCs in daylight and after dark thus avoiding the ambiguity of twilight . Data for four wheel motor vehicle RTCs were also investigated to provide a datum . As expected the risk of an RTC occurring was significantly higher after dark compared to daylight for both motorcycles and FWMVs . Investigation of contextual factors suggests that risk after dark is significantly higher for motorcycles compared to FWMVs for RTCs with two vehicles on roads with low speed limits at T junctions and junctions controlled by a give way sign . These are the situations where visual aids for increasing conspicuity after dark have the greater potential for reducing motorcycle RTCs .

@highlight The effect of ambient light level on motorcycle collisions was investigated.
@highlight A more precise method for distinguishing between RTCs in daylight or dark was used than past studies.
@highlight This suggests darkness is of greater detriment than suggested in past studies.
@highlight There is increased risk at T junctions and at give way controlled junctions.
