 Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and the second most frequent overall after lung cancer . Although the 5 year survival rate of breast cancer is relatively high recurrence is also common which often involves metastasis with its consequent threat for patients . DNA methylation derived databases have become an interesting primary source for supervised knowledge extraction regarding breast cancer . Unfortunately the study of DNA methylation involves the processing of hundreds of thousands of features for every patient . DNA methylation is featured by High Dimension Low Sample Size which has shown well known issues regarding feature selection and generation . Autoencoders appear as a specific technique for conducting nonlinear feature fusion . Our main objective in this work is to design a procedure to summarize DNA methylation by taking advantage of AEs . Our proposal is able to generate new features from the values of CpG sites of patients with and without recurrence . Then a limited set of relevant genes to characterize breast cancer recurrence is proposed by the application of survival analysis and a pondered ranking of genes according to the distribution of their CpG sites . To test our proposal we have selected a dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal and an AE with a single hidden layer . The literature and enrichment analysis conducted regarding the genes obtained with our experiment confirmed that all of these genes were related to breast cancer recurrence .
