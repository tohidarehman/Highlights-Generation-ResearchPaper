 A major challenge in gene regulatory networks of biological systems is to discover when and what interventions should be applied to shift them to healthy phenotypes . A set of gene activity profiles called basin of attraction takes this network to a specific phenotype therefore a healthy BOA leads the GRN to a healthy phenotype . However without the complete observability of the genes it is not possible to identify whether the current BOA is healthy . In this article we investigate external interventions in GRN with partial observability aiming to bring it to healthy BOAs . We propose a new batch reinforcement learning method called mSFQI to define intervention strategies based on the probabilities of the gene activity profiles being in healthy BOAs which are calculated from a set of previous observed experiences . BRL uses approximation functions and repeated applications of previous experiences to accelerate learning . Results demonstrate that our proposal can quickly shift a partially observable GRN to healthy BOAs while reducing the number of interventions . In addition when observability is poor mSFQI produces better results when the probabilities for a greater amount of previous observations are available .

@highlight Considers the problem of shifting gene regulatory networks to desirable basins of attraction.
@highlight Novel framework has been developed for intervening through batch reinforcement learning techniques.
@highlight mSFQI uses information regarding previous observations to deal with partial observability.
@highlight Results show that our framework decreases the number of interventions applied.
