 It is widely accepted that hunger state and food availability affect mating behaviour . Hunger state decreases mating activity because of a trade off between foraging and mating behaviour except for the cases where females obtain material benefit from mating and therefore increase copulation rate when they are starved . Similarly food availability is believed to increase the copulation rate . However the interaction between hunger state and food availability has rarely been demonstrated . It is empirically known that

@highlight Starvation increased the copulation rate of
@highlight This effect was observed only when food was available.
@highlight Starvation decreased the copulation rate when food was not available.
@highlight Hunger state and food availability act synergistically on mating behaviour.
