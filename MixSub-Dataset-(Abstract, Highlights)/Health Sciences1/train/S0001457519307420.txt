 Powered two wheelers are growing globally each year as they are considered an attractive alternative to cars especially on congested traffic situations . However PTWs represent an important challenge for road safety . In fact in 2016 Spain ranked fifth in terms of PTW fatalities among EU 28 . For this reason this paper aims to investigate which are the patterns among crash characteristics contributing to PTW crashes in Spain . Data from 78 611 crashes involving PTWs occurred in Spain in the period 20112013 were analyzed . The analysis was performed by using classification trees and rules discovery which are suitable models aimed at extracting knowledge and identifying valid and understandable patterns from large amounts of data previously unknown and indistinguishable . The response variables assessed in this study were severity and crash type . As a result several combinations of road environmental and drivers characteristics associated with severity and typology of PTW crashes in Spain were identified . Based on the analysis results several countermeasures to solve or mitigate the safety issues identified in the study were proposed .

@highlight This study investigated PTW crashes occurred in Spain in the period 20112013.
@highlight The study used different data mining techniques classification trees and rules discovery.
@highlight Crash types associated with high severity are run off the road ROR and head on HO crashes.
@highlight Crash patterns associated with high severity and with ROR and HO crashes have been singled out.
@highlight Countermeasures to mitigate PTW severe injuries and fatalities are suggested.
