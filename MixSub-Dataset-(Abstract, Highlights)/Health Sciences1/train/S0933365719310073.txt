 High resolution medical images are preferred in clinical diagnoses and subsequent analysis . However the acquisition of HR medical images is easily affected by hardware devices . As an effective and trusted alternative method the super resolution technology is introduced to improve the image resolution . Compared with traditional SR methods the deep learning based SR methods can obtain more clear and trusted HR images . In this paper we propose a trusted deep convolutional neural network based SR method named feedback adaptive weighted dense network for HR medical image reconstruction . Specifically the proposed FAWDN can transmit the information of the output image to the low level features by a feedback connection . To explore advanced feature representation and reduce the feature redundancy in dense blocks an adaptive weighted dense block is introduced to adaptively select the informative features . Experimental results demonstrate that our FAWDN outperforms the state of the art image SR methods and can obtain more clear and trusted medical images than comparative methods .
