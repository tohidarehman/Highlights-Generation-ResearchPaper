 The study of aggressive driving is an important step in the reduction of crashes due to this behavior . However even though various measures of aggressive driver behavior have been proposed a more thorough examination of what the driving public perceives as aggressive driving behavior can be performed . A nationally representative sample of 198 American adults saw and rated the aggressiveness of various driving behaviors in videos . The videos were shown from a first second or third person perspective . Some videos depicted close following varying in speed and distance from the car ahead . Participants also saw illegal passing videos and collision or near collision videos . A number of variables that might influence judgments of aggressive driving were included as controls . Following other drivers closely was rated as aggressive especially when viewed from a third person perspective . Illegal passes were viewed as more aggressive than speeding . Faster speeds didnt increase aggressive ratings much regardless of perspective . Aggressiveness ratings were especially high for acts that could be considered road rage . People high in trait anger have a bias to view many driving behaviors as intentionally aggressive .
