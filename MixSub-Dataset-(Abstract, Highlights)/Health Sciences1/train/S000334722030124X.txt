 Interindividual variation in cognitive ability has been widely reported across a diverse array of taxa and has recently been modelled as a broad consequence of a speedaccuracy trade off . This trade off can result in alternative cognitive phenotypes which in turn could be associated with differences in behavioural and life history traits . While a growing body of literature suggests that performance in certain cognitive and behavioural traits do covary multiple traits must be measured at these different levels to understand how differences in cognition determine variation in other traits . We tested for the presence of distinct cognitive phenotypes in the honey bee

@highlight Multiple cognitive traits define a cognitive axis in honey bees.
@highlight There are two distinct cognitive phenotypes among honey bee foragers.
@highlight Slow and fast bees conform to the predictions of a speedaccuracy trade off.
@highlight The two cognitive phenotypes differ in their behaviour and life history traits.
