 Skateboarding is being an emerging travel model especially for young travelers . The conflict between skateboarders and the other road users has raised safety concerns for traffic engineers . Safety evaluation about skateboarder related conflicts has not been well performed due to the low skateboarder related crashes and the limited historical crash data . Near crashes have been considered as surrogate data for skateboard related safety evaluation . This paper developed a procedure to extract skateboarder associated near crashes automatically with the roadside Light Detection and Ranging . A new indicator distance deceleration time profile which combined time space and deceleration information was introduced for skateboarder pedestrian near crash identification . The DDTP was developed for the roadside LiDAR data specially . The case studies showed that the proposed method can extract skateboarder pedestrian safety critical events with high accuracy . The proposed method can be also used for skateboarder vehicle and skateboarder bicycle near crash identification .

@highlight LiDAR was used for skateboarder related conflicts identification.
@highlight A new indicator DDTP was introduced for skateboarder pedestrian near crash identification.
@highlight The developed procedure was evaluated using the real world data.
