 The era of Big Data has arrived . Recently under the environment of intelligent transportation systems and connected automated vehicles Big Data has been applied in various fields in transportation including traffic safety . In this study we review recent research studies that employed Big Data to analyze traffic safety under the environment of ITS and CAV . The particular topics include crash detection or prediction discovery of contributing factors to crashes driving behavior analysis crash hotspot identification etc . From the reviewed studies employing advanced analytics for Big Data has a great potential for understanding and enhancing traffic safety . Big Data application in traffic safety integrates and processes massive multi source data breaks through the limitations of the traditional data analytics and discovers and solves the problems which can not be solved by the traditional safety analytics . Lastly suggestions are provided for future Big Data safety analytics under the environment of ITS and CAV .
