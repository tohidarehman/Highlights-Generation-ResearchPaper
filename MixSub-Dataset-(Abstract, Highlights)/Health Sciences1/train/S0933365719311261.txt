 The increasing access to brain signal data using electroencephalography creates new opportunities to study electrophysiological brain activity and perform ambulatory diagnoses of neurological disorders . This work proposes a pairwise distance learning approach for schizophrenia classification relying on the spectral properties of the signal . To be able to handle clinical trials with a limited number of observations we propose a Siamese neural network architecture to learn a discriminative feature space from pairwise combinations of observations per channel . In this way the multivariate order of the signal is used as a form of data augmentation further supporting the network generalization ability . Convolutional layers with parameters learned under a cosine contrastive loss are proposed to adequately explore spectral images derived from the brain signal . The proposed approach for schizophrenia diagnostic was tested on reference clinical trial data under resting state protocol achieving 0.950.05 accuracy 0.980.02 sensitivity and 0.920.07 specificity . Results show that the features extracted using the proposed neural network are remarkably superior than baselines to diagnose schizophrenia suggesting the existence of non trivial electrophysiological brain patterns able to capture discriminative neuroplasticity profiles among individuals . The code is available on Github
