 Extreme Weather Events are currently not well understood by the maritime community even though the shipping industry is not immune to their potential disastrous consequences . This is critical for the Arctic supply chains considering the serious lack of experience data communication facilities and that rules and regulations governing the region are at the embryonic stage . Understanding such the study develops an effective risk assessment model in the context of the maritime supply chain and quantifies the risks associated with EWEs in the Arctic . The model is developed based on a Bayesian Belief Network that reflects a probabilistic risk priority index based on Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis . Here we introduce a new index based on a weighted combination of the likelihood visibility and consequence of risk factors . The model is quantified by 51 respondents based on their sailing experience with cargo carriers along the Northwest Passage . Our findings suggest that dense fog and ice accretion are distinctly critical risk factors followed by thunderstorm hail and or waterspouts extreme coldness and blizzard . The study offers useful insight to all right and stakeholders in the Arctic . Moreover it presents an effective tool to develop high resolution maps for maritime routes considering important shipping elements .
