 Alcohol involved riders tend to engage in other risk taking behaviours such as un helmeted riding which could further increases injury severity . The combined effect of alcohol involved and un helmeted riding on fatal injuries is rarely investigated . This study investigated the interaction effect between blood alcohol concentration and helmet use on fatal injuries . This study used the National Taiwan Traffic Crash Dataset for the period from 2011 to 2015 . Data on road crashes involving a motorcycle and an automobile were extracted and analysed . Multiple logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio . We calculated an interaction effect for blood alcohol concentration and helmet use based on STROBE guidelines . There were a total of 669 292 motorcyclist casualties among these casualties 3459 motorcyclists sustained fatal injuries . Alcohol involved riders were 9.47 times more likely than sober ones to sustain fatal injuries . Alcohol involved and un helmeted riders were approximately 18 times more likely to sustain fatal injuries than sober and helmeted riders . Riders involved in head on crashes and approach turn motorcycle crashes had an increased probability of sustaining fatal injuries by 240 and 132 respectively . This study found that alcohol involved riding acts synergistically with un helmeted riding to increase motorcyclist injury severity .
