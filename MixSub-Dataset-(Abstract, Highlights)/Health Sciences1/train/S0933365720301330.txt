 The problem of the explainability of AI decision making has attracted considerable attention in recent years . In considering AI diagnostics we suggest that explainability should be explicated as effective contestability . Taking a patient centric approach we argue that patients should be able to contest the diagnoses of AI diagnostic systems and that effective contestation of patient relevant aspect of AI diagnoses requires the availability of different types of information about 1 the AI systems use of data 2 the systems potential biases 3 the system performance and 4 the division of labour between the system and health care professionals . We justify and define thirteen specific informational requirements that follows from contestability . We further show not only that contestability is a weaker requirement than some of the proposed criteria of explainability but also that it does not introduce poorly grounded double standards for AI and health care professionals diagnostics and does not come at the cost of AI system performance . Finally we briefly discuss whether the contestability requirements introduced here are domain specific .

@highlight Many high level reports endorse explainability as a necessary feature of good AI.
@highlight From a patient centric view explainability is best understood as effective contestability.
@highlight Effective contestability of AI diagnostics requires information about data use bias accuracy and the diagnostic role of AI.
