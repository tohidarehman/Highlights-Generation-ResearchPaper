 Dispersal is a fundamental ecological process that on an individual level is associated with intrinsic and fixed personality traits such as boldness . However it is unknown whether personality traits or behavioural syndromes might change as a consequence of dispersal itself . We analysed 14 GPS collared grey wolves

@highlight We tested the hypothesis that wolf boldness increases during dispersal.
@highlight We used avoidance of human habitat elements as a proxy for boldness.
@highlight Wolves strongly avoided human elements before dispersing.
@highlight Wolf avoidance of human elements decreased substantially during dispersal.
@highlight This shift in avoidance persisted after the establishment of a new territory.
