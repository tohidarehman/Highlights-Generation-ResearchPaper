 Assessing local habitat quality via social cues provided by conspecific or heterospecific individuals sharing the same needs is a widespread strategy of social information use for breeding habitat selection . However gathering information about putative competitors may involve agonistic costs . The use of social cues reflecting local habitat quality acquired from a distance such as acoustic cues could therefore be favoured . Bird songs are conspicuous signals commonly assumed to reliably reflect producer quality and thereby local site quality . Birds of various species have been shown to be attracted to breeding sites by conspecific and heterospecific songs and to use conspecific song features as information on producer quality . Whether they can do the same with heterospecific song features and whether this depends on the individual s own phenotype and especially its competitive ability remains unknown . We used a playback experiment in a wild population of collared flycatchers

@highlight Birds may use song features from heterospecifics to assess territory quality.
@highlight We tested whether collared flycatchers use great tit song features for settlement.
@highlight Old aggressive females settled in zones with high quality tit song playback.
@highlight Nonaggressive females settled in zones with low quality tit song playback.
@highlight Our experiment shows complex use of information from heterospecific song features.
