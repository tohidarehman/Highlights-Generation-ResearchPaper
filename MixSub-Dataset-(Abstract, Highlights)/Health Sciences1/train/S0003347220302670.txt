 Vocalizations often contain both dynamic information related to short term fluctuations in the individual s emotional states and static information related to long term attributes such as age sex weight and body size which define an individual vocal signature . While both types of information may be of functional value to receivers dynamic information requires acoustic versatility while static information depends on acoustic stability . Here we investigated whether an individual vocal signature is present across the vocal repertoire of the bonobo

@highlight We investigated the coding of individual signature in a graded vocal repertoire.
@highlight We compared the strength of individual vocal signature across the bonobo repertoire.
