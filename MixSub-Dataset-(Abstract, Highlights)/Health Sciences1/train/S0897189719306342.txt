 Nurses use of evidence based practice improves patient outcomes through provision of optimal patient care . The Evidence Based Practice Mentorship Program is a self directed year long immersion program implemented for staff nurses to experience the EBP process with close mentor support . The aim of this program is to bolster a culture of EBP at a single large pediatric quaternary care hospital in the Northeast . A total of 81 nurses across 4 cohorts participated in this organization wide program from 2016 to 2019 . To date the program has produced 46 internally and externally disseminated EBP projects . Of the graduates 7 nurse mentees have become formal EBPMP mentor s 3 have applied and been accepted into the organizational based Nursing Science Fellowship to carry out clinical inquiry projects to fill important literary gaps and 6 have received promotions or career advancements . Most importantly graduates have anecdotally reported that program participation inspired deeper critical reflection of patient care . Utilizing mentorship to facilitate EBP was a key educational strategy for the busy mentors and mentees as many of the nurse participants were direct care providers . This self directed program resulted in a high project completion rate leading to continued organizational support for the program which is now in its fourth year .
