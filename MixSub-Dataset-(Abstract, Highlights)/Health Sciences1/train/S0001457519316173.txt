 The study analyses the Human Machine Interface of a driver assistance system for cooperative driving such as merging or turning left situations . Three versions of the HMI are varied as independent variables within subjects . Two versions displayed in the instrument cluster focus either on a dynamic or a static illustration of the current status of the system . The third HMI developed in a preliminary study serves as benchmark to compare the cluster based HMIs . The benchmark HMI uses the same status messages and highlights the partner directly in the environment by augmented reality elements . The results of the present study show that the Benchmark best supported cooperative behavior . Both versions of the HMI located in the instrument cluster also support cooperative behavior and are accepted by the drivers . However more glances are shifted from the relevant area in the driving scenario towards the cluster compared to the Benchmark HMI . With the static version the participants felt more distracted compared to the dynamic HMI . In conclusion as long as it is not technically possible to display the partner directly in the environment a dynamic display in cooperation situations is a good alternative .

@highlight A cooperative driving system for manual and automated driving is evaluated.
@highlight The form of information presentation dynamic vs. static is investigated.
@highlight Both versions of the HMI support cooperative behavior and are accepted.
@highlight With the static HMI the participants felt more distracted than the dynamic one.
