 Heart failure is associated with poor quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality . This study aimed to investigate effect of application of Gordon s functional health pattern model in nursing care of symptomatic HF patients on quality of life morbidity and mortality in the post discharge 30 day . This is a prospective randomized controlled study conducted in a single center . Experimental group received nursing care planned in accordance with Gordon s FHP model . 60 control and 60 experimental HF patients were included in the study . In the control group nursing care was given according to the standard protocol of the hospital whereas in the experimental group nursing care was given in accordance with Gordon s FHP model . Patients in both groups were followed up after discharge at 30th day . Mean Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire score improved significantly in the experimental group compared to the control group at 30th day . Seven patients in the experimental group and 17 patients in the control group were readmitted in the post discharge 30 day . Application of Gordon s FHP model in the nursing care of HF patients was associated with significantly improved quality of life and reduced hospital readmission rates at 30th day . This was the only independent predictor of 30 day event free survival .
