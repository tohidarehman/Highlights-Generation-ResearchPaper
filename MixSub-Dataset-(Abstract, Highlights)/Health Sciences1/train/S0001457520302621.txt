 Among the three major safety assessment methods for highly automated driving systems test tracks provide high fidelity and a safe and controllable testing environment . However due to the lack of realistic background traffic scenarios that can be tested in test tracks are usually static and limited . To address this limitation a new safety assessment framework is proposed in this paper which integrates an augmented reality testing platform and a testing scenario library generation method . The AR testing platform generates simulated background traffic in test tracks which interact with subject ADS under test to create a realistic traffic environment . The TSLG method can systematically generate a set of critical scenarios under each operational design domain and the critical scenarios generated from the TSLG method can be imported into the AR testing platform . The proposed framework has been implemented in the Mcity test track at the University of Michigan with a Level 4 ADS . Field test results show that the proposed framework can accurately and efficiently evaluate the safety performance of highly ADS in a cost effective fashion . In the cut in case study the proposed framework is estimated to accelerate the assessment process by

@highlight This paper presents a new safety assessment framework for highly automated driving systems in test tracks.
@highlight The framework integrates an augmented reality testing platform and a testing scenario library generation method together.
@highlight The framework has been implemented in Mcity test facility with a SAE Level 4 ADS vehicle.
@highlight The framework can accelerate the assessment process by multiple orders of magnitude comparing to the on road test approach.
