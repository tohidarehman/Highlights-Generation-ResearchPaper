 Learning a Bayesian network is a difficult and well known task that has been largely investigated . To reduce the number of candidate graphs to test some authors proposed to incorporate a priori expert knowledge . Most of the time this a priori information between variables influences the learning but never contradicts the data . In addition the development of Bayesian networks integrating time such as dynamic Bayesian networks allows identifying causal graphs in the context of longitudinal data . Moreover in the context where the number of strongly correlated variables is large and the number of patients low if a biomarker has a mediated effect on another the learning algorithm would associate them wrongly and vice versa . In this article we propose a method to use the a priori expert knowledge as hard constraints in a structure learning method for Bayesian networks with a time dependant exposure . Based on a simulation study and an application where we compared our method to the state of the art PC algorithm the results showed a better recovery of the true graphs when integrating hard constraints a priori expert knowledge even for small level of information .
