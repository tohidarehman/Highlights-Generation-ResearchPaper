 Cold developmental conditions can greatly affect adult life history of ectotherms in seasonal habitats . Such effects are mostly negative but sometimes adaptive . Here we tested how cold conditions experienced during pupal development affect adult wing melanization of an insect ectotherm the Glanville fritillary butterfly

@highlight Pupal cold exposure induces wing melanization and may alter basking behaviour.
@highlight Preflight heating rate was not increased by darker wings but was via wing vibrating.
@highlight More melanized wings reduced mating success in both sexes and altered space use.
@highlight We found no clear thermal advantage of wing melanization but a fitness cost.
