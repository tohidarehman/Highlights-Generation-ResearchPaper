 The scholarship of euthanasia indicates that in most cases to date non voluntary euthanasia has been studied where euthanasia is legalized . Findings of these studies demonstrate the slippery slope and reveal that non voluntary euthanasia is pervasive in these countries . The research is aimed at answering two questions What are the common death hastening methods Is the acceptance of active non voluntary euthanasia related to the legal status of euthanasia A qualitative study was conducted in ICUs with 15 nurses . All of the interviewees refused to take part in the death hastening cases and did not obey any doctor s instruction that could hasten or cause death . Therefore doctors who conducted NVE did it by themselves . The present study provides evidence of the phenomenon of illegal non voluntary euthanasia as a routine practice by physicians in palliative care units in Israel . Interviews with 15 nurses employed in these units shed light on the means and methods used by these doctors to hasten terminal patients death . We conclude that Nurses in various end of life care units persist in preserving their professional integrity and refuse to obey doctors instructions for non voluntary euthanasia . The slippery slope argument has been refuted in this context .
