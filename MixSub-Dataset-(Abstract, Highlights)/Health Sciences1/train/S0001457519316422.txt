 Providing drivers with real time weather information and driving assistance during adverse weather including fog is crucial for safe driving . The primary focus of this study was to develop an affordable in vehicle fog detection method which will provide accurate trajectory level weather information in real time . The study used the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study video data and utilized several promising Deep Learning techniques including Deep Neural Network Recurrent Neural Network Long Short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Network . Python programming on the TensorFlow Machine Learning library has been used for training the Deep Learning models . The analysis was done on a dataset consisted of three weather conditions including clear distant fog and near fog . During the training process two optimizers including Adam and Gradient Descent have been used . While the overall prediction accuracy of the DNN RNN LSTM and CNN using the Gradient Descent optimizer were found to be around 85 77 84 and 97 respectively much improved overall prediction accuracy of 88 91 93 and 98 for the DNN RNN LSTM and CNN respectively were observed considering the Adam optimizer . The proposed fog detection method requires only a single video camera to detect weather conditions and therefore can be an inexpensive option to be fitted in maintenance vehicles to collect trajectory level weather information in real time for expanding as well as updating weather based Variable Speed Limit systems and Advanced Traveler Information Systems .
