 The recognition of cardiac arrhythmia in minimal time is important to prevent sudden and untimely deaths . The proposed work includes a complete framework for analyzing the Electrocardiogram signal . The three phases of analysis include 1 the ECG signal quality enhancement through noise suppression by a dedicated filter combination 2 the feature extraction by a devoted wavelet design and 3 a proposed hidden Markov model for cardiac arrhythmia classification into Normal Right Bundle Branch Block Left Bundle Branch Block Premature Ventricular Contraction and Atrial Premature Contraction . The main features extracted in the proposed work are minimum maximum mean standard deviation and median . The experiments were conducted on forty five ECG records in MIT BIH arrhythmia database and in MIT BIH noise stress test database . The proposed model has an overall accuracy of 99.7 with a sensitivity of 99.7 and a positive predictive value of 100 . The detection error rate for the proposed model is 0.0004 . This paper also includes a study of the cardiac arrhythmia recognition using an IoMT approach .
