 Social learning can be a shortcut for acquiring locally adaptive information . Animals that live in social groups have better access to social information but gregarious and nonsocial species are also frequently exposed to social cues . Thus social learning might simply reflect an animal s general ability to learn rather than an adaptation to social living . Here we investigated social learning and the effect of frequency of social exposure in nonsocial juvenile Port Jackson sharks

@highlight Nonsocial juvenile Port Jackson sharks learnt faster with trained demonstrators.
@highlight Acquisition occurred between training bouts.
@highlight Social living is not a prerequisite for social learning in elasmobranchs.
