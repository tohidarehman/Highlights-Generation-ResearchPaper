 Epistasis identification is critical for determining susceptibility to human genetic diseases . The rapid development of technology has enabled scalability to make multifactor dimensionality reduction measurements an effective calculation tool that achieves superior detection . However the classification of high risk or low risk groups in multidrug resistance operations calls for extensive research . In this study an improved fuzzy sigmoid method using the membership degree in MDR was proposed for solving the limitations of binary classification . The FS method combined with MDR measurements yielded an improved ability to distinguish similar frequencies of potential multifactor genotypes . We compared our results with other MDR based methods and FSMDR achieved superior detection rates on simulated data sets . The results indicated that the fuzzy classifications can provide insight into the uncertainty of H L classification in MDR operation . FSMDR successfully detected significant epistasis of coronary artery disease in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data set .

@highlight This study proposes an improved MDR using the fuzzy sigmoid method FSMDR to detect epistasis.
@highlight The 46 epistatic models and a large real data set are used to compare FSMDR with other MDR based methods.
@highlight The results demonstrate that FSMDR achieves superior detection rates than other MDR based methods on epistasis detection.
@highlight The fuzzy sigmoid method effectively improves the discrimination of two multifactor genotypes in MDR operation.
@highlight FSMDR does not need to select the optimal adjustment parameters of fuzzy sets in practical data applications.
