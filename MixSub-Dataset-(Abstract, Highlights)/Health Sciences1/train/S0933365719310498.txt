 Knee contact force is an important factor to evaluate the knee joint function for the patients with knee joint impairment . However the KCF measurement based on the instrumented prosthetic implants or inverse dynamics analysis is limited due to the invasive expensive price and time consumption . In this work we propose a KCF prediction method by integrating the Artificial Fish Swarm and the Random Forest algorithm . First we train a Random Forest to learn the nonlinear relation between gait parameters and contact pressures based on a dataset of three patients instrumented with knee replacement . Then we use the improved artificial fish group algorithm to optimize the main parameters of the Random Forest based KCF prediction model . The extensive experiments verify that our method can predict the medial knee contact force both before and after the intervention of gait patterns and the performance outperforms the classical multi body dynamics analysis and artificial neural network model .

@highlight The first is to implement knee contact force prediction via Random Forest. Compared with other algorithms proposed by other papers the algorithm has better performance.
@highlight The study uses the improved Fish Swarm algorithm to optimize the main parameters of the Random Forest model. From the experimental results ours improved method has better performance on the standard test function compared with the other 5 advanced improvement methods.
@highlight The proposed methodology was cost effective and easy to recreate for any subject.
