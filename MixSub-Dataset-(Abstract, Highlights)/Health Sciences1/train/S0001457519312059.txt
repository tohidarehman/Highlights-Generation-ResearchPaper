 Roadway departure crashes contribute to a large proportion of fatal and injury crashes in the United States . These crash types are more likely to occur along horizontal curve sections of a roadway . Countermeasures that prevent vehicles from departing the roadway is one method to mitigate roadway departure crashes . Pennsylvania has deployed on pavement horizontal curve warning markings in advance of horizontal curves on two lane rural highways as a roadway departure crash reduction strategy . This study used an Empirical Bayes before after study design to evaluate the safety effects of the horizontal curve warning pavement markings . A total of 263 treatment sites and more than 21 000 reference sites were included in the evaluation . Crash modification factors were developed for total fatal plus injury run off road nighttime nighttime run off road and nighttime fatal plus injury crashes . The point estimates for each of these crashes ranged from 0.65 to 0.77 the results were statistically significant for total and fatal plus injury crashes at the 95th percentile confidence level .

@highlight Horizontal Curve Warning Pavement Markings in Pennsylvania were Evaluated.
@highlight Empirical Bayes Before After Analysis was Used.
@highlight Multiple crash types and severities along horizontal curves were considered.
@highlight Findings indicate that the pavement markings reduce run off road crashes by 2335 .
