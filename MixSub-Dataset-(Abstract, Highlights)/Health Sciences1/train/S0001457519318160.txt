 Rear end crashes are closely related to car following situation of vehicles . Speeding and insufficient headway are the major reasons as the drivers have not enough time to react to a sudden brake from the leading vehicle . Perceptual countermeasures like speed reduction markings are widely used in practice for accident prevention and are verified with substantial effectiveness . However compared with its practical application the perceptual countermeasures are rarely analyzed in depth from the perspective of drivers visual perception where the meaning of perceptual actually dwells . In addition its effect on drivers headway choice is almost ignored in previous research . Given this the present study explored the effects of a certain type of perceptual treatment i.e . the peripheral transverse line markings on drivers choice of speed and headway in car following by a series of on road experiments . In the on road experiments temporary line markings were installed on a real world freeway in China to shape the PTLMs . The intersection angle

@highlight A series of peripheral transverse line markings PTLMs were installed on a freeway.
@highlight The effects of PTLMs on driving behaviors were analyzed considering visual perception.
@highlight PTLMs could impact drivers speed and headway distance choice.
@highlight General and sectional relative differences of vehicle flow parameters were introduced.
@highlight We provide theoretical support for the perceptual countermeasures on accident prevention.
