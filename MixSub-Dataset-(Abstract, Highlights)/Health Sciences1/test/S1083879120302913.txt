 Induced pluripotent stem cells have opened up unprecedented opportunities for novel therapeutic options for precision medicine . Hematopoietic stem cell donor pools with previously determined HLA types may be ideal sources for iPSC production . Based on the HLA distribution of cryopreserved cord blood units and registered bone marrow donors we estimated how much of the Korean population could be covered by HLA homozygous iPSCs . We analyzed a total of 143 866 Korean HSC donors . Each donor sample was typed for the HLA A B and DRB1 alleles at low to intermediate resolution by DNA based molecular techniques PCR sequence specific oligonucleotide PCR with sequence specific primers and PCR with sequence based typing . We also identified individuals possessing homozygous HLA haplotypes by direct counting . The matching probabilities for zero mismatch transplantation were calculated for 143 866 Koreans and 50 million potential Korean patients . Among the HSC donor pool 17 HLA A alleles 41 HLA B alleles and 13 HLA DRB1 alleles as well as 128 homozygous HLA A B DRB1 haplotypes were identified at serologic equivalents and those haplotypes cumulatively matched 93.20 of the 143 866 Korean donors as zero HLA mismatch iPSC sources . Among the combinations of 2 056 haplotypes with frequencies 0.001 in a population of 50 million those 128 homozygous haplotypes can provide 93.65 coverage for potential Korean recipients . Haplobanking of a reasonable number of HLA A B and DRB1 homozygous iPSC lines derived from CBUs and cells of registered BM donors may be an efficient option for allogenic iPSC therapy .

@highlight HLA homozygous induced pluripotent stem cell iPSC lines may be an efficient option for the allogenic iPSC model.
@highlight Previously HLA typed hematopoietic stem cell donors can be ideal sources for iPSC haplobanking.
@highlight 128 homozygous haplotypes among 143 866 Korean donors from the cord blood inventory and bone marrow donor registry can cover 94 of potential Korean recipients.
