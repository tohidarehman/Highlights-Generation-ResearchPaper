 Cytomegalovirus reactivation remains one of the main infectious complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . In this study we explored the role of anti CMV antibody titers in HSCT from alternative donors and to compare the risk of CMV reactivation between posttransplant cyclophosphamide based haploidentical HSCT and antithymocyte globulin based unrelated donor HSCT . We included 98 CMV positive patients 30 undergoing haploidentical HSCT and 68 undergoing URD HSCT . The majority of patients had a malignant disease received a myeloablative conditioning regimen and received a bone marrow graft . The median pretransplantation anti CMV IgG level was 109 U mL . With median follow up of 2.2 years a total of 72 CMV reactivations occurred in 50 patients . There was no difference in CMV reactivation pattern between haploidentical HSCT recipients and URD HSCT recipients . In multivariable analysis until the first event the incidence of CMV reactivation was higher in patients with anti CMV IgG levels 100 U mL 2.38

@highlight Pretransplantation cytomegalovirus CMV IgG titers predict the risk of CMV reactivation in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients.
@highlight An infused CD34 cell dose 1.610E6 cells kg reduces the risk of CMV reactivation.
@highlight CMV reactivation risk is not different between recipients of unrelated donor transplants and recipients of haploidentical transplants.
@highlight The use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens is associated with increased risk of CMV reactivation.
