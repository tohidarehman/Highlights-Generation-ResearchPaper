 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is performed as a curative treatment for children with nonmalignant diseases such as bone marrow failure syndromes and primary immunodeficiencies . Because graft versus host disease is a major factor affecting survival probability and quality of life after HSCT the availability of HLA matched donors restricts the application of HSCT . Recently HSCT with post transplantation cyclophosphamide has emerged as a potent method to prevent GVHD after HSCT from HLA haploidentical donors and some studies have suggested the safety of PTCy HSCT for nonmalignant diseases . We conducted a prospective clinical trial aiming to help confirm the safety of HSCT and further reduction of GVHD using a combination of PTCy and low dose antithymocyte globulin from HLA mismatched related donors for children with nonmalignant diseases . Six patients underwent HSCT and achieved engraftment at a median of 14.5 days and no patient developed severe acute GVHD . All patients had sustained donor chimerism without developing chronic GVHD at the last follow up . In conclusion HSCT with PTCy and low dose ATG from an HLA mismatched related donor were feasible to control GVHD for nonmalignant diseases in the children involved in our study .

@highlight We conducted a prospective trial of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for nonmalignant diseases.
@highlight Post transplantation cyclophosphamide and low dose antithymocyte globulin were used as graft versus host disease GVHD prophylaxis.
@highlight All 6 patients achieved engraftment and none developed severe GVHD.
@highlight All patients had sustained full donor chimerism without chronic GVHD.
