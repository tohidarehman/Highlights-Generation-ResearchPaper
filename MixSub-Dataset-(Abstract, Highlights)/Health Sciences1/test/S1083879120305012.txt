 The intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in the development of host innate immune cells such as monocytes dendritic cells and natural killer cells . We examined the association between intestinal microbiota and subsequent immune reconstitution of circulating monocyte DC and NK cell subsets in 38 adult patients undergoing single unit cord blood transplantation . A higher diversity of intestinal microbiota at 1 month was significantly associated with higher counts of plasmacytoid DCs at 7 months after CBT as measured by the Chao1 index . Principal coordinate analysis of unweighted UniFrac distances showed significant differences between higher and lower classical monocyte reconstitution at 7 months post CBT . The families
