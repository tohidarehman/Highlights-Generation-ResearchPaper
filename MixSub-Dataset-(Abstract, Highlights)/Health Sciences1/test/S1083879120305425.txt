 The combination of hypomethylating agents with the selective Bcl 2 inhibitor venetoclax has emerged as a highly active regimen in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in both the upfront and relapsed refractory settings . We report our early experience with a cohort of patients who were able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation after HMA VEN therapy . Thirty two patients with AML with a median age of 62 years underwent alloHCT after HMA VEN therapy . Twenty two were in complete remission CR with incomplete count recovery at time of HCT . With a median follow up of 14.4 months the 1 year overall survival was 62.5 and disease free survival was 43.8 . The 1 year nonrelapse mortality rate was 18.8 and the cumulative incidence of relapse was 37.5 . Among patients who underwent alloHCT in CR the 1 year OS was 77.3 and the cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 9.1 . The cumulative incidence of grade II IV acute graft versus host disease was 43.8 . We conclude that alloHCT after HMA VEN is therapy associated with favorable allogeneic HCT outcomes in newly diagnosed older patients with AML as well as those with r r AML .

@highlight The combination of hypomethylating agents with the selective Bcl 2 inhibitor venetoclax VEN HMA as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation alloHCT is associated with favorable HCT outcomes.
@highlight VEN HMA could allow more patients of older age to proceed to potentially curative alloHCT.
@highlight AlloHCT outcomes are particularly good in patients who undergo HCT in complete remission after VEN HMA therapy.
