 The emotional and physical toll on caregivers of cancer patients is well documented but research evaluating the financial burdens and time commitments of caregivers is limited . We suspected that the rural location of our cancer center would intensify these burdens for caregivers . We conducted a prospective trial to assess the out of pocket expenses and time commitment of caregivers of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients within the first 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital from a National Cancer Institute designated comprehensive cancer center . These results show that caregivers of autologous recipients paid out of pocket expenses of 196 over 4 weeks . If lost wages were included the expenses increased to 736 during this period . Caregivers of allogeneic recipients had out of pocket expenses of 110 in 4 weeks or a total of 610 when lost wages were included . In the month after discharge from the hospital caregivers traveled a median distance of 450 miles or 560 miles depending on whether the patient received an autologous transplant or an allogeneic transplant respectively . These results demonstrate a compelling need to address caregiver support given the significant financial out of pocket expenses and time commitment .
