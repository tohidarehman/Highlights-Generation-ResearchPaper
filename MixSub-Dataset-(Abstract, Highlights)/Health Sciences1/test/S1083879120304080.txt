 Refractory early relapsed and 17p deletion p53 mutation TP53mut positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been conventionally considered a high risk disease potentially eligible for treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation . In this multicenter retrospective analysis of 157 patients we compared the outcomes of patients with high risk CLL treated with alloSCT a B cell receptor pathway inhibitor and both . Seventy one patients were treated with BCRis 67 patients underwent reduced intensity conditioning alloSCT and 19 received alloSCT with a BCRi before and or after transplantation . Inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses were performed to compare the alloSCT and no alloSCT groups in the 2 groups 5 year OS PFS and cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality and relapse were 40 versus 60

@highlight The incidence of relapse at 5 years post transplantation was 38 in the allogeneic stem cell transplantation alloSCT group and 83 in the no alloSCT group 
@highlight  .005 .
@highlight The overall survival OS of patients treated with B cell receptor pathway inhibitors plus alloSCT was 83 at 3 years and 74 at 5 years.
@highlight After 2012 OS improved for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergoing alloSCT.
