 Plasma cell leukemia is a rare and very aggressive plasma cell disorder . The optimal treatment approach including whether to pursue an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation is not clear given the lack of clinical trial based evidence . This single center retrospective study describes the outcomes of 16 patients with PCL who underwent either autoSCT or alloSCT for PCL in the era of novel agents between 2007 and 2019 . The median age of the cohort was 58 years . High risk cytogenetics were found in 50 of the patients . All patients received a proteasome inhibitor and or immunomodulatory drug based regimen before transplantation . At the time of transplantation 10 patients obtained at least a very good partial response . The response after autoSCT was at least a VGPR in 6 patients in 5 . All patients undergoing alloSCT achieved a CR at 3 months . Maintenance therapy was provided to 5 patients after autoSCT . The median progression free survival after transplantation was 6 months in the autoSCT group compared with 18 months in the alloSCT group

@highlight Allogeneic stem cell transplantation SCT did not offer a significant survival advantage over autologous SCT.
@highlight Relapse with progressive disease was the main cause of death.
@highlight Patients with PCL should be included in clinical trials of novel immunotherapies.
