 Patients with severe aplastic anemia who fail immunosuppressive therapy have a dismal prognosis . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor is one of the most effective treatment options . Two institutions have independently adopted a post transplantation cyclophosphamide approach for patients with SAA undergoing HSCT from a URD . Thirteen patients were included 11 of whom had been treated with immunosuppressive therapy . Eight patients had a mismatched URD . All patients were conditioned with fludarabine cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation in various dosage combinations . PTCy was given at a dose of 100 mg kg . Two patients died and overall survival was 85 at 2 years . All patients engrafted but 1 patient developed secondary graft failure . Of the 11 patients alive after 2 years 9 had complete donor chimerism . All surviving patients were transfusion independent . Ten patients had cytomegalovirus reactivation and 2 patients had more than 1 reactivation . No Epstein Barr virus reactivation or post transplantation lymphoproliferative disease was observed . Four patients had mild hemorrhagic cystitis . In summary our findings show that PTCy is a promising treatment for patients with SAA undergoing URD HSCT .

@highlight Post transplantation cyclophosphamide PTCy is feasible for patients with severe aplastic anemia SAA undergoing unrelated donor URD hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT .
@highlight The toxicity of PTCy was low in patients with SAA undergoing URD HSCT.
@highlight The engraftment rate of URD HSCT for SAA is promising.
@highlight High total nucleated cell number was associated with faster engraftment.
