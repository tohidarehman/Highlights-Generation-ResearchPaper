 In the setting of T cell depleted full haplotype mismatched transplantation adoptive immunotherapy with regulatory T cells and conventional T cells can prevent graft versus host disease and improve post transplantation immunologic reconstitution and is associated with a powerful graft versus leukemia effect . To improve the purity and the quantity of the infused Tregs good manufacturing practices compatible expansion protocols are needed . Here we expanded Tregs using an automated clinical grade protocol . Cells were extensively characterized in vitro and their efficiency was tested in vivo in a mouse model . Tregs were selected by CliniMacs CD4

@highlight Good manufacturing practice GMP automated expanded T regulatory cells Tregs are in vitro and in vivo characterized.
@highlight Tregs produce high amounts of IL 10 granzyme B and IL 35.
@highlight Expanded Tregs protect mice from graft versus host disease.
@highlight TIM3 cells emerge as a potentially highly suppressive population.
