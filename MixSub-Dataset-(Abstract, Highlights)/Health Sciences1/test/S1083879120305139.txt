 Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is one of the most common neurologic complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . We aimed to evaluate the incidence clinical and imaging features of PRES in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia following HSCT . This prospective study included all post HSCT patients with underlying FA disease between 2014 and 2017 . Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in all individuals who developed neurologic symptoms . PRES was diagnosed based on clinic radiological evidence . Follow up MRI was performed in all patients with PRES within two months . Forty one patients with FA were enrolled . Out of 15 patients with acute neurologic symptoms PRES was diagnosed in 9 individuals . The occurrence of PRES was significantly higher in patients who had a donor with a 1 locus mismatch

@highlight Individuals with Fanconi anemia have a higher incidence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome PRES .
@highlight Cyclosporine level is not correlated with PRES occurrence.
@highlight PRES can present with a nonposterior distribution.
@highlight PRES is nonreversible in all cases.
