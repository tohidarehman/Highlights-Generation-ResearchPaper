 Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy is approved in the United States for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia and aggressive B cell lymphomas . Multiple cardiovascular adverse events associated with CAR Ts have been observed in small studies but no large scale studies exist . Leveraging the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System we identified all reported adverse events associated with CAR T therapy from 2017 to 2019 . Reports with missing age and sex were excluded . CVEs were classified into arrhythmias heart failure myocardial infarction and other CVEs . Logistic regression and hierarchical clustering were used to identify factors associated with CVEs . A total of 996 reported AEs were observed . Of all patients experiencing AEs the median age was 54 years 38.9 were females . In total 19.7 of all AEs reported to the FDA were CVEs . The most common CVEs were arrhythmia followed by HF and MI . In adjusted analysis a positive association was observed between those presenting with CVE with neurotoxicity odds ratio 1.76 95 confidence interval 1.20 to 2.60

@highlight FDA Adverse Events Reporting System data show 20 of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy adverse events were cardiovascular adverse events CVEs .
@highlight CVEs had all cause mortality of 30 .
@highlight Arrhythmias were the most frequent CVEs.
@highlight Neurotoxicity immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome clustered with CVEs and cytokine release syndrome
