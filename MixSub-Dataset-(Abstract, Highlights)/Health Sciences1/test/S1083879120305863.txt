 Hematopoietic cell transplantation generates new individuals transplant chimeras composed of 2 genetic partnersthe patient and donor derived cellsno longer restricted by their original genomes . Interactions of donor derived and recipient cells occur prominently at the boundary of the recipient with a third partner the microbiome in particular skin and intestinal tract leading to disruption of microbiome homeostasis . These interactions of donor and patient cells at the boundary set the stage for the development of graft versus host disease an expression of the defense of individuality by recipient and donor . Establishment of tolerance and return of homeostasis at the boundary will allow for the survival of the new integrated physiologic individual .
