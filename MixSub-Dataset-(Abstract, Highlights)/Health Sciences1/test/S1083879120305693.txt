 Effective immunosuppressive regimens to prevent the development of graft versus host disease are essential to the success of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . After revolutionizing haploidentical transplantation post transplantation cyclophosphamide is now being evaluated for HCT performed from related and unrelated donors . In this setting 2 recent randomized studies have demonstrated lower rates of GVHD and superior GVHD free relapse free survival with PTCy compared with conventional GVHD prophylaxis . The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network is currently conducting a large randomized phase III multicenter trial comparing PTCy tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil to tacrolimus methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis regimens in reduced intensity allogeneic HCT . Here we review the ongoing study highlight its importance to the field and explore the possible implications of its results on clinical practice .
