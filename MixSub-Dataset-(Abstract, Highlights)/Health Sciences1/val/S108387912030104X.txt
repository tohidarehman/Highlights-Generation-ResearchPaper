 It has been suggested that bridging therapy with intensive chemotherapy and or hypomethylating agents followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be valuable in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes . However the influence of this approach on HSCT outcomes remains poorly defined . Therefore our objective was to investigate the influence of treatment before HSCT in patients with MDS . We retrospectively analyzed data from the Latin American registry of 258 patients from 17 Latin American centers who underwent HSCT from 1988 to 2019 . Our data showed that there was pre HSCT . We detected no significant difference regarding the impact on overall survival of treated and untreated patients before HSCT . Despite these data the type of previous treatment among treated patients showed a significant difference in overall survival . Treatment with hypomethylating agents together with pre HSCT chemotherapy seems to result in better survival of the studied population . These data correspond to the first results obtained through cooperative work between various centers in Latin America comparing the different approaches to patients and reflecting their reality and challenges . Therefore the selection of pretransplant bridge therapy should be analyzed and focus given primarily to those approaches that result in better survival of patients with MDS .

@highlight In pre hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT treated and untreated patients there is no difference in survival.
@highlight The type of pre HSCT treatment has a significant difference in overall survival.
@highlight Hypomethylating agents and chemotherapy in pre HSCT treatment improve myelodysplastic syndrome survival.
