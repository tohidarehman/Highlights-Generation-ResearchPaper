 The significance of clonal evolution in myelofibrosis relapse remains poorly understood . Here we performed panel sequencing in paired samples of 30 patients with MF who relapsed after undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . We identified a median of 2 mutations in a median of 2 genes before allo SCT along with a median of 2 mutations in 2 genes at relapse . Additional whole genome sequencing did not elucidate additional molecular changes . Taken together our data provide further evidence here on MF that clonal evolution after alloSCT is limited and that instead alloSCT selects specific clones .

@highlight Limited clonal evolution of myelofibrosis occurs after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
@highlight Clones are controlled.
@highlight Driver mutations are unaltered.
