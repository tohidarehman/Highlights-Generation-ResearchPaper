 Telehealth involves the use of telecommunication and information technology for the delivery of clinical care and may be a mechanism to alleviate the burden of visits faced by patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation . Few studies have evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth visits in the care of HCT patients . We conducted 27 telehealth visits with 25 patients undergoing HCT using a videoconferencing system that allows for real time 2 way interactions and administered satisfaction surveys to patients and providers . Of the 25 patients included in the study 20 and 5 were undergoing autologous and allogeneic HCT respectively . The telehealth visits were distributed as follows 3 inpatient visits upon admission for HCT 11 inpatient visits between 2 and 14 days post HCT 4 inpatient visits prior to discharge after HCT 8 outpatient post HCT follow up visits and 1 handoff to a community oncologist . Out of a total of 54 provider assessments 7 providers were unable to complete some part of the physical examination but no provider reported being unable to manage patients symptoms through telehealth . Eighty one percent of patients were either satisfied or very satisfied with the telemedicine session . Overall satisfaction was higher among patients than providers . Technological barriers resulting in delays and suboptimal physical examination were largely responsible for provider dissatisfaction . The use of telehealth to deliver comprehensive follow up care to HCT patients is feasible across different HCT types but is dependent upon quality of data streaming and videoconferencing technologies .
