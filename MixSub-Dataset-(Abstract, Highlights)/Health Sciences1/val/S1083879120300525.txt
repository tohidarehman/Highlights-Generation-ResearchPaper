 Intestinal flora plays an essential role in regulating immune responses . Changes in the gut flora are associated with poor prognosis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . We aimed to investigate the impact of diverse intestinal flora on survival after allogeneic HSCT . Using next generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene we found that the intestinal microbiota of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT differed significantly from that of healthy controls . Furthermore dysbiosis persisted for at least 1 year after transplantation . Interestingly increased abundance of the genus
