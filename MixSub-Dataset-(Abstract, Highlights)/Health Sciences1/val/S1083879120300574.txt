 Nonmalignant blood diseases such as bone marrow failure disorders immune dysregulation disorders and hemoglobinopathies often lead to shortened life spans and poor quality of life . Many of these diseases can be cured with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation but patients are often not offered the procedure because of perceived insufficient efficacy and or excess toxicity . In 2018 the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network convened a task force to identify the most urgently needed yet feasible clinical trials with potential to improve the outcomes for patients with nonmalignant diseases . This report summarizes the task force discussions and specifies the network plans for clinical trial development for nonmalignant blood diseases .

@highlight Nonmalignant blood diseases are curable by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation BMT .
@highlight Too few patients are offered BMT due to perceived risks.
@highlight The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network has prioritized diseases for clinical trial development.
@highlight Bone marrow failure is the top priority followed by thalassemia.
