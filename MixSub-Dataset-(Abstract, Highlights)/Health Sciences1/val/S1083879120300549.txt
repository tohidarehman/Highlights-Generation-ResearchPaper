 Treatment options are limited for patients with hematologic malignancies who relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation . We conducted a pilot study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of low dose nivolumab a PD 1 inhibitor as maintenance therapy after allo SCT . Of the 4 patients enrolled in the study all rapidly developed immune related adverse events 2 patients experienced serious adverse events including grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 autoimmune encephalopathy . As a result of these unexpected severe toxicities the study was closed to further enrollment . Even at low doses nivolumab maintenance in the post allo SCT setting can cause serious irAEs beyond graft versus host disease and further studies of dosage and timing after allo SCT are needed .

@highlight Even at low doses nivolumab maintenance after allogeneic stem cell transplantation allo SCT can cause serious immune related toxicities.
@highlight We report rapid unexpected occurrences of grade 3 4 immune related adverse events.
@highlight Nivolumab enhanced the graft versus tumor response but more studies are needed to improve tolerability.
