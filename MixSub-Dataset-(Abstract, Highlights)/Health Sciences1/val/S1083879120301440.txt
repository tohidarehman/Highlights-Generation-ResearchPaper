 Primary myelofibrosis and secondary MF developing after polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia are clonal disorders of hematopoiesis . Currently the sole therapy offering the potential of cure is hematopoietic cell transplantation . Several risk classification systems including clinical hematologic and mutational parameters have been proposed . We analyzed the mutational landscape in addition to the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System plus in 55 patients with MF to determine the combined impact on post HCT outcome . Mutations analyzed in 75 genes were most common in

@highlight Mutation load improved the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System DIPSS plus classification in patients with myelofibrosis MF undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.
@highlight Patients with MF with 3 mutations in addition to
@highlight or
@highlight had elevated rates of post transplantation relapse and nonrelapse mortality.
@highlight This was especially true in the highest DIPSS plus risk group.
