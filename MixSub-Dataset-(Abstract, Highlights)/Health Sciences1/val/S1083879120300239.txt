 Graft versus host disease is a common complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation that carries a high mortality . Although calcineurin inhibitors have been widely used in GVHD prophylaxis the incidence of acute GVHD remains at roughly 30 to 50 . Moreover some allo SCT recipients can not tolerate CNI . Thus improved GVHD prevention methods are needed . Our study aimed to determine the prophylactic value of ruxolitinib for GVHD in CNI intolerant patients after allo SCT . Between September 2017 and March 2019 10 patients with hematopoietic malignancies after allo SCT who were intolerant to CNI at our center were enrolled in this study . The regimens were based on a myeloablative busulfan and cyclophosphamide regimen . Antithymocyte globulin was administered to patients with an HLA haploidentical related donor at a dosage of 6 mg kg . All received ruxolitinib to replace CNI as GVHD prophylaxis . Ruxolitinib was initiated at 5 to 10 mg twice daily until 2 to 3 months post transplantation and then tapered gradually and in the absence of GVHD discontinued by day 180 . Eight patients had acute leukemia 1 patient had myeloproliferative neoplasm and 1 patient had natural killer T cell lymphoma . The donor type was a matched sibling donor in 3 patients and an HLA haploidentical related donor in 7 patients . All patients received CNI plus short course of methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis but showed intolerance to CNI within 45 days post transplantation . After ruxolitinib replacement only 1 patient developed grade II skin aGVHD within 100 days and only 1 patient developed severe aGVHD after 100 days . Two patients developed moderate severe chronic GVHD after tapering or stopping ruxolitinib resulting in a 1 year cumulative incidence of moderate severe cGVHD of 21.4 . Cytomegalovirus reactivation occurred in 4 patients and Epstein Barr virus reactivation occurred in 3 patients . None of the patients developed CMV disease or EBV post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder . After a median follow up of 11 months 2 patients relapsed and 7 were alive of whom 6 were negative for minimal residual disease and 4 were off immunosuppressant therapy . The prophylactic application of ruxolitinib for CNI intolerant patients after allo SCT appears to be safe and effective in preventing GVHD but this awaits further study in larger cohorts .

@highlight This observational study showed that calcineurin inhibitor replacement by ruxolitinib as graft versus host disease GVHD prophylaxis appears to be effective in preventing acute and chronic GVHD in those calcineurin inhibitor intolerant patients.
@highlight Ruxolitinib is tolerable as prophylactic regimen with a low rate of severe bacterial infection.
