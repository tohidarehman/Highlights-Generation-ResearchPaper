 High dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation is the standard of care in the treatment of multiple myeloma . Resistance to MEL has been linked to increased DNA repair . Here we sought to identify whether inhibition of poly polymerase synergizes with MEL and can overcome resistance . We tested the synergistic cytotoxicity of 3 inhibitors of PARP veliparib olaparib and niraparib combined with MEL in RPMI8226 and U266 MM cell lines as well as in their MEL resistance counterparts RPMI8226 LR5 and U266 LR6 . The addition of VEL OLA and NIRA to MEL reduced the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC

@highlight Poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 PARP1 inhibition in myeloma cells results in synergistic cytotoxicity with melphalan in vitro and in vivo.
@highlight PARP1 inhibition cannot completely overcome resistance to melphalan which appears to be due to up regulated homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining.
@highlight Expression of
@highlight  and
