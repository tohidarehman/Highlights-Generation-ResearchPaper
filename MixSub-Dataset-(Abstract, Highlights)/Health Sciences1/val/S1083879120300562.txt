 Human herpesvirus 6 encephalitis has a high mortality rate . Among those who survive 80 develop some type of permanent neurologic disorder . Early diagnosis and treatment may help prevent long term sequelae . There have been several case reports as well as retrospective and prospective studies associating HHV 6 encephalitis with some form of sodium imbalance either hyponatremia or hypernatremia however the exact frequency post HCT is unknown with reports ranging from 30 to 100 . We performed a systematic review of the literature and found 34 cases of HHV 6 encephalitis reported in conjunction with sodium imbalance that documented the timing of that imbalance relative to the onset of encephalitis . Sodium imbalance occurred before or at the onset of HHV 6 encephalitis in all but 2 cases . This finding supports previous suggestions that sodium imbalance can be considered an early indicator of the potential development or presence of HHV 6 encephalitis in at risk patient populations .

@highlight An abnormal sodium level before or at the onset of human herpesvirus 6 HHV 6 encephalitis is seen in 94 of cases.
@highlight Hyponatremia accounts for 85 of cases of sodium imbalance with HHV 6 encephalitis.
@highlight Hyponatremia may be an early indicator of HHV 6 encephalitis especially after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
