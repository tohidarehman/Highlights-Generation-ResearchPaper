 In a systematic review and meta analysis we compared allogeneic transplant outcomes after myeloablative conditioning versus reduced intensity conditioning in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes . Only 2 published randomized clinical trials were found with a pooled sample size of 183 . Both studies suggested an overall survival advantage after RIC with a pooled hazard ratio of .67 .41 to 1.09 for RIC versus MAC . Relapse results were also concordant with a pooled HR of 1.55 for RIC versus MAC . Neither result was statistically significant . Comparisons for other outcomes were unremarkable . In conclusion the evidence for the optimal conditioning intensity in myelodysplastic syndromes is weak . Post transplant maintenance strategies and incorporation of genomic information into decision making may improve post transplant outcomes .

@highlight The evidence for MAC versus RIC in allografted patients with MDS is poor.
@highlight We found no significant differences between RIC and MAC in pooled analysis.
