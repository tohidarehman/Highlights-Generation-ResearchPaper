 Electrochemical systems have emerged as an advantageous approach for decentralized management of source separated urine with the possibility of recovering or removing nutrients and generating energy . In this study the kinetics and byproduct selectivity of the electrolytic removal of urea were investigated using a boron doped diamond working electrode under varied operational conditions with a primary focus on comparing undivided and divided reactors . The urea removal rate in the undivided and divided reactors was similar but the divided reactor had an increased required cell voltage needed to maintain the equivalent current density . The current efficiency was similar for 0.1 0.25 and 0.5 A 33.3 83.3 167mA cm

@highlight Urea removal rates were similar in undivided and divided reactors.
@highlight Total ammonia nitrogen was the main urea removal byproduct in the undivided reactor.
@highlight Nitrate was the main urea removal byproduct in the divided reactor.
@highlight The presence of Cl
@highlight increased urea oxidation kinetics and shifted the byproduct to presumably chloramines and dinitrogen.
