 The transverse behavior of a long span three plate precast roof element is investigated by means of an experimental and numerical research . The performed study highlights that the failure mode of this folded plate element is strongly influenced by the amount of transverse reinforcement in the wings . This latter is usually designed through simplified methods which often lead to over dimensioning in terms of steel welded mesh . To avoid excessive costs for the producers transverse reinforcement optimization should be required . In this work a non linear FE modelling was applied for this purpose . The reliability of the followed numerical procedure was first verified by an initial type testing . The agreement between numerical and experimental results showed the efficiency of the model in simulating all the main sources of non linearity related to both material behavior and element geometry . Numerical analyses were so used to perform a parametric study as a function of transverse reinforcement amount aimed at determining a coefficient of model inaccuracy . This coefficient should be used as a correction factor for the element design in routine calculations based on beam theory .
