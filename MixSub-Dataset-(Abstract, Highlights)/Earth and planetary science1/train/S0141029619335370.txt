 Corrosion of steel bars compromises the safety and service life of reinforced concrete structures . This study develops an in situ corrosion monitoring method for reinforced concrete with a distributed fiber optic sensor through experimentation . Reinforced concrete beams instrumented with distributed fiber optic sensors were prepared . A constant current was impressed to the beams immersed in a NaCl solution for accelerated corrosion . The distributed fiber optic sensor was deployed in a helix pattern on the steel bar to measure expansive strains generated by corrosion of the steel bar . The corrosion process of the steel bar was assessed in an electrochemical test . The strain measured from the sensor was utilized to evaluate the volume of the corrosion products surrounding the steel bars and predict the cracking of the concrete cover . To investigate the deterioration process of reinforced concrete different levels of concrete cover thickness and water to cement ratio were studied . The relationship between the mass loss of steel bars and the volume of corrosion products is established to provide a method for evaluating the effects of steel corrosion on the deterioration of reinforced concrete .
