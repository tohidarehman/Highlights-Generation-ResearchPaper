 Unmanned aerial vehicle borne hyperspectral systems can acquire hyperspectral imagery with a high spatial resolution which we refer to here as H

@highlight AV borne datasets with high spectral and spatial resolution H
@highlight  is acquired.
@highlight A deep convolutional neural network with CRF classifier CNNCRF is proposed.
@highlight UAV H
@highlight datasets is classified by CNNCRF for precise crop identification.
@highlight Wuhan UAV borne hyperspectral image WHU Hi has been built as the benchmark.
@highlight Effective results were achieved from the accuracy and visualization performance.
