 This study develops a novel unwelded unbolted ultrahigh performance fibre reinforced concrete grouted connection for prefabricated square tubular composite columns . Herein eight full scale columns with UHPFRC grouted connections are tested to investigate their ultimate tensile and compressive resistance . The test results show that the novel connections exhibit good tensile and compressive resistance and structural stiffness . The primary failure modes are punching shear of the end plate welding fracture at the inner tube tube yielding and local buckling of the steel tube . The test specimens are simulated using finite element analysis in ABAQUS . The experimental and simulated results are in good agreement indicating that the FE simulations can capture the observed failure modes and ultimate tensile and compressive resistance . Thereafter existing analytical design formulas are evaluated to assess their suitability to predict the compressive and tensile resistance of prefabricated tubes with without the novel grouted connections . A good agreement between the formula predictions and the test results are observed . These analytical formulas have the potential to be used in the design of the novel unwelded unbolted UHPFRC grouted connections for prefabricated steel reinforced concrete and steelconcrete composite columns .
