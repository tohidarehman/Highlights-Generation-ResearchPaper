 Both governments and enterprises are giving increasing attention to creating efficient policies for coal de capacity allocation across Chinese regions . In contrast to existing studies we consider both efficiency and equity in the allocation of coal capacity reduction for streamlining the implementation of coal de capacity reform . First the coal production capacity and overcapacity in the coal production regions was estimated using the boundary production function model . Then we constructed a multiple objective programming model based on the Gini coefficient and Data Envelopment Analysis and applied it to coal de capacity allocation . The main results are as follows The coal production capacity in China exceeded 5.7 billion tons by the end of 2015 and coal overcapacity is prevalent across the country . The optimal allocation plan based on the Gi DEA model achieve efficiency across the regions and the Gini coefficient is 0.231 indicating this allocation scheme is efficient and fair . Specifically the large coal production regions should undertake the majority of coal de capacity such as Shanxi Shandong and Guizhou while the small and old coal production regions might undertake a heavier capacity reduction burden such as Fujian Guangxi and Jiangxi . The multiple objective programming model Gi DEA using common weights achieved overall efficiency of the DMUs and generated a unique allocation plan .

@highlight We considered both efficiency and equity principles in coal de capacity allocation.
@highlight An index system was used for evaluating the backward coal capacity and zombie enterprises in each region.
@highlight A multiple objective programming model based on Gini coefficient and DEA was proposed.
@highlight The large coal production regions should undertake the majority of coal de capacity while the small and old ones undertake a heavier reduction burden.
