 Eutrophication and increasing prevalence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms among global inland water bodies is becoming a major concern and requires direct attention . The European Space Agency recently launched the Ocean and Land Color Instrument aboard the Sentinel 3 satellite . The success of the mission will depend on extensive validation efforts for the development of accurate and robust in water algorithms . In this study four full atmospheric correction methods are assessed over four inland water reservoirs in South Africa along with a suite of red NIR based semi analytic and band difference models for chl a estimation which were applied to both full and partial atmospherically corrected data . In addition we tested a novel duplicate pixel correction method to account for duplicate pixels induced by high observation zenith angles . Radiometric errors associated with OLCI Top of Atmosphere radiances over small water targets were also investigated by modeling in situ reflectance measurements to at sensor radiances using MODTRAN . Of the four atmospheric corrections the 6SV1 radiative transfer code showed the most promise for producing reasonable reflectances when compared to in situ measurements . Empirically derived band difference models outperformed all other chl a retrieval methods on both partially and fully corrected reflectances . The Maximum Peak Height algorithm applied to Bottom of Rayleigh Reflectance performed best overall R
