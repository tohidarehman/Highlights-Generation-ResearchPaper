 Structures accumulate damage during their lifespan . Such damage is usually ignored during the assessment of implicit capacity and demand factors of structures . Thus a simplified method for the assessment of structural reliability considering structural degradation is presented . New mathematical expressions for evolutionary structural capacity and structural demand factors are obtained . An example that takes into account degradation due to fatigue in the tower of a wind turbine subject to wind forces is given . Results show that for a wind turbine tower located in La Ventosa Mexico the capacity factor is lower than values recommended by some international building codes .
