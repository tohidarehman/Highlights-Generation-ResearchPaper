 There is a debate on whether the Trojan horse principle is occurring for nanoscale plastic debris . It is realized that NPD have a high capacity to sorb environmental contaminants such as metals from the surrounding environment compared to their microplastic counterparts which influences the sorbed contaminants uptake . Herein we studied the influence of dissolved organic matter on the time resolved sorption of ionic silver Ag

@highlight Ag
@highlight sorption was different between nanoscale plastic debris NPD of different size.
@highlight Ag
@highlight sorption was different between NPD of different composition.
@highlight Dissolved organic matter increased the sorption of Ag
@highlight onto NPD.
@highlight The mixture of polystyrene NPD and Ag
@highlight induced toxicity in daphnids.
