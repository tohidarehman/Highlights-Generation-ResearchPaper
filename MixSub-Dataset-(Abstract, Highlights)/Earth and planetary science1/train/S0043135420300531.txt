 Efficient removal of the non biodegradable organics from the biological effluent of industrial wastewater is becoming more and more important with the increasing demand for stringent discharge regulation . In this study a synchronized oxidation adsorption technology was proposed for the removal of hardly biodegradable COD from the biological effluent of coking wastewater and its performance was verified in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant Q 5 000m

@highlight Synchronized oxidation adsorption SOA could efficiently remove hard COD.
@highlight Hydrolyzed Fe
@highlight particles with large specific surface area can be formed in SOA.
@highlight Carboxylic substances were generated though the oxidation of .OH.
@highlight Large surface area and formation of carboxylic substances were two key factors.
@highlight Full scale application demonstrated the effectiveness of SOA.
