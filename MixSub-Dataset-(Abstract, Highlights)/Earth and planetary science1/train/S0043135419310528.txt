 This study presents a novel periodate oxidation system mediated by manganese oxides for the rapid removal of aqueous contaminants . The catalytic activation of periodate on manganese oxides was demonstrated as an efficient advanced oxidation system for degradation of sulfanilamide . The reactivity of manganese oxides with different Mn valence followed the order of MnO
