 A magnetic levitation based hybrid energy harvester is proposed in this work . The new harvester consists of a tri stable nonlinearity enhanced mechanism that not only enhances the energy transfer through

@highlight A magnetic levitation based hybrid energy harvester is proposed.
@highlight A tri stable mechanism is incorporated to enhance the working efficiency.
@highlight The system works well under low frequency excitation levels 38 Hz and 0.31 g .
@highlight Portable electronics can be driven by the present harvester under low frequencies.
