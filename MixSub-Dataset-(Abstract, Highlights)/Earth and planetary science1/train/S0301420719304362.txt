 This paper identifies the intersecting technical and social factors that have fueled a history of conflict between artisanal and small scale mining and large scale mining and more recently their potential coexistence in Marmato Colombia . At Marmato a vertically zoned ore body and corresponding vertically stacked land claims have in part fueled tensions between ASM and large scale mining . These same characteristics have also given rise to a scenario which could facilitate the coexistence of both parties . The case of Marmato has implications for policy and decision making around relations between ASM and large scale mining elsewhere notably 1 how a politicization of natural hazards can exacerbate existing asymmetries in power wealth and risk 2 some deposit types such as epithermal veins may be particularly suited to coexistence but site specific characteristics determine whether the technically feasible mining methods could facilitate or preclude coexistence 3 how equity is central to successful coexistence and 4 how approaches such as contract mining will need to integrate social and technical considerations .

@highlight Development of a large open pit at Marmato Colombia would remove historic and modern small scale gold mines.
@highlight Politicization of natural hazards during resettlement exacerbated existing asymmetries in power wealth and risk.
@highlight A newly discovered deeper zone is amenable to large scale underground mining.
@highlight Vertically zoned ore deposits may be suited to coexistence.
@highlight Equity is central to the success of coexistence models which should integrate social and technical considerations.
