 Three different natural organic matter loading methods were compared for the adsorptive removal of 2 methylisoborneol by superfine powdered activated carbon and conventionally sized powdered activated carbon . The three NOM loading methods were NOM adsorption followed by MIB MIB adsorption followed by NOM and simultaneous NOM and MIB loading . MIB removals were similar for the smaller sized carbon at higher AC dosages and at lower initial NOM concentrations . The similar MIB removals indicate direct site competition between MIB and NOM with MIB adsorption reversibility . At lower AC doses especially for PACs and at higher initial NOM concentrations the adsorption of MIBs depended on the sequence of MIB or NOM adsorption . MIB removal was lowest for the NOM preloaded carbon followed by NOM simultaneously loaded carbon . The highest MIB removal was achieved by post loading of NOM indicating that the adsorption is irreversible . MIB adsorption on SPAC was more reversible than on PAC although the pore size distributions of the two carbons were similar . The high degree of adsorption irreversibility for PAC compared with SPAC indicated that pore blocking occurs due to NOM loading at the PAC particle surface . Images of the external adsorption were obtained using isotope mapping and

@highlight MIB adsorbed on SPAC was desorbed by NOM up to the adsorption equilibrium.
@highlight MIB adsorbed on conventionally sized PAC was partially desorbed.
@highlight MIB adsorption on SPAC was more reversible than on PAC.
@highlight Irreversible adsorption was caused by pore blockage on the PAC particle surface.
@highlight We observed external adsorption on a PAC particle by using
