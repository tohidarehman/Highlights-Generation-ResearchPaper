 In the bacteria algae system the amount of oxygen produced by the algae is always insufficient for the organic carbon degradation resulting in less inorganic carbon production . Meanwhile the conventional extra aeration method always causes CO

@highlight The membrane aerated based bacteria algae symbiosis system MA BA was proposed.
@highlight The algae boosted as the increase of COD in MA BA.
@highlight Increased COD changed the nutrient removal pathway from bacterial action to algae action.
@highlight RDA suggested that COD concentration was responsible for the algae growth in MA BA system.
