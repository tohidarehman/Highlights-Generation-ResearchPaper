 Monitoring of surface soil moisture through microwave radiometry typically relies on the inversion of a radiative transfer model . Conventional inversion algorithms require proper calibration of surface roughness and radiometric parameters of the overlying canopy including the scattering albedo and optical depth . However uncertainty in global characterization of these parameters is one of the main sources of error in satellite SM retrievals . To cope with this uncertainty this paper presents a new algorithm called temporal polarization ratio algorithm that enables retrieval of SM independent of surface roughness and vegetation parameters . This approach uses the temporal differences of polarized emissivity observations assuming that the surface roughness and vegetation parameters are invariant over a window of time . Unlike the classical dual channel algorithms TPRA is not only free of surface calibration but also robust to systematical errors arising from surface soil temperature errors . One caveat is that the algorithm is unable to retrieve SM when surface emissivity does not change appreciably in time . The performance of TPRA is evaluated through several controlled numerical experiments and validated using the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite retrievals as well as
