 Long term continuous datasets of high quality are important for instrumentation control and automation efforts of wastewater resources recovery facility . This study presents a methodology to increase the reliability of measurements from ammonium ion selective electrodes . This is done by correcting corrupted ISE data with a data source that often is available at WRRFs . A yearlong measurement campaign showed that the existing standard protocols for sensor maintenance might still create corrupted dataset with poor sensor recalibrations responsible for abrupt and unrealistic jumps in the measurements . The proposed automatic correction methodology removes both recalibration jumps and signal drift by using information from composite samples that already are taken for reporting to legal authorities . Results showed that the developed methodology provided a continuous high quality time series without the major data quality issues of the original signal . In fact the signal was improved for 87 of days when a reference sample was available . The effect of correcting the data before use in a data driven software sensor was also investigated . The corrected dataset led to noticeably smaller day to day variations in estimated NH

@highlight Recalibration of A ISE sensors with single grab samples is highly problematic.
@highlight Useful information can be extracted from otherwise problematic corrupted data.
@highlight Merging A ISE observations with composite samples increases data reliability.
@highlight The corrected data gives sharper parameter distributions for a software sensor.
@highlight Eight to sixteen weeks of data are sufficient for training a good software sensor.
