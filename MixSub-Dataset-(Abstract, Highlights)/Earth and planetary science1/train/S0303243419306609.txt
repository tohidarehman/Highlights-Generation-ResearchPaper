 Crop characterization using Compact Pol Synthetic Aperture Radar data is of prime interest with the rapid advancements of SAR systems towards operational applications . It is noteworthy that as a good compromise between the dual and quad polarized SAR systems the CP SAR offer advantages in terms of the larger swath and lower data rate . The

@highlight An improvement is proposed in existing compact pol
