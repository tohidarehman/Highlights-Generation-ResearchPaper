 A method to differentiate open water from sea ice using quad polarization C band synthetic aperture radar imagery is presented based on the roughness properties of the sea surface scattering facets and the polarization ratio between VV and HH polarization backscatter from the SAR images . In quad polarization SAR images the normalized radar cross section which is linked to sea surface roughness can be used to derive the orientation angle shift and its standard deviation as well as to compute the measured polarization ratio PR . An X Bragg backscatter model is explored to calculate a theoretical look up table for the polarization ratio as a function of incidence angle dielectric constant orientation angle shift and its standard deviation . Thus ocean surface backscatter can be identified as open water or sea ice by comparing the measured PR with a theoretical model for PR . The proposed method is validated by comparison to collocated optical video images and manual visual interpretations . Estimates of the size shape and locations of open water from our method are shown to be in good agreement with observed data . The overall accuracy of our algorithm is about 96 . The classification accuracy for sea ice and open water is about 96 and 94 respectively .

@highlight The SAR polarization ratio is affected by roughness of the sea surface.
@highlight Changes in open water and sea ice areas are observed by SAR and helicopter video images.
