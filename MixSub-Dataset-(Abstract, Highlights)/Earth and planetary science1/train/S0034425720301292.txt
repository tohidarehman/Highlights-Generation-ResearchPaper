 Quantifying the spectral variation of column aerosol absorption in the ultraviolet and visible wavelengths is required for accurate satellite based aerosol and trace gas retrievals . Retrievals of the column averaged imaginary part of refractive index and single scattering albedo in the UVVis range have been performed at Yonsei University Seoul Korea since 2016 by combining co located measurements from the NASA Aerosol Robotic Network Cimel sun sky photometer the Ultraviolet Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer the SKYNET Prede sky radiometer and the NASA Pandora sun spectrometer . We investigated the spectral variation of column averaged imaginary part of refractive index for UVVis wavelengths to refine models used in our aerosol retrieval algorithm to process measurements from the upcoming Geostationary Environment Monitoring Satellite . The retrieved imaginary part of refractive index for highly absorbing fine pollution particles dust and non absorbing particles in the selected UVVis range showed 020 30 and 040 of spectral dependence respectively . Retrievals of Ozone Monitoring Instrument measurement data using the improved aerosol model showed improved correlation with AERONET data compared to the old algorithm that did not properly account for aerosol absorption effects . These results corroborate the advantage of using local climatology derived from ground based UVVis spectral aerosol absorption measurements for satellite GEMS aerosol retrievals over East Asia . Moreover this study reveals that spectral variations in the UV column aerosol absorption in East Asia differ from those in other regions .
