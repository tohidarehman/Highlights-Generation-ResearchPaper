 This paper reports an experimental investigation into the behavior of axially loaded steel reinforced concrete columns subjected to impact loads . A total of seven SRC columns with T shaped steel skeleton were prepared and tested using a drop hammer impact system . The testing variables include the impact height stirrup spacing and the axial compression ratio . The impact force time histories and lateral displacements at mid span and quarter span were recorded and analyzed . The experimental results indicated that the decrease of stirrup spacing resulted in a smaller lateral deflection . Axial load was also found to have a strong influence on the residual deflection of columns subjected to impact loading . In addition the finite element analysis models which considers the effects of strain rate of steel and concrete as well as the axial loads were established to simulate the experiment . The FEA results are proved to agree well with that of experiment . The findings obtained from this study can facilitate the application of SRC columns in improving the impact resistant performance of bridge and building columns .

@highlight Seven steel reinforced columns are tested under impact loading.
@highlight Lower stirrup spacing can improve impact resistance of columns.
@highlight Finite element models are developed to simulate the experiments.
@highlight Predicated results have good agreement with test results.
