 White rot fungi have been studied for the removal of micropollutants of emerging concern from wastewater during the last decade . However several issues need to be overcome for its plausible implementation at full scale installations such as the addition of supplementary substrates the partial re inoculation of fresh fungi or the use of extended hydraulic retention times . This work proposes the immobilization of
