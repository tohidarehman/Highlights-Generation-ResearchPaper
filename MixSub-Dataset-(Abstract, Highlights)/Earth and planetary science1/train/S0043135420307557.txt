 Fungal contamination of drinking water sources is increasingly threatening the environment and human health . In this study the inactivation of three genera of dominant fungi in drinking water sources using ozone was first reported . The inactivation of the fungal spores by ozone could be divided into two distinct stages first a rapid reduction in survival and then the inactivation at a slower rate . The secondary stage inactivation fitted the ChickWatson model well and there was no significant difference in the second order inactivation rate constants of the three fungal spores 0.1990.209 L mg

@highlight Ozonation of fungal spores included two stages with different rate constants.
@highlight Increase in temperature and pH accelerated the ozonation of fungal spores.
@highlight Ozone destroyed cell wall and membrane then released the intracellular compounds.
@highlight Ozone was more effective than chlorine and chlorine dioxide in inactivating fungi.
