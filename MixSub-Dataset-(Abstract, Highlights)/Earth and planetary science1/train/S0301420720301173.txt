 This study examines the co movements between price returns of precious metals and non ferrous metals . To do this we use the spillover index developed by Diebold and Yilmaz and various wavelet . The results show that aluminum is the highest contributor to shocks in the other metal markets whereas Lead and copper are the least contributors . Moreover silver copper zinc and Lead are net receivers of shocks while gold and aluminium are net contributors to shocks in the other markets . In addition the trajectory of the spillover index among all metals under investigation is influenced by economic crises . On the other hand the results of wavelet methods reveal strong co movements between precious and non ferrous metals under medium and low frequencies where gold and silver are leading the non ferrous metals . Besides precious metal non ferrous metal pairs are in phase . The results show strong multiscale co movements among non ferrous metals . Gold offers better diversification benefits to non ferrous metals under 24 days . The diversification benefits decrease as scale rise . These findings are interesting and entail significant implications to investors portfolio managers and policy makers to inform their decision making .

@highlight We examine the multiscale co movements and spillovers between precious and non ferrous metals.
@highlight The spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz 2012 and various wavelet methods are employed.
@highlight Silver copper zinc and Lead are net receivers of shocks.
@highlight Strong co movements between precious and non ferrous metals under medium and low frequencies.
@highlight Gold provides highest diversification benefits to non ferrous metals for 24 days.
