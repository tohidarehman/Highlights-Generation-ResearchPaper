 Imaging spectroscopy is a valuable tool for mapping canopy foliar traits in forested ecosystems at landscape and larger scales . Most efforts to date have involved two dimensional mapping of traits typically representing top of canopy conditions . However traits and their associated biological functions vary through the canopy vertical profile such that incorporating information about vertical patterns may improve modeling of ecosystem processes like primary productivity . In 2016 and 2017 we collected extensive field data in forests in Domain 5 of the National Ecological Observatory Network to characterize the vertical variation in leaf mass per area an important foliar trait related to plant growth and defense . Fieldwork was coincident with NEON Airborne Observation Platform overflights which collected imaging spectroscopy and lidar data . Using imaging spectroscopy to map top of canopy LMA and lidar to model vertical gradients of transmittance we developed a method to map three dimensional patterns in LMA in temperate broadleaf forests . Partial least squares regression was used to estimate top of canopy LMA R

@highlight 3D patterns in leaf mass per area are mapped with lidar and imaging spectroscopy.
@highlight Lidar transmittance was strongly correlated with within canopy leaf mass per area.
@highlight Within canopy gradients can be mapped without consideration of species composition.
