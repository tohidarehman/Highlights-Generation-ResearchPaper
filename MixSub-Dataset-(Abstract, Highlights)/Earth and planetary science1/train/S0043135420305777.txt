 Hyporheic zones are hotspots for biogeochemical reactions where groundwater and surface water mix . River dam buildings and other hydrologic controls alter the sediment grain size distribution and modify the downstream hyporheic exchange with cascading effects on geochemical and microbial processes in river corridors . In this lab scale column experiment the N transformations in HZ filled with sediments in different grain sizes were investigated with a focus on understanding the interplay among variational hydraulic connectivity microbial community structure functional potential under frequent groundwatersurface water exchange . Porosity was identified as the main driver determining bacterial community assembly in HZ sediments . Significant microbial zonation was observed along the columns and the degree of co occurrence of bacterial communities in the Fine column was lower than that in the Coarse and Mix columns . The Coarse column allowed for almost 2.47 times the exchange flux relative to the Fine column and generates the fastest DO consumption rate 6.52g O

@highlight Grain size highly affects N transformation dynamics and microbial community assembly.
@highlight The community in turn influences N transformation by exhibiting strong functional zonation.
@highlight Coarse sediment enhances interspecies interaction and stimulates nitrification.
@highlight Confining exchange flux limits nitrogen removal in fine sediment area.
