 Unexplainable concrete softening below the water line has been observed by Sydney Water in their gravity sewer network some of which is subjected to corrosion control methods using chemical ferrous chloride FeCl

@highlight A comprehensive investigation of concrete corrosion below the water line in gravity sewer pipes.
@highlight Neutron tomography is a powerful non destructive technique to detect corrosion.
@highlight Calcium levels can be correlated to hardness and pH in corroded areas.
@highlight Iron uptake in cores from FeCl
@highlight dosed locations in below flow and tidal areas is noticable.
@highlight Softening of the concrete surface exposed to the sewerage occurs in all samples.
