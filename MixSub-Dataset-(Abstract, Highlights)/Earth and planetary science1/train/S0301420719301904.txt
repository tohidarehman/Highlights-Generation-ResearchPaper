 In this paper we investigate the effect of cost misreporting of extractive firms on the optimal design of tax policies . We build a two period two country model where governments aim to attract a foreign owned multinational firm to raise tax revenues by levying a profit tax and a royalty . The firm overstates its production costs to reduce declared profits and it decides in which country to locate . We find that cost overstatement pushes royalties upward but remains detrimental for tax revenues as well as the capital invested by the firm . The mining country that attracts the extractive firm is often the country with the highest coefficient of overstatement . However the firm may locate in the country with the lowest overstatement and lowest royalty if both countries have the same profit tax . Reinforcing expertise in mining sectors to reduce asymmetries of information between firms and tax authorities appears to be a priority in developing resource countries .
