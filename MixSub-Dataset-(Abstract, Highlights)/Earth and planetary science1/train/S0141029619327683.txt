 This paper presents a summary of the experimental programmes and theoretical analysis of the bending performance of non prestressed and prestressed timber concrete composite beams . Two non prestressed and three prestressed composite beams were selected and their flexural behaviour was evaluated . Three types of ductile fabricated connections were applied to the prestressed composite beams whereas two types were applied to the non prestressed beams . The concrete slabs with embedded steel plates and timber beams were connected together using coach screws . On the surfaces of the embedded steel plates the portions in contact with the wooden beam were interspaced with a vulcanized rubber layer to improve the mechanical performance of shear connections and composite beams . A series of four point bending experiments were performed until collapse failure occurred in a simply supported scheme . The test results demonstrated that the TCC beams using steel plate screw connections exhibited excellent structural performance . The flexural capacity of the prestressed specimens was improved by approximately 110 compared with the non prestressed specimens . Due to the addition of the rubber layer in the TCC connections the flexural capacity of the prestressed composite beams was improved by 25.2 . Based on the method a theoretical analysis was proposed for calculating the flexural capacity and bending stiffness for both non prestressed and prestressed TCC beams . The theoretical results showed good agreement with the experimental evidence .
