 Quenching and tempering is a highly developed heat treatment method to produce high strength steels with certain quantities of expensive alloy elements . This process has been highly industrialized and widely adopted in modern steel mills to produce high strength S690 steels . However a heating cooling cycle induced during welding may initiate phase transformation re crystallization and grain growth in microstructures of these steels . This will cause a significant reduction in their mechanical properties if both the maximum temperatures during welding and the cooling rates after welding are not properly controlled . Over the past twenty years conflicting research findings have been reported on mechanical properties of these S690 welded sections due to different welding procedures and parameters adopted during welding .

@highlight Adverse effects of welding on mechanical properties of high strength S690 steel welded joints are quantified.
@highlight Experimental evidence on structural adequacy of these S690 welded joints is provided.
@highlight Pilot tests on 18 coupons of S690 welded joints under tension were conducted to examine their deformation characteristics.
@highlight 12 reference and 12 spliced S690 welded H sections with different heat input energy were tested under compression.
@highlight By proper control on heat input energy during welding little or no reduction in the mechanical properties of S690 welded joints is found.
