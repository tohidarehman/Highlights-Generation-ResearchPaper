 The natural world has multiple sometimes conflicting sometimes synergistic values to society when viewed through the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals Spatial mapping of nature s contributions to the SDGs has the potential to support the implementation of SDG strategies through sustainable land management and conservation of ecosystem services . Such mapping requires a range of spatial data . This paper examines the use of remote sensing and spatial ecosystem service modelling to examine nature s contribution to targets under SDG 6 also highlighting synergies with other key SDGs and trade offs with agriculture .

@highlight Existing EO datasets can underpin spatial analyses of nature s contributions to SDGs.
@highlight Such analyses indicate within and between country variability in nature s contribution.
@highlight A spatial prioritisation suggests the highest priority areas for investment.
@highlight Ubiquitous EO data enable globally consistent and geographically comprehensive analyses.
@highlight Challenges remain in using EO data for multi factor models like these.
