 This paper examines the causality between crude oil exports crude oil prices and military expenditures over the period from 1980 to 2016 for the seven OPEC countries . A panel Granger causality test suggested by Dumitrescu and Hurlin is applied as bivariate and trivariate analysis separately . Five of six bivariate causality analyses show the existence of panel Granger causality . The test also shows that there is panel Granger causality running from crude oil exports and crude oil prices to military expenditures from crude oil exports and military expenditures to crude oil prices and from military expenditures and crude oil prices to crude oil exports as a result of trivariate analysis . It is concluded that some OPEC countries examined in the study transferred some of their oil revenues to military expenditures that are considered economically inefficient . Moreover it is concluded that the link between oil revenues and military spending depends on the political independence geographical location and or the threat of terrorism and war for each country .

@highlight The advanced econometric techniques are used to make analysis.
@highlight The joint causality effect from two variables to one variable is examined as a contribution to the literature.
@highlight Future projections crude oil exports should regard other factors besides crude oil prices.
@highlight The political independence geographical location and or the threat of terrorism and war are important factors.
