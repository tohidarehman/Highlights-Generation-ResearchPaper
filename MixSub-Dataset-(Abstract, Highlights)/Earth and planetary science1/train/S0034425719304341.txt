 Increasing evidence suggests that ecosystem functions are strongly linked to morphological plant traits like specific leaf area and its variability which serve as a proxy of functional diversity . Functional diversity is rarely studied at regional scales and its scale dependence is poorly understood . Capturing trait variations at distinct spatial scales and in differently managed grasslands remains challenging mainly because a limited number of trait measurements are available and field campaigns are time consuming . Here we derived and FD indices based on SLA measured in the field and estimated from optical satellite data by using molecular absorption profiles of leaves in canopies . We inverted the 1 D columnar radiative transfer model PROSAIL using Sentinel 2 reflectance data at canopy level . From the inversion we were able to distinguish different alpine management types based on retrieved SLA . Model uncertainties were mainly related to the different local plant communities here represented by functional diversity indices and community weighted means of traits . Thus successful PROSAIL application was affected by management type . Management categories displaying lower FD like
