 A new algorithm called combined constrained multi channel algorithm is presented for simultaneous retrieval of soil moisture and vegetation optical depth in L band with improved resolution . Unlike widely used algorithms the new approach optimally fuses multiple sources of surface temperatures into the inversion process and confines the retrievals to their feasible climatological range rather than the mean and paves the way to account for the slow changes of VOD through a Sobolev norm regularization . Through controlled numerical experiments that assume a random error in the surface temperatures it is shown that the algorithm can decrease the root mean squared error by 78 and 81 when compared with the unconstrained version and 54 and 7 when a single source of surface temperature is used in retrievals of SM and VOD respectively . The use of the Sobolev norm regularization decreases the RMSE by more than 25 at the expense of a negligible bias . Implementation of the algorithm using data from the NASA s Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite in 2016 demonstrates that the monthly RMSE of SM retrievals improves by more than 6 when compared with the SMAP enhanced products considering the ground measurements from the International SM Network as a reference while the monthly RMSE of VOD decreases by more than 62 when compared with the VOD climatology used in the SMAP SCA products . Analysis of the results demonstrates that without increasing the native resolution of radiometric observations the information content of the
