 Microalgae mediated biodegradation of antibiotics has recently gained increased attention from international scientific community . However limited information is available regarding microalgae mediated biodegradation of SMX in a co metabolic system . Here we investigated the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole by five algal species

@highlight Five algal species were screened for biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole SMX .
@highlight showed the highest dissipation capacity of SMX.
@highlight The dissipation efficiency of SMX was enhanced with the addition of sodium acetate.
@highlight Fifteen TPs from phase I and phase II reactions were identified by UPLC QTOF MS.
@highlight The co metabolic pathway of SMX by
@highlight was firstly proposed.
