 Cross laminated timber is becoming popular in the North American construction market as a feasible option for mid to high rise timber buildings . CLT shear walls are effective in resisting lateral forces resulting from wind and seismic loads and design standards allow to estimate their capacity . These standards however do no not include provisions to estimate the deflection of CLT shear walls . In this paper formulas are proposed to estimate the in plane deflection for single and coupled walls in platform type buildings under lateral loading based on the assumed kinematic behaviour . It is postulated that the perpendicular walls and the floors above the shear walls also influence the in plane deflection . Therefore in addition to the CLT panel and the connection contributions also the contributions of perpendicular walls and floors above are accounted for . A parameter study evaluates the influence of connection including those to perpendicular wall and walls above on the total deflection of single and coupled CLT shear walls . The proposed equations to estimate the deflection of CLT shear walls under lateral loads are compared against full scale tests and the good agreement suggest that the formulae can be applied in the design of CLT platform type buildings .

@highlight Analytical equations were proposed to estimate the lateral in plane deflection of Cross Laminated Timber CLT shear walls.
@highlight Both single and coupled CLT walls with brackets hold downs and screws connections were considered.
@highlight Rocking or combined rocking and sliding behaviour of single and coupled CLT walls were investigated.
@highlight The contribution of perpendicular walls and floors were considered.
@highlight The proposed equations were compared against experimental results which showed good agreement.
