 Model updating hybrid tests were conducted to reveal the seismic behaviour of a typical reinforced concrete rigid frame thin walled tall pier bridge . The bottom of the left pier was isolated and experimentally tested in a laboratory as a physical substructure and the rest of the bridge was simulated as a numerical substructure . The parameters of the concrete constitutive model were identified online based on the experimental data of the PS and refreshed to the NS to correct their values during the test . Then test results of the PS involving crack developments and the failure mode were obtained and compared to other quasi static tests . Moreover the high order effect was analysed based on the verified NS data . Finally a method to predict the failure mode of bridges with thin walled tall piers is presented in view of the phenomenon that such bridges are prone to shear dominant brittle failure . In this method new formulas of aspect ratio are proposed in both a broad and a narrow sense by considering the thin walled effect and high order modes . The newly proposed method was then used to predict the failure mode of the target bridge pier and the piers provided by other tests . The results show that the failure modes predicted by the proposed method are consistent with that observed from the tests .
