 The main plant of steel reinforced concrete structure is proposed for CAP1400 nuclear power plant in high seismic zone which not only has better mechanical properties than reinforced concrete structure plant but also has lower maintenance cost than steel structure plant . The irregular SRC joints are inevitably appeared in the main plant due to the limitations of power generation technology and equipment . In this paper quasi static cyclic tests were carried out on three 1 4 reduced scale irregular external SRC joints to discuss the seismic performance of the joints in the NPP mainly including the damage pattern hysteretic behavior load carrying capacity stiffness degradation and ductility . In addition the detailed 3D finite element models were established in which the bond slip behavior between the shaped steel and concrete was considered by using the developed software to add a huge number of non linear spring elements and the FE models were verified by the test results . Then the parametric study on seismic performance of irregular external SRC joint was carried out and the influence of each parameter on the seismic performance of the irregular external SRC joint was analyzed . Finally the effective and economical reinforcement measures were proposed and verified by the FE method .
