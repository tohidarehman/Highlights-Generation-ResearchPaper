 Sulfidated nano zerovalent iron stabilized with carboxymethyl cellulose was successfully synthesized on site and injected into the subsurface at a site contaminated with a broad range of chlorinated volatile organic compounds . Transport of CMC S nZVI to the monitoring wells both downgradient and upgradient resulted in a significant decrease in concentrations of aqueous phase cVOCs . Short term total boron and chloride measurements indicated dilution and displacement in these wells . Importantly however compound specific isotope analysis changes in concentrations of intermediates and increase in ethene concentrations confirmed dechlorination of cVOCs . Dissolution from the DNAPL pool into the aqueous phase at the deepest levels was identifiable from the increased cVOCs concentrations during long term monitoring . However at the uppermost levels a contrasting trend was observed indicating successful dechlorination . Changes in cVOCs concentrations and CSIA data suggest both sequential hydrogenolysis as well as reductive elimination as the possible transformation mechanisms during the short term abiotic and long term biotic dechlorination . One of the most positive outcomes of this CMC S nZVI field treatment is the non accumulation of lower chlorinated VOCs particularly vinyl chloride . Post treatment soil cores also revealed significant decreases in cVOCs concentrations throughout the targeted treatment zones . Results from this field study show that sulfidation is a suitable amendment for developing more efficient nZVI based

@highlight CMC S nZVI was applied for the first time at a site contaminated with a mixture of cVOCs.
@highlight Compound specific isotope analysis CSIA confirmed the transformation of aqueous cVOCs.
@highlight Unlike nZVI there was no accumulation of lower cVOCs particularly VC in the long term degradation.
@highlight CMC S nZVI treatment resulted in significant reduction of sorbed phase cVOCs.
