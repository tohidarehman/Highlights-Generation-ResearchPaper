 Activation of persulfates and peroxymonosulfate by nanoscale zero valent iron is reported to be effective in oxidative treatment of environmental contaminants . It has been widely accepted in numerous literature that sulfate radical SO

@highlight Relative contribution of Fe IV is positively correlated with PMS dosage.
@highlight The increase of pH lead to the decrease of the relative contribution of Fe IV .
