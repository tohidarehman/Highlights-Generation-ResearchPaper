 Rapid industrialization and urbanization has led to a rapid increase in global embodied metal trading across the globe and simultaneously the demand to study the complex trade activities among various economies has also increased . Responding to this demand this paper selected the world multi regional input output table in 2009 as the bases for its attempt to explore global embodied metal flows in international trade by a combination of multi regional input output analysis and complex network analysis . Then we applied the complex network theory to study the structural characteristics of the global embodied metal flow network . The results show that firstly the global metal flow network has obvious small world nature . One department only needs 2.702 steps to reach any other department in the network . Secondly there are 10 communities in the network which is highly correlated with the existing economic organizations . Thirdly sectors weights among networks are very uneven . Some sectors are extremely important to a national economy other do not . For example China s Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal is second to none in terms of scope and intensity of influence . Fourthly only 0.45 of flows account for 90 of the total embodied metal from a sectoral perspective while 77.68 are intra traded within economies from a regional perspective . Finally some policy suggestions are given according to different economies and sectors .

@highlight Global embodied metal flow network GEMFN presents small world nature.
@highlight The GEMFN is constructed to observe indirect metal flows based on MRIO table.
@highlight Distribution of communities is highly related to existing economic and trade relations.
@highlight Significant nodes in GEMFN are identified by degree weighted degree and centrality.
@highlight Significant edges in GEMFN are identified from sectoral and regional perspectives.
