 While microplastics contamination is creating public concern nanoplastics might create even more serious environmental contamination issues . This is likely due to the smaller size higher specific surface area of nanoplastics which works more efficiently as a vector for other contaminants transportation and fate to release the formulation additives and to be accumulated in the human body . The research on nanoplastics is currently hampered by the absence of an effective characterisation method although X ray photoelectron spectroscopy Scanning Electron Microscopy is reportedly dominating the nanoplastics characterisation approaches . Recently imaging technology which provides direct visualisation of the targets is attracting increased attention . In this study we demonstrate that Raman imaging can be employed to visualise and identify microplastics and nanoplastics down to 100nm by distinguishing the laser spot the pixel size image resolution the nanoplastics size position the Raman signal intensity and via the sample preparation etc . We also validate this technique for the analysis of paint polishing dust samples that have been collected from a driveway when a vehicles clear coating of poly acrylic was polished by hand . We estimate that billions trillions of microplastics nanoplastics ranging from 7m down to 200nm have been generated by hand polishing an engine hood .
