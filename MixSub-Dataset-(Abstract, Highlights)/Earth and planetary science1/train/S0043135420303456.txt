 Biofilm community of bacteria ubiquitously present in natural environment may interact with plastic particles and affect the transport of plastic particles in environment . The significance of biofilm

@highlight Biofilm increases the deposition of NPs and MPs in porous media.
@highlight Narrowed flow path and increased surface roughness enhances plastics deposition.
@highlight Three major components of extracellular polymeric substances have contribution.
@highlight Plastic particles are more tightly retained in biofilm coated sand than clean sand.
