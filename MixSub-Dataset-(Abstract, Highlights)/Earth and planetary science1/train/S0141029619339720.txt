 Fiber reinforced polymer composites have become widely accepted in the strengthening or seismic retrofitting of reinforced concrete columns in practice . FRP confined rectangular concrete columns under concentric axial compression have been extensively studied leading to many stress strain models . Although RC columns in practical structures are commonly subjected to combined axial compression and bending existing research on eccentrically loaded FRP confined rectangular RC columns has been much more limited . More specifically the limited research available has generally been concerned with small scale RC columns and the applicability of existing concentric loading stress strain models for FRP confined concrete in the analysis of large scale eccentrically loaded rectangular RC columns has not been properly clarified . This paper presents the results of an experimental study including eight large scale FRP confined rectangular RC columns tested under eccentric compression . The following key test variables were carefully examined in the experimental program the load eccentricity the direction of bending and the FRP jacket thickness . A theoretical column model is then presented for predicting the responses of the test columns . It is shown that the direct use of a concentric loading stress strain model for FRP confined concrete in the column model leads to significant errors in predicting the ultimate deformation of the test columns .
