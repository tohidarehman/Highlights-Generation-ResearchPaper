 The integrity of the drinking water infrastructure deteriorates with time . Monitoring the condition of the drinking water mains can enhance the remaining operational lifetime assessment of the network . In this research a method to translate ultrasonic signals to degradation levels from an inline inspection in a cement based drinking water pipeline is proposed . The data was obtained from an inspection performed in a Dutch drinking main section . The data is processed in two major steps . Firstly the parameters that provide the condition of the cement are extracted . Secondly images of the degradation within the pipes of the inspected trajectory were generated . The main contributions in this paper are the estimation of relative degradation levels of a cement based pipeline based on the ultrasonic pulse echo technique and the upscaling of the processing method in an automated manner for visualization of the degraded condition . Lastly a sensitivity study of the parameters relevant to the determination of the degraded depth has been performed . The speed of sound in cement is the most relevant parameter to consider . Estimating absolute degradation levels needs further study .

@highlight Estimation of degradation levels in a cement based pipeline.
@highlight The extent of degradation along the inspection trajectory is consistent.
@highlight The extent of degradation along the circumference differs.
@highlight The speed of sound in cement has the highest sensitivity for estimating the degradation levels.
