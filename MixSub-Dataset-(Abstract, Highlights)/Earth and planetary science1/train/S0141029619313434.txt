 Underground mining extraction causes deformation of the rock mass and the surface which may cause damage to the construction of manholes thus leading to the failure of the sewage system . To ensure the proper operation of sewer systems in mining areas it is important to consider the interaction between the manhole and the horizontally strained soil . The impact of continuous mining deformations of the ground around the manhole manifests itself through the impact of horizontal strains which mainly affect the manhole riser . These strains cause the horizontal cross sectional deflection of the flexible manhole riser which is made of thermoplastics .

@highlight Mining extraction has a negative impact on utility networks including manholes.
@highlight Soil structure interaction in mining subsidence area needs to be taken into account.
@highlight Soil strains lead to the cross sectional deflection of a flexible manhole riser.
@highlight Manhole deflection depends on soil strains ring stiffness and foundation depth.
