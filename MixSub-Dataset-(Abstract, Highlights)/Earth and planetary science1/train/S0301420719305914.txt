 The cross regional interconnected power grid leading the development of our country has a complex and lengthy evolution process that is influenced by numerous factors . It is an enormous challenge to propose a model that analyzes the evolution of CRIG . Therefore the main objective of this study is to explore the evolutionary characteristics of CRIG by developing a complex network model . The results show that policy guidance has a significant impact on the evolution of China s CRIG and that given this influence the degree of CRIG distribution will have an edge multi core shape and the network density will show an inverted N curve shape . In addition we analyze the development trends in China s which will achieve a simpler construction namely the levels of CRIG connections and the community effect will gradually fade over the CRIG evolution . Finally we believe that renewable energy and micro grid and electricity markets are the direct cause of structural changes occurring in China s CRIG . More attention should be paid to the security and coordination of cross regional power grids to achieve interconnections in the future .

@highlight An evolutionary model is constructed by integrating security economic constraints and complex network theory.
@highlight The evolutionary law of cross regional interconnected power grid CRIG is revealed at the network development level.
@highlight The evolutionary trend of future CRIG is identified based on proposed evolutionary model.
