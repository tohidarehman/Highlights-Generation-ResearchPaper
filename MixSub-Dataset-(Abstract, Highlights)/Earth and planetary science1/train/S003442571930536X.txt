 The remote sensing of algal pigments is essential for understanding the temporal and spatial distribution of harmful algal blooms . In particular the vertical distribution of cyanobacterial pigment is critical factor in remote sensing because the diel vertical migration of cyanobacteria may affect the spectral signals according to observational time . Although numerous studies have been conducted on the remote sensing of algal bloom using pigments few studies considered the vertical distribution of the pigments for the remote sensing of cyanobacteria in inland waters . In this regard the objective of this study was to develop an improved bio optical remote sensing method using in situ remote sensing reflectance at different water depths and cumulative PC and Chlorophyll a concentrations which was cumulated from the surface to a 5 m water depth . The results showed that the bio optical algorithm using surface Rrs and surface pigment concentration was more accurate than that using the subsurface Rrs and surface pigments . The bio optical algorithm using subsurface Rrs showed the highest R squared R

@highlight Cumulative pigment and subsurface Rrs were used to construct bio optical algorithms.
@highlight Vertical cumulative pigment concentration was highly correlated with subsurface Rrs.
@highlight PC map was developed using drone hyperspectral imagery and cumulative concentration.
@highlight Relative abundance of PC was readily detectable by cumulative PC distribution map.
