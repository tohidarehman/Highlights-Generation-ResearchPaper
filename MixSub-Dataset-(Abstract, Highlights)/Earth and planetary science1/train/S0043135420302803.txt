 In order to understand and minimize the formation of halogenated disinfection by products it is important to investigate how dissolved organic matter contributes to their generation . In the present study we analysed the DOM profile of water samples from the Barcelona catchment area by high resolution mass spectrometry and we studied the changes after chlorination . Chlorination produced significant changes in the DOM decreased the average m z and Kendrick mass defect of their spectra and decreased the number and abundance of lignin like features . The Van Krevelen fingerprint exhibited several noticeable changes including the appearance of highly oxidized peaks in the tannin like region the appearance of features with low H C and the disappearance of more than half of the lipids like features . Up to 657 halogenated peaks were generated during sample chlorination most of which in the condensed hydrocarbons like and the lignin like region of the VK diagram .

@highlight  650 halogenated features were generated during sample chlorination.
@highlight Water chlorination decreased the number and abundance of lignin like features.
@highlight Most halogenated DBPs appeared in the lignin and condensed hydrocarbon like regions.
@highlight Certain
@highlight  containing lignin like features correlate with the formation of HAN.
@highlight Certain lignin like features with no nitrogen correlate with the formation of THMs.
