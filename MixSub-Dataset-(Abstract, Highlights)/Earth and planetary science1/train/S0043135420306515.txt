 Studies of dissolved organic matter composition have used several different methods to concentrate and extract the DOM from fresh water but the impact of these methods on the composition of the DOM is relatively unknown as very few studies use more than one method to compare results . The aim of this study was to use several methods frequently used in the scientific literature to concentrate and extract DOM from fresh water and compare the elemental and functional group composition of the extracted DOM . In addition the cost in terms of money resources and time were assessed for each method . The results showed that the elemental and functional group composition of the extracted DOM varied between methods significantly . The methods that yielded the most similar and reproducible DOM results were rotary evaporation dry down at 60C and freeze drying . Although each of these methods required a relatively expensive piece of laboratory equipment this was a one off cost and consumables and time per sample were relatively low . This study highlights the dangers of comparing DOM data from different studies when the DOM has been extracted via different methods . In future it is recommended that studies of DOM composition report their methods of extraction clearly and consistently ideally using one of the methods showing reliable results here .

@highlight Methods of extracting dissolved organic matter from freshwaters vary in efficiency.
@highlight Dissolved organic matter was extracted from freshwaters in the UK.
@highlight Several methods were evaluated and the time cost and results of each assessed.
@highlight Rotary evaporation freeze drying and dry down gave the most consistent results.
