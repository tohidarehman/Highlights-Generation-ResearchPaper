 Pharmaceuticals and personal care products an emerging class of highly recalcitrant water contaminants have raised considerable concerns in environment community . Graphitic carbon nitride has shown a great potential towards the photodegradation of water contaminants under visible light irradiation . However the conventional bulk CN presents the amorphous structure resulting in an inefficient yield of hydroxyl radicals for the complete mineralization of PPCPs . This study provides fundamental insights into significantly enhancing the hydroxyl radical generation via improving the crystallinity of the pristine CN materials . Experimental measurements and accompanying density functional theory computational analysis suggest that the crystalline carbon nitride exhibited an enhanced adsorption ability towards the dissolved O

@highlight Crystalline carbon nitrides CCN exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity.
@highlight Pharmaceuticals and personal care products PPCPs were readily degraded by CCN.
@highlight Photocatalytic degradation of PPCPs in natural water matrix was enabled by CCN.
@highlight CCN presents a higher yield of H
