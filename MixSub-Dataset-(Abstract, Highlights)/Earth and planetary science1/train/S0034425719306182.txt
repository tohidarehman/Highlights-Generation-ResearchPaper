 Remote sensing derived cropland products have depicted the location and extent of agricultural lands with an ever increasing accuracy . However limited attention has been devoted to distinguishing between actively cropped fields and fallowed fields within agricultural lands and in particular so in grass fallow systems of semi arid areas . In the Sahel one of the largest dryland regions worldwide crop fallow rotation practices are widely used for soil fertility regeneration . Yet little is known about the extent of fallow fields since fallow is not explicitly differentiated within the cropland class in any existing remote sensing based land use cover maps regardless of the spatial scale . With a 10m spatial resolution and a 5 day revisit frequency Sentinel 2 satellite imagery made it possible to disentangle agricultural land into cropped and fallow fields facilitated by Google Earth Engine for big data handling . Here we produce the first Sahelian fallow field map at a 10m resolution for the baseline year 2017 accomplished by designing a remote sensing driven protocol for generating reference data for mapping over large areas . Based on the 2015 Copernicus Dynamic Land Cover map at 100m resolution the extent of fallow fields in the cropland class is estimated to be 63 403 617km

@highlight Mapping of the land use class fallow field was developed.
@highlight An RS based approach for creating large scale reference data was designed.
@highlight A Sahel scale crop fallow field map was produced at a 10m resolution for 2017.
@highlight Fallow fields remarkably occupy 603 of Sahelian cropland areas.
@highlight Shares of crop fallow fields were analyzed using rainfall and woody cover.
