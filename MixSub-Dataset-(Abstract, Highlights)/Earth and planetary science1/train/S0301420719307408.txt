 In this paper we examine how Google trends can influence the predictability of the most traded precious metals namely Gold Palladium Platinum and Silver . We construct a predictive model that simultaneously accounts for conditional heteroscedasticity due to the use of high frequency data endogeneity bias due to probable exclusion of important predictors and persistence due to the dynamic behaviour of economic agents . We also allow for asymmetry in Google trends to explain positive and negative worded news in the predictability of precious metals . The G trends series appears to positively and significantly impact the returns accruable to the considered precious metals and its inclusion in the predictive model outperforms the random walk model . Also additional information from other macroeconomic variables as well as the negative and positive partial sums of G trends significantly improve the predictive performance of the single predictor G trends based model for precious metals . On robustness while we find consistency of model forecast performance both in the in sample and out of sample forecast periods and across global factors employed our results seem to be dependent on the choice of precious metal being predicted .

@highlight The predictability of Google trends in returns of precious metals is evaluated.
@highlight An augmented autoregressive distributed lag model that accounts for salient features is formulated.
@highlight G trends record consistent positive correlations with the return series precious metals.
@highlight The inclusion of asymmetry and macroeconomic variables improves the G trend based model for precious metals.
@highlight The overall performance of a G trend based predictive model is dependent on the choice of precious metals.
