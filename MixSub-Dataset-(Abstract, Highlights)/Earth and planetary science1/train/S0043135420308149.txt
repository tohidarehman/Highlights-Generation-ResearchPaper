 There is a societal expectation that drinking water owners and operators will successfully manage drinking water quality incidents so they do not become a disaster . However human errors have contributed to causing and worsening drinking water quality incidents worldwide . Personnel tasked with managing drinking water quality incidents need to be prepared . This preparation often occurs in exercises that simulate how a team would respond to a drinking water quality incident . It is our opinion that exercises simulating drinking water quality incidents must shift from a design that is primarily to simulate an intervention to one that promotes conditions for learning and enhances the human centric capabilities of those involved . Traditional exercises invariably seek to test the response to a water quality incident and the actions of those involved often for regulatory purposes . This approach is necessary but can also provide a negative experience for the exercise participants as their actions are frequently scrutinised after the exercise . We offer a strategy to complement traditional approaches to drinking water quality exercises . Central to this is the inclusion of structured training sessions that provide guidance and support throughout an exercise . This can foster a strong learning environment than exercises or training sessions alone . The benefit to water owners and operators is enhanced preparedness and potential mitigation of future drinking water quality disasters .
