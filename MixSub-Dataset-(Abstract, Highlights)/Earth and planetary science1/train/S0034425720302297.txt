 Urban land use is often characterized based on the presence of built up land while the land use intensity of different locations is ignored . This narrow focus is at least partially due to a lack of data on the vertical dimension of urban land . The potential of Earth observation data to fill this gap has already been shown but this has not yet been applied at large spatial scales . This study aims to map urban 3D building structure i.e . building footprint height and volume for Europe the US and China using random forest models . Our models perform well as indicated by R

@highlight We present the first 3D building structure for Europe the US and China.
@highlight Building footprint height and volume are mapped at a 1km
@highlight resolution.
@highlight Our random forest models are very robust with R
@highlight values higher than 0.81.
@highlight The spatial pattern of 3D building structure differs across case study regions.
