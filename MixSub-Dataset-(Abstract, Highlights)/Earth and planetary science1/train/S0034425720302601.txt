 The eutrophication problems in lakes on the Yangtze Plain of China have attracted global concern . However a comprehensive assessment of the eutrophication status and its evolution is still lacking for these regional lakes mostly because of technical difficulties and or insufficient data to cover the large region . Our study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by using the entire archive of remote sensing images from two satellite ocean color missions and Ocean and Land Color Instrument or OLCI together with in situ data on remote sensing reflectance and chlorophyll a concentrations across various lakes on the Yangtze Plain . A machine learning based piecewise Chla algorithm was developed in this study with special considerations to improve algorithm performance under lower Chla conditions . Remotely sensed Chla and algal bloom areas were then used to classify the eutrophication status of 50 large lakes on the Yangtze Plain and the frequent satellite observations enabled us to estimate the probability of eutrophication occurrence for each examined lake . The long term mean Chla ranged from 17.58mgm

@highlight We developed a machine learning based Chla algorithm for Yangtze Plain lakes.
@highlight Chla and algal bloom areas were used to classify eutrophication in 50 lakes.
@highlight Our results show a high probability of eutrophication in Yangtze Plain lakes.
@highlight We found an overall improvement in water quality of these lakes.
