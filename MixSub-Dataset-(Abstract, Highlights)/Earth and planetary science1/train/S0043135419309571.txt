 Lubricant oil discharge from ships has been widely considered as normal operational consumption but is now deemed to be oil pollution . Despite the chronic contamination of the marine environment by lube oil the number of studies related to its environmental impact characteristics and toxicity is limited . This study is the first attempt to investigate the environmental fate of lube oil subjected to photooxidation using in situ mesocosms . A tiered approach using thin layer chromatographyflame ionization detection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatographymass spectrometry demonstrated compositional changes in lube oil and the water soluble fraction . Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in lube oil after 96h of photooxidation were measured at 79.8 and 41g g in the control and exposure groups respectively . Meanwhile the PAHs concentration in WSF after 96h was very low at 0.25 and 0.45g L in Con and Exp respectively . FTIR and GCMS helped identify bond changes and photoproducts in WSF . A wide range of photoproducts including carboxylic acids esters anhydrides aldehydes and ketones were identified in WSF . Toxic effects of WSF in both the Con and Exp groups obtained after 96h of photooxidation were evaluated on olive flounder
