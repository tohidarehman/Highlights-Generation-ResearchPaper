 A primary challenge in cloud detection is associated with highly mixed scenes that are filled with broken and thin clouds over inhomogeneous land . To tackle this challenge we developed a new algorithm called the Random Forest based cloud mask which can improve the accuracy of cloud identification from Landsat Thematic Mapper Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor images . For the development and validation of the algorithm we first chose the stratified sampling method to pre select cloudy and clear sky pixels to form a prior pixel database according to the land use cover around the world . Next we select typical spectral channels and calculate spectral indices based on the spectral reflection characteristics of different land cover types using the top of atmosphere reflectance and brightness temperature . These are then used as inputs to the RF model for training and establishing a preliminary cloud detection model . Finally the Super pixels Extracted via Energy Driven Sampling segmentation approach is applied to re process the preliminary classification results in order to obtain the final cloud detection results . The RFmask detection results are evaluated against the globally distributed United States Geological Survey cloud cover assessment validation products . The average overall accuracy for RFmask cloud detection reaches 93.8
