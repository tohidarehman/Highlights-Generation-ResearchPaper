 Manganese is a necessary and irreplaceable metal resource for the steelmaking industry . The essentiality and non substitutability make the vulnerability to supply restriction of manganese nonnegligible . With this concern this study was conducted to present a global trade linked material flow analysis model of manganese for the year of 2017 to provide deep insight into its flow pattern . Using the MFA model the global manganese flow in 305 categories of commodities within 249 countries was mapped . The results showed that 23.9 million tons of manganese were supplied and used in 2017 . An estimated 27.9Mt of manganese contained in various commodities was traded between countries 38 of which was contributed by the top ten trade flows . China South Africa Australia Brazil Gabon the USA India Japan and Germany were the nine most important members of the global manganese trade flow community . The lack of a system for the complete recovery of Mn from end of life products and slag and a trend towards increasing geographic concentration of Mn ore supplies were identified as two areas of potential risk and concern . Corresponding policy recommendations are proposed to resolve these concerns . A more integrated recovery system of manganese needs to be considered particularly for the developing lithium ion battery applications . Establishment of national reserve needs to be put on the agenda for the large manganese consumers . High supply concentration of manganese refining and manufacturing stage which is dominated by China may need to be changed when prospective global manganese consumption structure changes .

@highlight Global manganese flow for the year of 2017 was mapped.
@highlight The supply concentration of midstream processing link of manganese industry chain is relatively high.
@highlight Establishment of a functional closed loop supply chain for manganese is essential.
