 The degradation of tetrabromobisphenol A one of the most widely used brominated flame retardant was evaluated during peroxymonosulfate oxidation . TBBPA degradation was pH dependent with peak degradation rate constants occurring at pH 8.09.0 which was distinct from some other phenolic compounds . Singlet oxygen and radicals were found to play negligible roles in TBBPA degradation . TBBPA oxidation by PMS mainly proceeded via a direct oxidation pathway and the in situ formed HOBr was found to greatly accelerate its degradation rates . The values of species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of PMS with the TBBPA k

@highlight TBBPA had peak degradation rates at pH 89 during PMS oxidation.
@highlight TBBPA was oxidized by PMS via direct oxidation pathways.
@highlight The in situ formed HOBr greatly accelerated the degradation of TBBPA.
@highlight PMS oxidation of TBBPA involved scission and debromination.
