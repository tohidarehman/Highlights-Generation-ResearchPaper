 Providing accurate information on fire effects is critical to understanding post fire ecological processes and to design appropriate land management strategies . Multispectral imagery from optical passive sensors is commonly used to estimate fire damage yet this type of data is only sensitive to the effects in the upper canopy . This paper evaluates the sensitivity of full waveform LiDAR data to estimate the severity of wildfires using a 3D radiative transfer model approach . The approach represents the first attempt to evaluate the effect of different fire impacts i.e . changes in vegetation structure as well as soil and leaf color on the LiDAR signal . The FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model was employed to simulate full waveform data for 10 plots representative of Mediterranean ecosystems along with a wide range of post fire scenarios characterized by different severity levels as defined by the composite burn index . A new metric is proposed the waveform area relative change which provides a comprehensive severity assessment considering all strata and accounting for changes in structure and leaf and soil color . It showed a strong correlation with CBI values outperforming the relative change of LiDAR metrics commonly applied for vegetation modeling such as the relative height of energy quantiles . Logarithmic models fitted for each plot based on the WARC yielded very good performance with R

@highlight The potential of LiDAR to estimate fire damage is assessed using a 3D RTM approach.
@highlight The new metric WARC provides a comprehensive evaluation of severity.
@highlight The WARC outperformed common LiDAR metrics used for vegetation modeling.
@highlight The robustness and generalization power of the method was shown over the King Fire.
