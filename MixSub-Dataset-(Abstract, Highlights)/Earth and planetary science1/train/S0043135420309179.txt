 A pilot scale upgraded gravity driven submerged membrane reactor was constructed to enhance nitrogen removal . It was artificially formed multiple stratified environments and substrate supply TOC TN COD NH

@highlight A novel system was designed to improve the efficiency of contaminant removals.
@highlight Multiple stratified environments were artificially formed in a single system.
@highlight The microbial communities were tailored to control nitrogen transformation path.
@highlight Complementary of functional genes supported stability of nitrogen transformations.
