 This paper presents the cyclic behavior of double skin composite walls for mid to high rise buildings which consist of concrete filled steel tubes a pair of steel faceplates connected by tie bolts and infill concrete . Four 1 3 scale DSC wall specimens varying in faceplate profile and tie bolt spacing were tested under combined axial and cyclic lateral loading . All specimens failed in flexure with a progression of steel tube fracture steel faceplate buckling and concrete crushing at wall bottom . The corrugated DSC walls and the flat DSC wall with standard bolt spacing were able to achieve an ultimate drift ratio around 3.4 and a ductility ratio greater than 5.4 while the flat DSC wall with bolt spacing 50 over code limit presented early faceplate buckling and undesired seismic performance . Compared to flat DSC walls corrugated DSC walls even with a doubled tie bolt spacing had considerably higher initial stiffness ductility ratio and energy dissipation . Formulations are proposed for predicting the lateral strength and drift capacity of corrugated DSC walls without elastic local buckling . The difference between the predicted and measured capacity for either lateral strength or drift is on average less than 6 .

@highlight Cyclic behavior of the double skin composite DSC walls is examined.
@highlight Corrugated plates are used as faceplates of the DSC walls.
@highlight Corrugated plates delayed faceplate buckling and improved seismic performance.
@highlight Moment and shear distribution in DSC walls are examined.
@highlight Formulations for predicting the flexural strength of the DSC walls are developed.
