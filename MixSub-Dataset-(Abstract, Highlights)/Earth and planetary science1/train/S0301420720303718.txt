 This paper explores the relationship between macro factors and the realized volatility of commodity futures . Three main commoditiessoybeans gold and crude oilare investigated using high frequency data . For macro factors we select six indicators including economic policy uncertainty the economic surprise index default spread the investor sentiment index the volatility index and the geopolitical risk index . These indicators represent three dimensions from macroeconomics and capital markets to a broader geopolitical dimension . Through establishing a dynamic connectedness network we show how these macro factors contribute to the volatility fluctuations in commodity markets . The results demonstrate clearly distinctive features in the reaction to macro shocks across different commodities . Crude oil and gold for example are more reactive to market sentiment whereas DEF contributes the most to the realized volatility of soybeans . Macroeconomic factors and geopolitical risks are more relevant to crude oil volatilities compare to the other two . Our empirical results also reveal the fact that the macro influence on the realized volatility of commodities is time varying .

@highlight A dynamic connectedness network is built to link the macro factors and commodity volatility.

@highlight DEF contributes the most to the realized volatility of soybeans among macro factors.
@highlight Macro factors are more relevant to crude oil volatilities than that of gold and soybeans.
