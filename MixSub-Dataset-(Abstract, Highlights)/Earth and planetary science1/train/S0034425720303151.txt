 Shadows are prevalent in urban environments introducing high uncertainties to fine scale urban land cover mapping . In this study we developed a Recurrent Shadow Attention Model capitalizing on state of the art deep learning architectures to retrieve fine scale land cover classes within cast and self shadows along the urban rural gradient . The RSAM differs from the other existing shadow removal models by progressively refining the shadow detection result with two attention based interacting modules Shadow Detection Module and Shadow Classification Module . To facilitate model training and validation we also created a Shadow Semantic Annotation Database using the 1m resolution NAIP aerial imagery . The SSAD comprises 103 image patches containing various types of shadows and six major land cover classes building tree grass shrub road water and farmland . Our results show an overall accuracy of 90.6 and Kappa of 0.82 for RSAM to extract the six land cover classes within shadows . The model performance was stable along the urban rural gradient although it was slightly better in rural areas than in urban centers or suburban neighborhoods . Findings suggest that RSAM is a robust solution to eliminate the effects in high resolution mapping both from cast and self shadows that have not received equal attention in previous studies .
