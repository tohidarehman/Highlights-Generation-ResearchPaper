 Cooling circuits in many industrial sectors are faced with daily issues of scaling . One preventive treatment consists in injecting a polymer additive in the circuit to inhibit precipitation of calcium carbonate . Among the used additives very few are green and the efficiency of new candidates are difficult to test directly in industrial conditions . The present study compared performance between two green polymer additives polyaspartic acid and polyepoxysuccinic acid versus a traditional gold standard homopolymer of acrylic acid in a laboratory scale set up designed to be representative of an industrial circuit . Results showed that HA and PASP are both inhibitors of calcium carbonate crystal growth . This inhibition resulted from adsorption of polymer additive molecules on the crystal surface as confirmed by adsorption measurement . Under the same conditions PESA additive showed a high rate of calcium ion complexation and a very low inhibition rate . But PESA was shown to be a nucleation delayer . Mixing PESA and PASP can gave nucleation retardation of about 19 h which approximates the 24 h water residence time in industrial cooling circuits as well as almost 90 calcium carbonate crystal growth inhibition . This synergy offers promising prospects for preventive scaling treatment .
