 This study investigates the effect of physicochemical conditions on the partial nitritation and anammox treatment by immobilized ammonia oxidizers under ammonium deplete conditions . The impact of oxygen and temperature was studied by measuring the activity of immobilized aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing organisms and archaea and Anammox bacteria embedded in polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate beads and in thin layer poly ethylene glycol hydrogels . Beads and flat hydrogels were incubated in a fluidized bed reactor and in two flow cells respectively . Both systems were fed with synthetic wastewater 15mgNNH

@highlight AOA AOB Anammox were immobilized in hydrogels.
@highlight Hydrogel beads removed 80 of the ammonium at 0.1mg O
@highlight  L and 30C.
@highlight Thin gel grown in flow cells showed a maximum removal 80 at 1mg O
@highlight  L and 30C.
@highlight Effect of dissolved oxygen and temperature was tested in ammonium depleted wastewater.
@highlight Blueprint drawings are provided for flow cell systems.
