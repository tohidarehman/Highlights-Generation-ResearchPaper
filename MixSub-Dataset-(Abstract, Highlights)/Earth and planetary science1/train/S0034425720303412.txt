 We provide major updates to the top down Fire Radiative Energy Emissions approach to biomass burning emissions calculations bypassing the estimation of fuel consumption that is a major source of uncertainty in widely used bottom up approaches . The FREM approach links satellite observations of fire radiative power to emission rates of total particulate matter via spatially varying smoke emissions coefficients g.MJ

@highlight New top down smoke emission coefficients using high resolution MAIAC AOD.
@highlight Improved biome stratification using CCI Landcover and 30m Landsat Tree Cover data.
@highlight Presents a 6 year fire inventory of TPM CO
@highlight  CO and CH
@highlight emissions for Africa.
@highlight Highest spatio temporal resolution emissions estimates yet available over Africa.
@highlight We find similar emissions to FEER but much higher emissions than GFED and GFAS.
