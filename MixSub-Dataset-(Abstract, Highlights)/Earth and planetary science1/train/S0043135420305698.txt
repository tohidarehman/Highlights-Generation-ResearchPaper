 Tannic acid type organic composite adsorbents combined with hydrolyzed and sulfonated tannic acid and porous type strongly basic anion exchange resin benzimidazole type anion exchange resin embedded in high porous silica beads pyridine type anion exchange resin acrylic type weakly basic anion exchange resin or styrene type weakly basic anion exchange resins for simultaneous removal of various kinds of radionuclides in river water were successfully synthesized . The adsorption behavior of twelve kinds of simulated radionuclides Mn Co Sr Y Ru Rh Sb Te Cs Ba Eu and I I

@highlight Novel six composite adsorbents were developed to be combined with active carbon.
@highlight One of the adsorbents has higher adsorption ability for 12 kinds of radionuclides.
@highlight Ozone can transform Mn Co Y Ru Rh Te and Eu ions into insoluble precipitants.
@highlight Unique adsorption mechanisms were suggested.
@highlight The largest maximum adsorption capacity for I I
@highlight and IO
@highlight  was obtained.
