 In recent years innovative structural systems based on Precast Ferrocement Walls have been proposed for one and two storey housing so as to lessen the housing deficiency . This article presents the results drawn from cycling loading tests carried out over two types of PFWs in order to determine their strength hysteretic behavior ductility energy dissipation capacity equivalent viscous damping and damage limit states . These walls have similar structural systems that differ only in the type of reinforcement . To assess their seismic performances for two earthquake hazard levels a nonlinear dynamic analysis methodology based on the Performance Based Seismic Design philosophy was developed which uses the Mostaghels multilinear hysteretic model to simulate accurately the actual inelastic behavior and energy dissipation capacity of the PFWs together with the incremental dynamic analysis technique . The Immediate Occupancy Life Safety and Collapse Prevention structural performance levels were considered and related to the damage limit states . Finally the performance points of both PFWs fell within the IO range with a 100 probability of incurring no structural damage state for both earthquake hazard levels which demonstrates their good seismic performance .
