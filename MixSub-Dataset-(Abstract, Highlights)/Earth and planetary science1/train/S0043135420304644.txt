 Reuse of sludge derived Fe rich biochar as sludge conditioner is an attractive route for management of waste activated sludge at source . Homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton reactions have been proved in sludge conditioning with Fe rich biochar activating H

@highlight Phase transformations of Fe and Al species in sludge during pyrolysis were studied.
@highlight FeAl
@highlight in biochar contributed to heterogeneous Fenton during sludge conditioning.
@highlight The model of H
@highlight decomposition on surface of FeAl
@highlight was proposed by VASP.
@highlight Synergistic effect of Fe and Al of FeAl
@highlight enhanced the adsorption energy of H
@highlight Heterogeneous Fenton reaction contributed to destroy inner part of sludge flocs.
