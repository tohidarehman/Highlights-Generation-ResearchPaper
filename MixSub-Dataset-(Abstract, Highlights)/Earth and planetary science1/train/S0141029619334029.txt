 The use of controlled ductile rocking shear walls with low damage connections can be an efficient alternative to traditional high damage design in order to mitigate the earthquake induced damage . Nowadays there is an increased demand for seismic low damage systems that can offer a high resistance level against the severe seismic events allowing the buildings to be swiftly returned to service . This paper introduces a friction based energy dissipation hold down connection for rocking Cross Laminated Timber structures with potential for re centring behaviour . The results of component experimental tests on the device and results of large scale tests on a rocking CLT wall with the proposed hold down connectors have shown that the proposed system has the potential to be used in earthquake resistant low to mid rise CLT structures . Furthermore capacity prediction equations are provided for this system that are verified by comparing the analytical data with the experimental results .

@highlight A new friction damper with self centering characteristic is introduced.
@highlight Results of the joint component tests confirmed the expected performance.
@highlight A new concept for rocking Cross Laminated Timber CLT walls is introduced.
@highlight A new shear key for rocking timber walls is presented.
@highlight The results of full scale test demonstrated a good seismic performance and self centering capability.
