 Membrane fouling is posing a critical obstacle limiting the widespread application of ultrafiltration . Among the numerous membrane foulants natural organic matter is one of the most problematic since it exists ubiquitously in natural waters and can cause severe membrane fouling . This study investigated the removal of NOM in surface water and the mitigation of membrane fouling using heat activated peroxydisulfate as a pretreatment for UF process . The results demonstrated that the NOM was efficiently removed with ultraviolet absorbance UV

@highlight The heat activated peroxydisulfate was adopted as a pretreatment prior to ultrafiltration.
@highlight Suitable temperatures for mitigating membrane fouling by pre oxidation were above 50C.
@highlight Structural destruction and mineralization of natural organic matter occurred simultaneously in oxidation process.
@highlight The destroyed structure of humic substances might hinder its binding with high valence cations.
