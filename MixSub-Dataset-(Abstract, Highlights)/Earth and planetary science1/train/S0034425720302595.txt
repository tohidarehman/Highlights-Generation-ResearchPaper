 Assessing the oceanic surface layer s optical properties through CALIOP has been one of the reasons of the extension of the CALIOP mission for 3 more years . This is the first work evaluating the potential use of CALIOP for ocean applications at regional scale in mid latitude regions and investigating the added information on ocean particles given by the column integrated depolarization ratio

@highlight The potential use of CALIOP for ocean applications at basin scale was evaluated.
