 This paper describes a numerical parametric investigation for the effects of coarse recycled concrete aggregates on the time dependent vertical deflections of reinforced concrete columns under sustained service loads . The deflections were analyzed for interior and exterior column loading conditions with different volumetric replacement of the coarse aggregate

@highlight Recycled concrete aggregates RCA cause increased column deflections.
@highlight Initial column deflections increase more than time dependent deflections.
@highlight Deflections increase more for stronger concrete bigger sections smaller steel ratios.
@highlight Deflections increase less for exterior columns with flexural cracking.
@highlight Deflections increase less when using quality RCA.
