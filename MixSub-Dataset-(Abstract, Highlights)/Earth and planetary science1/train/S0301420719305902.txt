 Energy rich areas often rely on energy resources for economic growth but ignore structural transformation for sustainable development . Over recent years the coal market has been depressed leading to a decrease in economic growth along with a difficult structural transition in the contiguous area of Shanxi and Shaanxi Provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region which is one of the most important national energy bases in China . To examine whether industrial structure has suffered from coal resource curse and find feasible transformation paths a panel data model is constructed to analyze coal resource and industrial structure nexus in this contiguous area . The results show that there is a significant U shape or inverted U shape relationship between coal resource and industrial structure . Excessive exploitation of coal resource impedes the transformation of industrial structure to a more advanced level and could even deteriorate the rational allocation of resources among industries in energy rich areas . Dutch disease and crowding out capital and technology caused by coal exploitation are the primary channels aggravating the dilemma of industrial structure transformation . Our findings highlight the significance of coordinating energy resource exploitation and industrial structure evolution in energy rich areas .

@highlight A significant U shape or inverted relationship between coal resource and industrial structure occurs in energy rich area.
@highlight Excessive coal exploitation tends to cause the resource curse hampering industrial structural transformation.
@highlight The Dutch disease and crowding out effects aggravate the dilemma of industrial structure transformation.
@highlight The significance of coordinating resource exploitation and industrial evolution in energy rich areas is emphasized.
