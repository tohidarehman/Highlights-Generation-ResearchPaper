 The mangrove forests of northeast Hainan Island are the most species diverse forests in China and consist of the Dongzhai National Nature Reserve and the Qinglan Provincial Nature Reserve . The former reserve is the first Chinese national nature reserve for mangroves and the latter has the most abundant mangrove species in China . However to date the aboveground ground biomass of this mangrove region has not been quantified due to the high species diversity and the difficulty of extensive field sampling in mangrove habitat . Although three dimensional point clouds can capture the forest vertical structure their application to large areas is hindered by the logistics costs and data volumes involved . To fill the gap and address this issue this study proposed a novel upscaling method for mangrove AGB estimation using field plots UAV LiDAR strip data and Sentinel 2 imagery based on a point line polygon framework . In this model the partial coverage UAV LiDAR data were used as a linear bridge to link ground measurements to the wall to wall coverage Sentinel 2 data . The results showed that northeast Hainan Island has a total mangrove AGB of 312 806.29Mg with a mean AGB of 119.26Mg ha

@highlight The first estimation of aboveground biomass AGB of the most species diverse mangrove forest in China.
@highlight Propose a novel mangrove AGB upscaling method by integrating field plots UAV LiDAR strip data and Sentinel 2 imagery.
@highlight The proposed GLiDARS2 model performed better than the traditional approach namely the GS2 model.
@highlight The GLiDARS2 model can significantly reduce field sampling work by approximately 39 in the study area.
@highlight The derived mangrove AGB map can serve as a baseline for future mangrove studies in this region.
