 Environment friendly and cost effective disposal and reutilization of sludge wastes are essential in wastewater treatment processes . Converting activated sludge into biochar via thermochemical treatment is a promising technology for waste management in WWTPs . This review summarizes the compositions of sludge the dewatering methods and the thermochemical methods whichinfluence the structures chemistry and catalytic performances of the derived biochar . Moreover the physiochemical characteristics and chemical stability of sludge biochar are discussed . Catalytic applications of biochar are highlighted including the reaction mechanisms and feasibility for catalytic removal of organic contaminants . High temperature carbonized sludge biochar exhibits excellent performance for persulfate activation in advanced oxidation processes due to the graphitic carbon structure newly created active sites and fine tuned metal species . Therefore the sludge biochar can be produced via cost effective and eco friendly approaches to immobilize harmful components from sludge and remediate organic pollution in wastewater offering a sustainable route toward sludge reutilization into value added products for water purification .
