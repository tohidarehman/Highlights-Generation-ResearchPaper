 We introduced a simplified method to measure the buckling severity of the cylindrical structures subjected to axial compression . The method is intended for the cylindrical structures with a buckling mode comprising a repetition of similar single tiers and estimates an upper bound of the deformed surface shape of the structure from measurements of a few data points . Moreover this method helps monitor the magnitude of surface distortion of the large sized buckled cylindrical structures with full field surface shapes that are usually problematic for measurement . The discussion of classical buckling theory reveals that the point to point variation of radial displacements on cylindrical structures with periodic buckling pattern is similarly distributed even when the buckling mode changes depending on the structures size . A fundamental probability distribution model governing the point to point variation of the radial displacements is established from the results . A computation procedure for the conservative upper bound of radial displacements from measurements at a few data points is proposed . A buckling experiment on cylindrical structures under axial compression demonstrated that the CUB from the proposed method appropriately envelopes the radial displacement of the buckled cylindrical structure within a designated probability confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method . The study offers a novel method to compute the magnitude of the surface distortion of buckled cylindrical structures from a few measurements .
