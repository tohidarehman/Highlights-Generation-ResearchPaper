 This study develops an innovative wind tunnel testing methodology for assessing the hygro mechanical response of brick masonry to wind driven rain . The results highlight that such response depends largely on material properties rain load characteristics saturation level and wetting history . Additionally rain penetration even during milder rainfall events induces the degradation in mechanical properties stress redistribution and curtailing of damage and failure stress thresholds in bricks . Finally synergies with additional adverse conditions such as temperature and salts produce a combined damaging action that can undermine the structural integrity of building elements . Within the research framework future work is also proposed .
