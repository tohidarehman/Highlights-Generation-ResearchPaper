 Over the past decade sequential laser scanning has become increasingly routine for geomorphic monitoring in steep mountainous environments . Laser scans represent a permanent record of the terrain topology at a given point in time . Comparison of multitemporal datasets facilitates the identification of changes occurring in the terrain over time . Vegetation points in laser scans can inhibit the alignment of sequential scans .

@highlight Raster based tree extraction is hindered when applied in mountainous terrain
@highlight Multi scale geometric operators are used to classify vegetation in 3D point clouds
@highlight Voxel based region growing is used to delineate individual trees
@highlight Delineated trees are directly incorporated into rockfall runout modelling
@highlight Overclassification of trees overestimates the protective capacity of the forest
