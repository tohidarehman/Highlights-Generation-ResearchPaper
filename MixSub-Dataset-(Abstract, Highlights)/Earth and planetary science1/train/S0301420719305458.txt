Despite providing a sizable amount of fiscal revenue the volatility of natural resource revenue requires countries to rely on non resource domestic revenue sources . In this paper I revisit the question of how revenue from natural resources affects non resource tax revenue and its components . I test the hypothesis that increased resource revenue is offset by a decrease in domestic non resource tax revenue by exploiting an exogenous variation arising from giant oil and gas discoveries . I do not find evidence supporting the hypothesis of substitution between resource and non resource revenues . Rather I find that giant oil discoveries lead to

@highlight Empirical analysis of the effect of natural resources on domestic tax revenue.
