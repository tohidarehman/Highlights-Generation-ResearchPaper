 Time series remote sensing data are important in monitoring land surface dynamics . Due to technical limitations satellite sensors have a trade off between temporal spatial and spectral resolutions when acquiring remote sensing images . In order to obtain remote sensing images with high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency spatiotemporal fusion methods have been developed . In this paper we propose a Linear Spectral Unmixing based Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Model for spatial and temporal data fusion . In this model the endmember abundance of the low resolution image pixel is calculated based on that of the high resolution image by the spectral mixture analysis . The endmember spectrum signals of low resolution images are then calculated continuously within an optimized moving window . Subsequently the fused image is reconstructed according to the endmember spectrum and its corresponding abundance map . A simulated dataset and real satellite images are used to test the fusion model and the fusion results are compared with a current spectral unmixing based downscaling fusion model . Our experimental work shows that compared to the SUDFM the proposed LSUSDFM can achieve better quality and accuracy of fused images especially in effectively eliminating the plaque phenomenon in the results by the SUDFM . The LSUSDFM has great potential in generating images with both high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency as well as increasing the number of spectral bands of the high spatial resolution data .
