 For the control of sulfide and methane in sewers it is favorable to reduce their production rather than to remove them after generation . In this study we revealed rapid and strong biocidal effect of ferrate on sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms leading to control of sulfide and methane production in sewer . The inactivation of the microorganisms in sewer biofilms by Fe could be accomplished within 15min for a single dosing event and the biocidal effect could be enhanced by applying pulse dosing strategy . The microbiological analysis showed that the key functional genes involved in sulfide and methane production i.e .

@highlight Fe VI could pose a rapid biocidal effect on the sewer biofilm.
@highlight The biocidal effect of Fe VI could be enhanced by pulse dosing.
@highlight The relative abundances of viable SRB and MA dropped with Fe VI dosing.
@highlight Fe VI led to complete suppression of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities.
@highlight Fe VI dosing strategy is cost effective for sulfide and methane control in sewers.
