 Biofilm activities and their interactions with physical chemical and biological processes are of great importance for a variety of ecosystem functions impacting hydrogeomorphology water quality and aquatic ecosystem health . Effective management of water bodies requires advancing our understanding of how flow influences biofilm bound sediment and ecosystem processes and vice versa . However research on this triangle of flow biofilm sediment is still at its infancy . In this Review we summarize the current state of the art and methodological approaches in the flow biofilm sediment research with an emphasis on biostabilization and fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone of lotic and lentic environments . Example studies of this three way interaction across a range of spatial scales from cell to patch scale are highlighted in view of the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches . As a contribution to the review we combine a literature survey with results of a pilot experiment that was conducted in the framework of a joint workshop to explore the feasibility of asking interdisciplinary questions . Further within this workshop various observation and measuring approaches were tested and the quality of the achieved results was evaluated individually and in combination . Accordingly the paper concludes by highlighting the following research challenges to be considered within the forthcoming years in the triangle of flow biofilm sediment

@highlight Flow biofilm sediment interactions in relation to biostabilization are reviewed.
@highlight This is supported by a joint workshop testing feasibility of an integrated approach.
@highlight Development in optical tools and molecular approaches increased biofilm understanding.
@highlight Mechanical understanding of biostabilization have not been well understood.
@highlight Challenges include realism scalability and methodological limitations.
