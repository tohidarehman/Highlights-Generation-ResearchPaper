 Reclaiming abundant phosphorus from sewage sludge via pyrolysis for use as a fertilizer has gained increasing attention owing to the rapid depletion of global P reserves . In this study the enhancement effect of Ca based additives on sludge P transformation to hydroxylapatite through pyrolysis was systematically investigated . Three Ca based additives were added in the pyrolysis of SS and they were found to promote the conversion of sludge P to hydroxylapatite which is bioavailable to plants . The characterization of the sludge derived pyrochars indicated that the addition of 10 CaO 5 Ca

@highlight Ca based additives enhanced the conversion of P to hydroxylapatite.
@highlight Optimal fraction of hydroxylapatite 37.53 was achieved at the addition of 10 CaO.
@highlight The hydroxylapatite content decrease sharply over 900C.
@highlight Sludge derived pyrochars are an effective P based fertilizer.
@highlight An effective strategy for the recovery of P in sewage sludge is proposed.
