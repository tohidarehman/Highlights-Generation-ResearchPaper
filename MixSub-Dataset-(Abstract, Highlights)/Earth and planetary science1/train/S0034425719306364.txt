 The cloud top height product derived from passive satellite instrument measurements is often used to make climate data records . CALIPSO provides CTH parameters with high accuracy but with limited temporal spatial resolution . Recently the Advanced Himawari Imager onboard Japanese Himawari 8 9 provides high temporal and high spatial resolution measurements with 16 spectral bands . This paper reports on a study to derive the CTH from combined AHI and CALIPSO using advanced machine learning algorithms with better accuracy than that from the traditional physical algorithms . We find significant CTH improvements from four different machine learning algorithms particularly in high and optically thin clouds . In addition we also develop a joint algorithm to combine optimal machine learning and traditional physical algorithms of CTH to further reduce MAE to 1.53km and enhance the layered accuracy . While the ML based algorithm improves CTH retrieval over the TRA algorithm the lower or higher clouds still exhibit relatively large uncertainty . Combining both methods provides the better CTH than either alone . The combined approach could be used to process data from advanced geostationary imagers for climate and weather applications .
