 Estimating the proportions of particulate organic carbon endmembers is essential to fully understand the carbon cycle the function of aquatic ecosystems and the migration of contaminants in eutrophic lakes . There is currently no effective remote sensing optical algorithm in the literature to solve this problem . In this study a POC source color index

@highlight Combination of isotope and remote sensing can trace dynamics of POC sources.
@highlight Surface water of Lake Taihu was dominated by terrestrial POC.
@highlight Ratio of endogenous POC was physiologically related to algae and aquatic vegetation.
@highlight Particulate matter absorption were effective indicators of POC sources.
