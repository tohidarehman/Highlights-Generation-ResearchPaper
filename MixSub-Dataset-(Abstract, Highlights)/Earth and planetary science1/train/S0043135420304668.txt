 The principle of subsurface arsenic removal from groundwater is based on oxidation and adsorption reactions by infiltrating oxygen into the anoxic aquifer and the immobilization of arsenic onto freshly formed iron oxides . In this study a pilot scale plant for SAR has been subject to long term testing in the Mekong Delta Vietnam . Initial concentrations of Fe 8.41.3mgL

@highlight A pilot plant for subsurface arsenic removal SAR was operated for over 2 years.
@highlight Arsenic was successfully lowered to below WHO drinking water guideline.
@highlight No remobilization of As was observed for 28 months operation.
@highlight SAR is a low cost sustainable method with no toxic waste produced.
