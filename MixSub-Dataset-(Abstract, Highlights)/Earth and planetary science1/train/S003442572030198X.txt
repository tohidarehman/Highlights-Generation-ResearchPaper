 Generalized assessments of the accuracy of spectroscopic estimates of ecologically important leaf traits such as leaf mass per area and leaf dry matter content are still lacking for most ecosystems and particularly for non forested and or seasonally dry tropical vegetation . Here we tested the ability of using leaf reflectance spectra to estimate LMA and LDMC and classify plant growth forms within the

@highlight We measured spectra and leaf traits for an understudied dry tropical grassland 
@highlight We could not accurately predict LMA values 300g m
@highlight from spectral data
@highlight We could infer plant lifeform from spectra despite absence of leaf trait differences
@highlight These key findings have seldom been studied due to biases towards humid forests
