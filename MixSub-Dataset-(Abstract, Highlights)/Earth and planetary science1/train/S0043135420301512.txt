 Iopamidol is a potential source of toxic iodinated byproducts during water disinfection . In this work we determined the kinetics and mechanism of degradation of IPM by a combination of ozone O

@highlight Combination of O
@highlight and PMS accelerated IPM degradation.
@highlight HO.
@highlight and SO
@highlight were the dominated reactive oxygen species.
@highlight Second order reaction rate between SO
@highlight and IPM was determined to be 1.610
@highlight  PMS oxidation decreased the I THM formation potential from IPM.
