 Increasing attention has been focused on the removal of micropollutants from contaminated drinking source water . However low rejection efficiency and membrane fouling still inhibit further application of nanofiltration membrane in this field . Interesting results were found that the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles from supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation strongly improved the nanofiltration performance for micropollutant removal . A simulated raw water containing humic acids micropollutants and kaolinite clay was employed to investigate the factors of water matrix affecting the nanoparticle enhanced nanofiltration for micropollutant removal . Results of experiments showed that these hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles easily induced the aggregation of bisphenol A and humic acids in the supernatant . The enhancement of BPA removal was mainly attributed to the repelling interaction between the Al BPA DOC complexity and

@highlight Micropollutant removal by nanofiltration was enhanced by hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles.
@highlight Loosely hydrophilic deposition on membrane surface alleviated membrane fouling.
@highlight Aluminum deposited membrane achieved excellent performance in background of river water.
