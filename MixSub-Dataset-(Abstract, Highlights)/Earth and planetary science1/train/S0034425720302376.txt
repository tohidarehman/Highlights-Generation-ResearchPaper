 Knowledge of the status of flying aircraft is vital for efficient and safe air space management . However this requirement is often compromised due to the complexity of the aviation environment . Satellite remote sensing provides a complementary means for tracing aircraft but is often limited to finding motionless aircraft under specific scenarios . Here based on the inter band offsets due to hardware parallax in push broom sensors we develop a method for detecting flying aircraft in an automated fashion . Supported by a hybrid computation framework specifically designed to address the challenge of processing large volume of moderate resolution RS data at a global scale the method is applied to more than 2.31 million MSI images to establish a map of the global distribution of flying aircraft . The detected flying aircraft coincide well with those determined using traditional techniques when both datasets co exist . With the existing and future moderate resolution data captured by push broom satellite sensors the method is believed to provide a robust and cost effective means of detecting aircraft status at a global scale thus supplementing the traditional methods for tracking flying aircraft . The same method is also used to estimate the inter band and inter granule time offsets in multi band MSI and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager images which may provide critical information needed to correct artifacts in aquatic applications .
