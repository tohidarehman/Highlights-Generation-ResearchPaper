 Suspended biofilm carriers mediating direct interspecies electron transfer based syntrophic metabolism is a promising strategy to enhance anaerobic digestion and methane production by associating the advantages of conductive suspended biofilm carriers and anaerobic integrated floating fixed film and activated sludge process . However the current knowledge of DIET using conductive suspended biofilm carrier is still limited . In this study novel electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers had been prepared by introducing a series of graphite powders into high density polyethylene and applied in An IFFAS reactors . Results showed that An IFFAS reactors filled with graphite modified carriers could enhance the degradation of organic matters and the production of methane significantly in comparison with the control reactor filled with conventional HDPE carriers at organic loading rates of 5.923.7 kg COD m

@highlight Electron mediator carrier had the capability of AD enhancing.
@highlight Electron mediator carrier filled reactors gained higher methane productivity.
