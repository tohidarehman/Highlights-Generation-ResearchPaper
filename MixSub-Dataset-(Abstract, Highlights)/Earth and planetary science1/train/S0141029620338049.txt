 A ramp bridge in Hangzhou of Zhejiang Province in China collapsed on April 14 2017 . This paper presented a forensic analysis of the collapse that combines bridge metadata witness accounts video footages that captured the event and numerical simulations . The forensic case study showed that the replacement of the originally symmetric section of the curved ramp bridges box girder with an asymmetric one together with the introduction of a sidewalk on its outer side led to excessive forces on the lateral supports . Construction deviations from the intended configurations of the padstones further exacerbated the situation . A relatively minor nearby earthquake then caused the already precarious superstructure to slip westwards by approximately 10cm and induced highly localized compression damage to the padstones . A sliding surface was thus formed through successive crushing of several padstones which led to the collapse of the bridge . The present case study shows that a proper fusion of pre and post event data can shed light on the overturning collapse mechanisms of box girder bridges and illuminates potential hazards in existing bridges with similar geometries .

@highlight This bridge collapse analysis exploited evidence contained in wreckage photos.
@highlight Visual analysis revealed the collapse rooting from design modification.
@highlight Design modification resulted in severe compression of the western pedestals.
@highlight Small earthquake then caused transverse movement and thereby collapse of the bridge.
