 A large experimental and numerical program based on fire tests of timber connections under various mechanical loadings was performed in France since 1999 . Numerical models simulating the thermomechanical behavior of these tested connections were developed and validated on the basis of experimental results . The developed model is sufficiently relevant to realize parametrical studies on timber connections . Then considering the four main parameters influencing the fire resistance of the connections the model is used to analyze the combined influence of these factors and to realize a calibration based on the experimental design approach . The commonly used thicknesses of timber elements and diameters of fastener are chosen in the study . The experimental design approach based on numerical results considers the main loading cases in timber connections . It is used to propose a simplified formula to predict the fire resistance of timber connections loaded in tension parallel to grain perpendicular to grain or bending . The proposed formula is then applied to all the available experimental results to check its accuracy .
