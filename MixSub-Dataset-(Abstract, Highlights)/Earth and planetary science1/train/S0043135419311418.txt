 Solar driven evaporation has been proposed as an efficient way to harvest solar energy for water treatment and desalination . However the complex preparation process and the degradation of photothermal absorbers restrict their practical applications in solar thermal technology . Herein a solar assisted fabrication of three dimensional dimpled MoS

@highlight Solar assisted three dimensional dimpled MoS
