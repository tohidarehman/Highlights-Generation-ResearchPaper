 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused more than 200 000 reported COVID 19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20 800 deaths as of April 21 2020 . Faecal shedding of SARS CoV 2 RNA from COVID 19 patients has extensively been reported . Therefore we investigated the occurrence of SARS CoV 2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia the area with the lowest COVID 19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula . Firstly an aluminum hydroxide adsorption precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus and mengovirus . The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 103.5 and 102.1 in influent water and 3.31.6 and 6.21.0 in effluent water samples for PEDV and MgV respectively . Then the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS CoV 2 from March 12 to April 14 2020 in influent secondary and tertiary effluent water samples . By using the real time RT PCR Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid gene we estimated quantification of SARS CoV 2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.40.2 log

@highlight An adsorption precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus.
@highlight First detection of SARS CoV 2 RNA in untreated wastewater in Spain.
@highlight 11 secondary treated water samples tested positive for at least one SARS CoV 2 RT qPCR target.
@highlight None of the tertiary effluent samples n 12 tested positive for SARS CoV 2.
@highlight SARS CoV 2 RNA was detected in wastewater before the first COVID 19 cases were declared by local authorities.
