 Atmospheric water vapor plays a key role in the global water and energy cycles . Accurate estimation of water vapor and consistent representation of its spatial temporal variation are critical to climate analysis and model validation . This study used ground observational data from global radiosonde and sunphotometer networks to evaluate MODIS precipitable water vapor products for 20002017 . The products included the thermal infrared and its updated version and near infrared products . Our results demonstrated that compared to its earlier version subject to sensor crosstalk problem the C061 TIR data showed improved accuracy in terms of bias standard deviation mean absolute error root mean square error and coefficient of determination regression slope and intercept . Among the PWV products C061 NIR data achieved the best overall performance in accuracy evaluation . The C061 NIR revealed the PWV had a multi year average of 2.500.08cm for the globe 2.030.06cm for continents and 2.700.09cm for oceans in 20002017 . The PWV values yielded an increasing rate of 0.015cm year for the globe 0.010cm year for continents and 0.017cm year for oceans . Nearly 98.95 of the globe showed an increasing trend 80.74 of statistical significance mainly distributed within and around the tropical zones . The findings should be valuable for understanding of global water and energy cycles .

@highlight MODIS near infrared water vapor products had the highest overall accuracy.
@highlight Downward trend is an artifact in previous version of thermal infrared products.
@highlight Water vapor had a multi year average of 2.500.08cm for 20002017.
@highlight Water vapor increased significantly at a rate of 0.015cm year for globe.
@highlight Oceanic regions contributed more than continental to global PWV change.
