 The financial development and economic prosperity is impacted by the abundance of natural resources . There have been many studies that have explored the nexus between economic growth and resource abundance . However none of these have thoroughly assessed this relationship in resource abundant and highly populous South Asia . Our research attempts to analyze this phenomenon by employing data from seven South Asian countries for the period between 1990 and 2017 . We employ investment freedom together with natural resources abundance technological innovation and trade in the financial development demand function . The findings support the presence of the resources curse hypothesis for South Asian countries . Furthermore we observe that the investment freedom is negatively related to financial development . In contrast technological innovation and increasing trade promote financial development . We suggest that South Asian economies should focus on flexible capital flows conducive investment policies optimize natural resource mobilization and must concentrate on technological adaption to foster economic growth .
