 Microplastics can be found all over the world in the remotest regions and even in the Arctic snow . Primary microplastic is either produced as microparticles or enters the natural environment already as microparticles . Whereas secondary microplastic is generated by fragmentation or abrasion of other products in the natural environment . Both pollute the global ecospheres and even enter the human food chain . This study aims at the evaluation of the global publication output on both types of microplastic referring to absolute and contextual numbers . Only since 2006 the focus on the environmental burden led to an enormous increase of publications on MP . While China USA and Germany are leading players regarding the absolute numbers Portugal Chile and Ireland are among the top countries when including socio economic features and research expenditures . The responsibility for the big plastic waste producers can be shown by significantly correlating numbers of articles and the plastic waste generation albeit here China and USA fall behind . However the biggest producers are not the most affected countries . Despite the strong international interest our study shows that many countries play no role at all in the publication landscape of MP . For future planning it is necessary to extend the international collaborations to reach sustainable solutions for the whole planet earth .

@highlight China USA and Germany are leading publishing countries on microplastics.
@highlight Socio economic analyses rank Portugal Chile and Ireland among the top countries.
@highlight Plastic waste generation is correlated with the countries publication output.
@highlight By including contextual factors China and USA falls far behind.
@highlight Education know how and infrastructure should be provided for low economies.
