 Anaerobic ammonium oxidation based technology has potential for nitrogen removal from wastewater with high salinity but both salt and nitrite have negative effect on microbial activity . In order to achieve Anammox in saline wastewater treatment it is essential to understand the combined effect of these two components . In this study the individual and combined effect of salinity and nitrite on fixed film freshwater Anammox bacteria FAB mainly belonging to the

@highlight The individual and combined effect of salinity and nitrite on FAB was systematically studied.
@highlight Anammox activity decreased with increased salinity with the IC
@highlight observed at 14.6mS cm.
@highlight Anammox activity was unaffected by nitrite concentration up to 450mgN L IC
@highlight was 666mgN L.
@highlight Combined inhibitory effect was synergistic at low salt and nitrite concentration.
@highlight Nitrite accumulation under elevated salinity will likely result in synergistic inhibition.
