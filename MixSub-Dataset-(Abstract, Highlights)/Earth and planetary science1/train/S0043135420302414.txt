 Biological treatment of wastewater always leaves plenty of refractory dissolved organic matters in effluents specifically for fresh waste leachate . Aiming at comprehending the production and removal of these compounds this study investigated DOM transformation in a simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis with activated sludge system with

@highlight A DOM classification was proposed to recognize remnant DOM composition in effluent.
@highlight The persistence of classified DOM categories was compared.
@highlight Bio derived DOM accounted for 7684 of effluent DOM as recalcitrant fraction.
@highlight Production and removal of bio derived DOM meet a hyperbolical relationship.
