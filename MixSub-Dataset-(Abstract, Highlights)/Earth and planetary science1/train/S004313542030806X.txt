 An improved understanding of the diversity and composition of microbial communities carrying antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes in aquifers recharged with stormwater is essential to comprehend potential human health risks from water reuse . A high throughput functional gene array was used to study the prevalence of ARGs and VGs in aquifer biofilms taken from three boreholes over three months . Bacterial genera annotated as opportunistic pathogens such as

@highlight Stormwater pathway for entry of pathogenic and opportunistic pathogens into aquifer.
@highlight Bacteria carrying ARGs and VGs embedded in biofilms survive 3 months.
@highlight Multidrug efflux pump SMR and Mex and lactamase C genes highly prevalent.
@highlight VGs encoding siderophores pilin hemolysin and type III secretion ubiquitous.
@highlight  and
