 Biological pump is important to control the fate and distribution of organic contaminants particularly in temperate and cold oligotrophic waters . However it remains largely unknown how factors affect the long term occurrence and fate of ionogenic organic compounds in subtropical eutrophic waters . The present study aimed to assess biogeochemical and physical factors affecting the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of 14 antibiotics through planktonic food webs in the Pearl River a large subtropical eutrophic river in China . This was done by carrying out 1 year simultaneous field observations of antibiotic concentrations in five water column compartments and assessing the variability of bioconcentration bioaccumulation and biomagnification factors which were influenced by plankton biomass pH and temperature of water columns . The annual mean antibiotic concentration per site ranged from 1014.66535.66ngL

@highlight Annual distribution and fate of 14 antibiotics was studied in a subtropical river.
@highlight Antibiotics in water columns increased with algal biomass and total phosphorus.
@highlight Bioaccumulation were dominated by the biomass dilution and biological pump.
@highlight The relationships between bioaccumulation factor and temperature were biphasic.
@highlight Biomagnification was positively correlated to algal biomass and temperature.
