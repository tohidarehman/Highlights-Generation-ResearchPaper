 Urban marine estuaries are often impacted by microbiological contamination that impairs use and affects human health acutely while limited is known about microbiological water quality in urban marine estuaries in the absence of reported sewage spills . This study used a tropical urban marine estuary the Ala Wai Canal in Honolulu Hawaii as the model system to compare fecal indicator bacteria concentrations bacterial pathogen profiles and microbial community structures . The FIB

@highlight FIB inconsistently predict fecal contamination in the urban estuary.
@highlight Direct pathogen detection showed ubiquitous presence of
@highlight Microbial community analysis corroborates direct pathogen detection.
@highlight FIB showed no significant correlation with pathogen profiles.
@highlight Direct pathogen detection for comprehensive microbial risks assessment is needed.
