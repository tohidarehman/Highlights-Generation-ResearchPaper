 Sulfamethoxazole is a common antibiotic prescribed for treating infections which is frequently detected in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants . Its degradation and conversion in a laboratory scale sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactor were for the first time investigated through long term reactor operation and short term batch experiments . Co metabolism of SMX and nitrate by autotrophic denitrifiers was observed in this study . The specific SMX removal rate was 3.71.4g g SS d which was higher than those reported in conventional wastewater treatment processes . The removal of SMX by the enriched denitrifying sludge was mainly attributed to biodegradation . Four transformation products were identified of which the structures of the two transformation products were altered in the isoxazole ring . Additionally the presence of SMX significantly shaped the microbial community structures leading to the dominant denitrifier shifting from
