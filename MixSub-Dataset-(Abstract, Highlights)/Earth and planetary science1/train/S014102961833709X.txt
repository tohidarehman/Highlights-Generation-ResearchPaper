 Recent earthquakes such as Loma Prieta and Northridge in California have highlighted the poor performance of a specific class of existing buildings known as soft story building . This is because many older buildings were designed prior to the implementation of modern seismic design codes . Although building codes have clearly evolved the problem is still unresolved for older buildings that are code deficient such as soft story wood frame buildings . Retrofitting these types of buildings came to the forefront after the 1989 Loma Prieta 1992 Cape Mendocino and 1994 Northridge earthquakes . This paper presents a new performance based seismic retrofit methodology for existing wood frame buildings with an extreme soft story and torsional irregularity at their first story i.e . the most common case for these types of buildings in the San Francisco Bay Area . The method was validated numerically using non linear time history analysis and then was validated experimentally by conducting full scale shake table tests on a four story wood frame building at NHERI @ UC San Diego the largest outdoor shake table in the United States . The method is shown to be applicable to these types of buildings and some advantages of the PBSR method over soft story only retrofit methodologies are presented .

@highlight Practical procedures for retrofitting existing wood frame buildings are discussed.
@highlight Development and application of PBSR method in retrofitting buildings is explained.
@highlight The PBSR method is validated by numerical analysis and experimental test results.
@highlight Results of full scale shake table testing of a four story building are presented.
@highlight Comparison between multi story retrofit and single story retrofit methods is made.
@highlight Practical retrofitting techniques to retrofit wood frame buildings are presented.
