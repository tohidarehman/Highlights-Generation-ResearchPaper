 Over the past decades groundwater quality has deteriorated worldwide by nitrate pollution due to the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture release of untreated urban sewage and industrial wastewater and atmospheric deposition . Likewise groundwater is increasingly polluted by sulfate due to the release of domestic municipal and industrial wastewaters as well as through geothermal processes seawater intrusion atmospheric deposition mineral dissolution and acid rain . The urbanized and industrialized Monterrey valley has a long record of elevated nitrate and sulfate concentrations in groundwater with multiple potential pollution sources . This study aimed to track different sources and transformation processes of nitrate and sulfate pollution in Monterrey using a suite of chemical and isotopic tracers

@highlight Groundwater nitrate and sulfate sources and transformation were investigated.
@highlight Water chemistry stable isotopes and a Bayesian mixing model were combined.
@highlight Soil nitrogen and sewage were the most important nitrate sources.
@highlight Atmospheric deposition marine evaporites and sewage were the main sulfate sources.
@highlight Contamination was controlled by denitrification and sulfate reduction processes.
