 Recognition of human excreta as a resource rather than as waste has led to the emergence of a range of new and innovative nutrient recovery solutions . Nevertheless the management of human excreta remains largely rooted in current sanitation and wastewater management approaches which often makes nutrient recovery an add on to existing infrastructures . In this paper we argue that framing human excreta management as a resource recovery challenge within waste management obscures important trade offs . We explore the factors that would be brought to the fore by reframing human excreta management as part of food and farming systems . We find that such a reframing would accentuate six aspects of critical importance that are currently largely overlooked . Recognizing that the proposed framing may also have its limitations we argue that it has the potential to better guide human excreta management towards long term global food soil and nutrient security while reducing the risk of compromising other priorities related to human and environmental health .
