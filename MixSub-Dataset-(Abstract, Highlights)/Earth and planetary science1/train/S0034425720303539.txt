 Mapping and monitoring landslides in remote areas with steep and mountainous terrain is logistically challenging expensive and time consuming . Yet in order to mitigate hazards and prevent loss of life in these areas and to better understand landslide processes high resolution measurements of landslide activity are necessary . Satellite based synthetic aperture radar interferometry provides millimeter scale measurements of ground surface deformation that can be used to identify and monitor landslides in remote areas where ground based monitoring techniques are not feasible . Here we present a novel InSAR deformation detection approach which uses double difference time series with local and regional spatial filters and pixel clustering methods to identify and monitor slow moving landslides without making a priori assumptions of the location of landslides . We apply our analysis to freely available Copernicus Sentinel 1 satellite data acquired between 2014 and 2017 centered on the Trishuli River drainage basin in Nepal . We found a minimum of 6 slow moving landslides that all occur within the Ranimatta lithologic formation . These landslides have areas ranging from 0.39 to 1.66km

@highlight A novel method is developed to detect landslides in mountainous terrain.
@highlight InSAR time series is used to identify and monitor slow moving landslides.
@highlight 6 slow moving landslides in Trishuli Nepal unaffected by the Gorkha earthquake.
@highlight Landslides have rates between 2 and 9cm yr and likely driven by monsoonal rainfall.
