 This paper studied the bond slip behaviour between a corrugated steel plate with studs and concrete . A total of twelve corrugated steel plate concrete composite specimens were tested for push out among which eleven CSPC specimens had studs and one specimen had no studs . Taking the diameter of the studs length of the studs number of studs spacing of the studs and thickness of the corrugated steel plate as variables the bond performance of the specimens were analysed and the failure modes and cracking types were studied . The results showed that the load slip curve of the CSPC specimens mainly exhibited the ascending phase the descending phase and the residual phase meanwhile only the diameter of the studs the spacing of the studs and the number of studs had an influence on the average bond strength of the CSPC specimens . According to the experimental data the calculation formula of bond strength and the bond slip constitutive model were obtained then the bond slip constitutive model was applied to the spring element in ANSYS which could effectively simulate the bond slip situation between the corrugated steel plate with studs and the concrete . Finally the calculation formula considering the effect of the studs on the bond force was proposed and the results were generally conservative and suitable for engineering applications .
