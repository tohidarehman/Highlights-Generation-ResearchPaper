 The use of high strength steel in the construction of concrete encased steel composite columns is often limited by the strain incompatibility issue between HSS and concrete at peak load . This study proposes an alternative approach to confine the high strength concrete with Engineered Cementitious Composite to improve its compatibility with high strength steel . The main purpose of this study is to experimentally evaluate the axial compressive performance of the proposed composite column cross section configuration . Behaviours of fifteen short columns including twelve ECC CES columns are investigated in terms of failure modes load deformation curves ductility and energy absorption capacity . The test parameters included ECC and concrete strengths ECC cover thickness steel section shape and column sections aspect ratio . It was found that ECC generally improved the failure behaviour of high strength steel CES columns and increased the deformation and energy absorption capacity . On average ECC CES columns showed around 12 and 8 higher ductility and toughness than control concrete column respectively . A detailed 3D nonlinear finite element model was developed and validated against experimental results . Applicability of current design codes to predict the ultimate strength of ECC CES columns was also evaluated . Finally a method to calculate the ECC CES columns capacity considering effective material stresses at peak load was proposed .
