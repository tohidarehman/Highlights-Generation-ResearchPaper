 Coastal aquifers provide an important source of water globally . Understanding how groundwater responds to changes in rainfall recharge is important for sustainable development . To this end we investigate how water isotopes

@highlight Water isotopes show changes in rainfall influencing Rottnest Islands freshwater lens.
@highlight Seasonality shows higher chloride and lower tritium in summer after less rainfall.
@highlight Large heavy episodic rains are important for groundwater recharge.
