 Wastewater treatment plants are a significant pathway of microplastics to aquatic environments . To develop suitable management options and reduce microplastic emissions in treated effluent and sludge we must first develop a reliable method to understand their transport and fate throughout the treatment process . An improved methodology was applied to determine the size shape polymer type and partitioning behaviour of MPs using a combination of oxidation treatment fluorescent staining and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy to detect small MPs 20m in wastewater . The mean number of MPs detected using this methodology was 11.801.10MP L in raw sewage 5.230.25MP L in degritted wastewater 7.910.44MP L in waste activated sludge and 2.760.11MP L in the final treated effluent . An increase in MPs following primary screening suggests that WAS is a sink for several stealth microplastics including glitter which is returned to the effluent during the treatment process . The estimated MP removal efficiency for the studied WWTP is relatively poor compared with global data for secondary WWTPs which is likely due to the release of partially treated effluent into the Pacific Ocean via a second discharge point . The information generated through this study can be useful to firstly inform on site wastewater management practices and secondly reduce MP concentrations in final treated effluents discharged to the marine environment .
