 In the last two decades the advance in nighttime light remote sensing has fueled a surge in extensive research towards mapping human footprints . Nevertheless the full potential of NTL data is largely constrained by the blooming effect . In this study we propose a new concept the Pixel Blooming Effect to delineate the mutual influence of lights from a pixel and its neighbors and an integrated framework to eliminate the PiBE in radiance calibrated DMSP OLS datasets DMSP

@highlight A concept was proposed to characterize the blooming effect at pixel level.
@highlight An integrated framework was developed to model and correct the PiBE.
@highlight Low ISF pixels ISF 0.2 were sensitive to the impact of PiBE.
@highlight The proposed method was effective in eliminating the PiBE.
@highlight The lost data variation was recovered and pseudo lights in non BU were suppressed.
