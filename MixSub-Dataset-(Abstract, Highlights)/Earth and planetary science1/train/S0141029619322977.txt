 This paper presents the experimental study of lightweight concrete and normal concrete composite slabs with steel decking profile exposed to standard time temperature curve . LWC composite slabs are very efficient in terms of energy savings and sustainability due to their low values of thermal transmittance . In this study NC is used to compare the fire behaviour of LWC composite slabs . Dimensions of the slab are 160mm thick 1120mm wide and 2030mm long . In order to perform fire tests in the intermediate scale samples a non standard furnace was designed and assembled . The furnace is composed of a heating chamber a gas evacuation system and a portal frame . The heating chamber is made of a steel framework and refractory layers . The evacuation system which has an auxiliary vein with a fan to introduce air extracts hot gases . The portal frame is composed of steel profiles with a rotating beam equipped with a linear actuator to apply the load on the samples . This beam is opened to allow the slabs to be placed and closed during the test . Finally experimental results show that the time of fire resistance is close to 30min for both types of slabs . Free water within the slabs affects the temperature increase of concrete . Thus the temperature distribution inside the slab follows a non constant trend due to the movement and evaporation of the free water . Furthermore although there is de bonding between the steel and the slabs no spalling is detected .
