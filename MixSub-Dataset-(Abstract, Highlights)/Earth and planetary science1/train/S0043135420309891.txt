 Expansion in the size is an indispensable stage in the granular sludge life cycle but little attention has been payed to the enlargement mechanism of granular sludge . Here we propose a novel anammox granule enlargement mechanism by the self assembly of heterogenous granules . Two different colors of anammox granules dark red granules and bright red granules were found in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor . These two heterogenous granules were not isolated but were assembled into granules with a larger DR Granule in the center and many smaller BR Granules aggregated on the surface increasing the overall granular size . Their physiochemical characteristics in terms of EPS adherence rheological properties and microbial compositions were identified and compared to elucidate the interaction between the different colors of granules . The BR Granules created 92 more extracellular polymeric substances than the DR Granules . This material blocked the passage of gas and substrate leading to BR Granules smaller size and a yield stress approximately 48 lower than that of the DR Granules . Nevertheless the BR Granules had compact extracellular protein secondary structures and a high adherence rate to the surface of the DR Granules upon which they formed a compact adhered layer . These unique features enabled them to directionally adhere to DR Granules in the core that is two heterogenous colors of granules self assembled into large anammox granules . The enlargement mechanism was further supported by the abundance of

@highlight Two heterogenous colors anammox granules were found and self assembled into larger granules.
@highlight Their differences in physiochemical characteristics were analyzed to explain this self assembly pattern.
@highlight Self assembly of heterogenous granules was proposed for granule enlargement.
@highlight High anammox bacteria abundance in BR Granules caused their brighter red color.
