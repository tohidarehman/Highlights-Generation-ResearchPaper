 Polymeric photocatalysts are promising candidates for water purification however their catalytic performance are still unsatisfactory due to the fast charge recombination that leads to low reactive oxygen radicals production . In this study a conceptual energy transfer mediated photocatalytic oxygen activation system over polymeric carbon nitride without the need of electron hole separation is proposed exhibiting remarkable singlet oxygen triggered bacteria inactivation performance as well as organic pollutants degradation . By structure and excitonic effect modulation the oxygen activation process changes from the traditional electron transfer mechanism to the final energy transfer pathway leading to the selective generation of singlet oxygen with high efficiency . The generated singlet oxygen is found to fervently attack the bacteria membrane creating irreparable pores or holes on the cell membrane for cytoplasmic contents leaking out to accelerate bacteria destruction . The work demonstrated here offers a new photocatalytic oxygen activation pathway for achieving high efficient reactive oxygen species generation performance without the need of charge separation .
