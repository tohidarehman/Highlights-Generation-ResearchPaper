 True water color is an important water quality indicator . However despite many efforts for standardization of methods for TWC determination there is still no consistency between visual and spectroscopic techniques . This study demonstrates that standard spectroscopic methods overestimate visual data from 21 to 47 depending on methods involved .

@highlight Existed spectroscopic methods overestimates visual water color determination 2147 .
@highlight New spectroscopic method for true color determination in natural water is proposed.
@highlight Method is based on mathematical model of the standard observer color perception.
@highlight Proposed method show high agreement with visual methods mean relative difference 2 .
