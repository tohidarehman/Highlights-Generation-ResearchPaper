 Humic substance is a ubiquitous class of natural organic matter in soil and aquatic ecosystems which severely affects the terrestrial and aquatic environments as well as water based engineering systems by adsorption on solids via different interaction mechanisms . Herein the chemical force microscopy technique was employed to quantitatively probe the intermolecular forces of humic acid interacting with self assembled monolayers SAMs i.e . OH SAMs CH

@highlight Intermolecular forces of humic acid HA with self assembled monolayers SAMs are quantified.
@highlight HA SAMs adhesion energy is dependent on ionic strength ion type and pH.
@highlight Electrostatic attraction plays the dominant role followed by hydrophobic force and H bonding.
@highlight PH responsive adhesion energy of NH
@highlight  SAMs facilitates the adsorption and release of HA.
@highlight Recyclable APTES Fe
@highlight nanoparticles with NH
@highlight groups promise excellent HA removal.
