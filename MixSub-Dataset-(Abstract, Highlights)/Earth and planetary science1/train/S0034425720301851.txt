 Successful post fire management depends on accurate burn severity maps that are increasingly derived from satellite data replacing field based estimates . Post fire vegetation and soil changes besides modifying the reflected and emitted radiation recorded by sensors onboard satellites strongly alters water balance in the fire affected area . While fire induced spectral changes can be well represented by fraction images from Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis changes in water balance are mainly registered by evapotranspiration . As both types of variables have a clear physical meaning they can be easily understood in terms of burn severity providing a clear advantage compared to widely used spectral indices . In this research work we evaluate the potential of Landsat derived ET to estimate burn severity together with MESMA derived Sentinel 2 fraction images and important environment variables . In this study we use the random forest classifier which provides information on variable importance allowing us to identify the combination of input variables that provided the most accurate estimate . Our study area is located in Central Portugal where a mega fire burned 450km
