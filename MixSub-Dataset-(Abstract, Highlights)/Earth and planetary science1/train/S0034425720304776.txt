 Global lake evaporation is a critical component of the terrestrial water cycle . Accurate quantification of lake evaporation dynamics is of high importance for understanding lake energy budgets land atmosphere interactions as well as regional water availability . However the accurate quantification of lake evaporation has been hindered by the complexity involved with addressing the heat storage of water bodies . In this study a new modelthe Lake Temperature and Evaporation Model was developed to simulate lake water temperature profiles which were then used to calculate heat storage changes and evaporation rates . Inputs for the LTEM include the meteorological and bathymetric data as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer water surface temperature which is the land surface temperature over water . The MODIS WST was leveraged to constrain the hydrodynamic simulations . Model results over 11 lakes around the world show robust performance of LTEM . The long term average temperature biases range from 0.5 C to 0.5 C and the evaporation rate biases range from 0.19 mm day to 0.28 mm day . In particular it is found that LTEM significantly improves the simulation of the seasonality of lake evaporation rates . The validation results suggest that the averaged coefficient of determination R
