 Commercially available powdered activated carbon with a median diameter of 1242m was ground into 1m sized superfine PAC and 200nm sized submicron SPAC and investigated as a pretreatment material for the prevention of hydraulically irreversible membrane fouling during a submerged microfiltration process . Compared with PAC and SPAC SSPAC has a high capacity for selective biopolymer adsorption which is a characteristic found in natural organic matter and is commonly considered to be a major contributor to membrane fouling . Precoating the membrane surface with SSPAC during batch filtration further removes the biopolymers by straining them out . In lab scale membrane filtration experiments an increase in the transmembrane pressure was almost completely prevented through a precoating with SSPAC based on its pulse dose after coagulation pretreatment . The precoated SSPAC formed a dense layer on the membrane preventing biopolymers from attaching to the membrane . Coagulation pretreatment enabled the precoated activated carbon to be rinsed off during hydraulic backwashing . The functionality of the membrane was thereby retained for a long term operation . Precoating the membranes with SSPAC after coagulation is a promising way to control membrane fouling and efficiently prevents an increase in the TMP because of the straining effect of the SSPAC and the high capacity of the SSPAC to adsorb any existing biopolymers .

@highlight Submicron superfine PAC SSPAC median diameter 200nm adsorbed biopolymer well.
@highlight SSPAC removed biopolymer best due to straining effect and high adsorption capacity.
@highlight Precoating SSPAC on a membrane reduced the rise of transmembrane pressure TMP .
@highlight Precoating SSPAC after coagulation prevented the rise of TMP almost completely.
@highlight Pulse dosing for precoating prevented the rise of TMP better than continuous dosing.
