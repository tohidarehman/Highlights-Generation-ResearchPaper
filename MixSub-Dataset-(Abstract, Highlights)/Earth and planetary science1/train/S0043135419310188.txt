 Poor environmental technologies and gastrointestinal illnesses have been hypothesized to be a primary cause to the lack of impact of child health programs on child stunting rates in South Africa . This study assessed correlations between environmental exposures diarrheal occurrences and systemic inflammation proxies among female and male children under five years of age in the Eastern Cape . A conceptual model was hypothesized using structural equation modeling and two sex specific datasets were subsequently generated from the data and applied to the hypothesized SE model . Results suggested that environmental exposure variables associated with diarrhea and systemic inflammation proxies were different between females and males . For diarrheal occurrences among females an increase in local authority management of refuse 0.007 sharing sanitation facilities and a decrease in the frequency of the treatment of drinking water were correlated with an increase in diarrhea . For males an increase in household use of flush toilets was correlated with an increase in diarrhea . For systemic inflammation among both sexes an increase in household use of water pumped into the premises and an increase in diarrheal occurrences were correlated with an increase in systemic inflammation . The data support an increased focus on sex and gender specific factors among field practitioners and policy makers working in the environmental health field in South Africa .

@highlight Two of seven correlations between environment and health were shared between sexes.
@highlight Water treatment refuse sharing sanitation correlated with diarrhea for females.
@highlight Type of sanitation was correlated with diarrhea for males.
@highlight Water source and diarrhea correlated with systemic inflammation for both sexes.
