 The changing climate is affecting the frozen soil at an unprecedented rate across the Northern Hemisphere . However due to sparse ground measurements the changes of frozen soil and the environmental controls over the vast cryosphere are still unclear such as in the Tibetan Plateau . In this study a process based model solely driven by satellite remote sensing data is employed to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of seasonally frozen ground and permafrost over the entire TP 3 million km

@highlight Satellite based model well reproduced frozen soil changes FSC across the TP
@highlight Permafrost show consistent degradation over 20022016
@highlight Seasonally frozen ground show roughly competent increasing and decreasing trends
@highlight Both in season and off season LST are found to impact on FSC
@highlight Precipitation affects FSC in arid regions and regions near permafrost lower limit
