 The present study is concerned with the seismic analysis and design of light frame timber shear walls with focus on the energy dissipation ensured by sheathing to framing connections under in plane lateral loads . In this perspective a suitable parametric finite element model for light frame timber shear walls is first developed using the software OpenSees . By means of such model the equivalent viscous damping of the wall is assessed numerically together with the damping factor adopted within the capacity spectrum method . Furthermore the optimal layouts of slender 1.2m
