 The Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River was conducted from 2017 to 2018 in the semi arid Luan River watershed located in the North of China . One of the objectives of SMELR is to serve as an assessment tool and demonstration for a new Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite concept with one dimensional synthetic aperture microwave techniques for which soil moisture retrieval under variable satellite observing configurations is the greatest challenge . This proposed mission is targeted to provide continuity for the current satellite L band microwave observations and further improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture mapping through the synergistic use of active passive and optical remote sensing data . Multi resolution multi angle and multi spectral airborne data were obtained four times over a 70 km by 12 km area in the Shandian River basin and one time over a 165 km by 5 km area that includes the Xiaoluan River basin . The near surface soil moisture was measured extensively on the ground in fifty 1 km by 2 km quadrats and two hundred and fifty 200 m by 200 m quadrats corresponding to radar observations . Two networks were established for continuous measurement of the soil moisture and temperature profile and precipitation in the Shandian and Xiaoluan River basin respectively . Supporting ground measurements also included ground temperature vegetation water content surface roughness continuous measurement of microwave emission and backscatter at a pasture site reflectance of various land cover types evapotranspiration and aerosol observations . Preliminary results within the experimental area indicate that the near surface soil moisture spatial variability at a 200 m scale was up to 0.1 cm
