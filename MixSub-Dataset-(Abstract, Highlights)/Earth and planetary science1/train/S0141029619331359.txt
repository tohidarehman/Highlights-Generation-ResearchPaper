 Nowadays Buckling Restrained Braced Frame system is extensively used for the seismic design of new buildings . This system is composed of Buckling Restrained Braces that do not buckle under compression forces and have high energy dissipation capacity . However low post yield stiffness of the brace core in BRBs may cause large residual drifts after the occurrence of an earthquake . In this study four approximate methods for estimating residual drift demands in BRBFs are evaluated . These methods include the FEMA P 58 method the method proposed in this study the method proposed by Erochko et al . and the coefficients method introduced by Ruiz Garca and Chora calibrated in this study for BRBFs . To evaluate the estimated residual drifts of BRBFs according to these approximate methods 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 story BRBFs are designed . Nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed on the BRBFs using 78 ground motion records scaled to different ground motion intensity levels . The results show that the proposed method is more accurate than the FEMA P 58 and Erochko et al . methods that are conservative for estimating the median and mean residual drifts of BRBFs respectively . Moreover the coefficients method which estimates the median of maximum residual drifts is the most accurate method among the four methods considered . However it does not provide information about the height wise distribution of residual drifts .
