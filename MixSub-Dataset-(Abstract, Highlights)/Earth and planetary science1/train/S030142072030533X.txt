 This paper analyzes the long run relationships between resource dependence democracy and per capita economic growth in Iran using the ARDL approach of cointegration . We find that resource dependence and democracy have positive negative or no significant effect on the long term growth in Iranian GDP over the period 19702017 . This multifaceted result is an additional reason to explain the lack of consensus on the empirics of the political economy of the resource curse hypothesis . We show as the interpretation of statistical tests only based on the average effect of resource dependence on economic growth may be misleading .

@highlight Long run relationships between resource dependence democracy and growth exist in Iran.
@highlight Resource dependence may have an overall positive negative or no effect on growth.
@highlight Democracy may have an overall positive negative or no effect on growth.
@highlight We provide a graphical representation of the previous overall marginal effects.
@highlight We provide an additional explanation of the lack of clear findings in this literature.
