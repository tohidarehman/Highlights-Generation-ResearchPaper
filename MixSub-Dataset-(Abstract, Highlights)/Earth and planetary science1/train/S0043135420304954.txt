 The valorisation of protein rich residual streams by anaerobic mixed culture fermentation has been barely studied in contrast to carbohydrate rich wastes . The aim of this work was therefore to investigate how protein composition i.e . the amino acid profile affects the individual consumption of amino acids and consequently the outcome of the process . Mixed culture fermentations were performed with two model proteins using continuous and batch reactors at neutral pH values and 25C . The acidification was incomplete for both proteins with casein achieving a higher value than gelatin . Albeit dominated by acetic acid product spectra were different as well with n butyric acid as the second major product for casein and propionic acid for gelatin . The preferential consumption of amino acids was demonstrated which interestingly depends on protein composition . The previously accepted stoichiometry accurately describes iso and n butyric acid production but it fails for propionic iso and n valeric acid generation . Overall this study offers a better understanding of protein fermentation mechanisms which will help to improve degradation models and to design fermentation processes based on optimal substrate selection .

@highlight Protein fermentation generally results in incomplete acidification.
@highlight Balanced amino acid redox roles do not guarantee higher acidification degrees.
@highlight The preferential consumption of amino acids was demonstrated.
@highlight Protein composition affects acidification selectivity and preferential consumption.
@highlight The accepted stoichiometry is not sufficient to describe protein conversion to VFA.
