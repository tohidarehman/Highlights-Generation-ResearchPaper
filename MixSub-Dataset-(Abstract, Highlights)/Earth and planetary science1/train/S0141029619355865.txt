 This paper describes the development of finite element and analytical models for investigating the behavior of reinforced concrete columns strengthened with UHPFRC jackets under axial or eccentric loading . The main goal of both types of models is to produce load moment

@highlight FE modeling of jacketed columns captured the experimental response reasonably well.
@highlight Using adequate number of dowels led to a monolithic behavior of jacketed columns.
@highlight An analytical model was proposed to draw the interaction envelop of jacketed columns.
