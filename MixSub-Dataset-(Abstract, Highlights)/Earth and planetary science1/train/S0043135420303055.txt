 Proper granular activated carbon selection could improve the performance of biological activated carbon filters through a combination of adsorption and biodegradation while the GACs used in BAC filters are now mainly selected according to adsorption function ignoring biodegradation . In this study sand filter effluent obtained from a drinking water treatment plant was fed into continuous flow bench scale BAC columns operated in parallel over 245 days to examine the effects of GAC pore size distribution on BAC filter performance in terms of the dissolved organic carbon and disinfection byproduct precursors . A metagenomic analysis indicated that bacterial community structure played an important role in BAC filter performance . A significant correlation was found between metabolism related proteins and the volume of micro level macropores based on metaproteomic analysis . It is suggested that the adsorption saturation was dynamic and that adsorption played a role in the performance of the BAC filters throughout the 245 day operating period . Renewed adsorption capacity or bioregeneration was driven by bacterial metabolic activity . Such activity largely depended on the organic matter adsorbed by the GAC in which micro level macropores especially those with diameters of 0.210m played an important but previously unrecognized role . The results suggest that more attention should be paid to well developed pores and pore size distribution in the production and selection of GAC used for full scale drinking water biofilters .
