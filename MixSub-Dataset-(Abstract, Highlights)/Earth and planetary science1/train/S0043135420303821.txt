 Extracellular polymeric substances have been considered as a barrier for toxic species penetration into the cells but their function in protecting electroactive biofilms had been rarely revealed . In this study the anode potential was used to regulate the EPS quantity and components in mixed culture EABs where their resistance to Ag

@highlight EABs grown at 0V showed higher resistance to Ag than those at0.2 0.2 and 0.4V.
@highlight EPS were mostly produced at 0V with proteins and humic acid as the main components.
@highlight The proteins and humic acid in LB EPS play important roles in anti Ag
@highlight shock.
@highlight The oxygen and nitrogen moieties in LB EPS were responsible for binding Ag
@highlight The anode potential shows a potential in modulation of EPS production in EABs.
