 In this study shaking table tests were performed to investigate the dynamic interaction of a silty clay soil with an irregular section subway station . During the tests a shape acceleration array was used to measure the lateral deformation of the model soil and a non contact dynamic displacement testing method was applied to visualize and digitalize the seismic damage process of the station structure . Typical test results including the dynamic earth pressure seismic settlement deformation and acceleration of different levels of the structure were interpreted . The results indicated that the movement of the subway station was more controlled by the surrounding silty clay soil in terms of phase and amplitude . SAA can effectively measure the soil deformation and the relationship between the relative lateral displacement and soil depth can be well fitted in a cosine function especially when subjected to strong earthquakes . Seismic settlement is significantly linked to Arias intensity and the subway station experienced significant uneven settlement resulting in soil structure separation in the vertical direction . The multi story irregular section subway station deforms in a shear mode . The maximum inter story drift ratio was approximately 1 171 . The components in the lower layers of the shallow buried subway station structure particularly in the central columns underwent cumulative damage . Hence more robust forms of structural members and the ductility of central columns should be carefully considered in the seismic design of subway station structures .

@highlight Seismic response and damage mechanism of irregular section underground structure in a soft site were researched.
@highlight Some advanced testing method were used to measure the deformation of the site and underground structure.
@highlight Soil Surface settlement is significantly correlated with Arias intensity.
