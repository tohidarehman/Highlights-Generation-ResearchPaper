 Connections in cross laminated timber structures are crucial components that can affect the behaviour of the whole structure . A novel framework that integrates the unscented Kalman filter as an estimation tool with a hysteretic model is developed to identify the model parameters of a nonlinear system . The UKF estimates the mean and covariance of the model parameters using unscented transformation by a set of deterministically chosen sample points . The proposed framework is applied to identify the unknown model parameters of CLT connections using available experimental data where the cycle behaviour of CLT connections is simulated using a spring element assigned to the hysteretic model . The comparison of hysteretic curves between the test and model shows that the results identified with UKF are precise . Two different approaches are proposed an assessment according to the EN 12512 standard and a damage accumulation assessment . The EN 12512 standard assessment is evaluated from the elastic stiffness ductility ratio and energy dissipation whereas the damage accumulation assessment considers the effects of low amplitude and accumulated damage . Together these two methods fully evaluate the identified result and the mechanical characteristics of CLT connections . The proposed procedure of parameter identification using the UKF can be applied to other connections in timber engineering .
