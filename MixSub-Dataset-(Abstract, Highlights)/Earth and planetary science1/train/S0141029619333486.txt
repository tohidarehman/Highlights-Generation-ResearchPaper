 A new self centering precast concrete beamcolumn connection with variable friction dampers is proposed to enhance the stiffness and energy dissipation after gap opening occurs at the beamcolumn interface where a hidden corbel is placed to increase the vertical shear capacity and construction efficiency . Especially the VFDs are composed of grooved steel plates instead of the flat steel plates used in most common friction dampers which enhances the flexibility of seismic design . Applying grooved steel plates with different geometric characteristics and adjusting the key design parameters including the initial post tensioned forces pre stressing clamping forces applied to friction bolts and number of PT tendons a series of tests was conducted on a full scale beamcolumn specimen to investigate the hysteretic behavior of such HCVFDSCPC beamcolumn connections . Incorporating the characteristics of twice activation for VFDs with the different seismic requirements for various seismic levels the theoretical basis was proposed and some recommendations were obtained for the seismic design of structures containing such beamcolumn connections . The experimental and theoretical results show that the arrangement of these VFDs in the beamcolumn connection achieved the expected self centering capacity and hysteretic behavior of variable stiffness and energy dissipation after gap opening occurred at the beamcolumn connection . The hysteretic behavior of variable stiffness and energy dissipation is observed to be sensitive to the details of the VFDs initial force number of PT tendons and pre stressing clamping forces applied to friction forces .
