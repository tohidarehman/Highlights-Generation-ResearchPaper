 High loaded ammonia and low strength organics mature landfill leachate is not effectively treated by conventional biological processes . Herein an innovative solution was proposed using a three stage Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation Denitrifying process . Firstly ammonia in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor . Next 93 PN SBR effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification . Finally ammonia released by fermentation in the IFD SBR and residual 7 nitrite in the PN SBR were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation process in the SAD up flow anaerobic sludge bed . In addition N

@highlight Three stage SAD process was firstly developed for simultaneous nitrogen removal and external sludge reduction.
@highlight Nitrogen removal efficiency of 98.3 and external sludge reduction rate of 2.5kg m
@highlight d were realized.
@highlight Anammox was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in SAD UASB with a percentage of 83.1 .
@highlight COD demand sludge production and oxygen consumption were largely reduced.
