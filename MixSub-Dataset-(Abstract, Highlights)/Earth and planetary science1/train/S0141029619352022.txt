 The paper describes and evaluates application of output only system identification to an eleven span post tensioned concrete bridge using hybrid excitation . A linear chirp sweeping force induced by two light weight electro dynamic shakers augmented environmental sources to excite the bridge during the hybrid testing exercise . To obtain the modal characteristics of the structure two output only time domain system identification methods were employed namely auto regressive time series model and eigensystem realization algorithm with observer Kalman identification with the traditional data driven stochastic subspace identification method providing a comparative benchmark . The accuracy and efficiency of both system identification algorithms when used on hybrid testing data are investigated and compared to the results from purely ambient vibration testing data . The study demonstrates that using both output only identification algorithms the collected vibration responses induced by the proposed hybrid vibration testing methodology can be used for extracting modal parameters with enhanced accuracy and reliability for the large scale post tensioned concrete bridge due to the increase in the excitation strength and better coverage of the relevant frequency bands . Compared to the classical SSI data the AR and ERA OKID techniques were able to identify more modes at reduced computational cost when applied to voluminous data from multi channel measurements .
