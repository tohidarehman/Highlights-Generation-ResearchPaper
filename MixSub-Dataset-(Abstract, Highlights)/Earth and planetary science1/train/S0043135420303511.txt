 Drinking water supply wells can be contaminated by a broad range of waterborne pathogens . However groundwater assessments frequently measure microbial indicators or a single pathogen type which provides a limited characterization of potential health risk . This study assessed contamination of wells by testing for viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens and fecal markers . Wells supplying groundwater to community and noncommunity public water systems in Minnesota USA were sampled every other month over one or two years and tested using 23 qPCR assays . Eighteen genetic targets were detected at least once and microbiological contamination was widespread . The sewage associated microbial indicators HF183 and pepper mild mottle virus were detected frequently . Human or zoonotic pathogens were detected in 70 of wells and 21 of samples by qPCR with

@highlight Repeated well testing for 23 gene targets identified widespread contamination.
@highlight Bacteria and protozoa were detected more frequently than viruses.
@highlight Pathogens were detected in 70 of 145 wells and 21 of 964 samples.
@highlight HF183 and pepper mild mottle virus poorly predicted pathogen presence in wells.
@highlight Pathogen indicator ratios in well water were much higher than ratios for sewage.
