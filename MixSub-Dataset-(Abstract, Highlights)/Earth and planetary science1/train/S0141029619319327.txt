 The unknown a priori position of bond related joints in the strut and tie systems used in reinforced concrete modelling is determined in this paper by developing a simple model concerning a single stiff and strong deformed bar that is embedded in a reinforced concrete member . The model takes into account the bonded length the bond stress profile and the nature of the bond along the tie basically by

@highlight Roles of microcracked and solid concrete in the bonding of long anchored bars and ties.
@highlight Clear subdivision between stress transfer by interlock and by adhesion in bonded ties.
@highlight Direct introduction of bond in strut and tie systems.
@highlight Rational identification of the position of bond related joints in strut and tie systems to improve safety checks.
@highlight Simple model to investigate the roles of stirrups and rebars in anchored ties in RC.
