 Flow electrode capacitive deionization is an attractive variant of CDI with distinct advantages over fixed electrode CDI including the capability for seawater desalination high flow efficiency and easy management of the electrodes . Challenges exist however in increasing treatment capacity with this attempted here through use of a membrane stack configuration . By comparison of standardised metrics energy normalized removed salt and productivity results show that that an FCDI system with two pairs of ion exchange membranes had the highest efficiency in desalting a brackish influent 1000mgL

@highlight Membrane stack configuration increases FCDI treatment capacity.
@highlight Standardised metrics ASRR and ENRS are used for comparison.
@highlight FCDI with two pairs of ion exchange membranes has the highest efficiency.
@highlight High energy efficiency and productivity is achievable in semi continuous operation.
