 Accurate bathymetric data is essential for marine coastal ecosystems and related studies . In the past decades a lot of studies were investigated to obtain bathymetric data in shallow waters using satellite remotely sensed data . Satellite multispectral imagery has been widely used to estimate shallow water depths based on empirical models and physics based models . However the
