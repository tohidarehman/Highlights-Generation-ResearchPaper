 According to the current codes and guidelines shear assessment of existing reinforced concrete slab bridges sometimes leads to the conclusion that the bridge under consideration has insufficient shear capacity . The calculated shear capacity however does not consider the transverse redistribution capacity of slabs and thus leads to overly conservative values . While mechanics based models have attempted to describe the problem of one way shear in concrete slabs under concentrated loads this problem is still not fully understood . Therefore this paper proposes an artificial neural network based formula to come up with estimates of the shear capacity of one way reinforced concrete slabs under a concentrated load that are as good as possible based on 287 test results obtained from the literature . The methods used for this purpose are the development of the database with experimental results from the literature and the development of the ANN based matrix formulation . For the latter purpose many thousands of ANN models were generated based on 475 distinct combinations of fifteen typical ANN features . The proposed optimal model yields maximum and mean relative errors of 0.0 for the 287 datapoints . Moreover it was illustrated to clearly outperform mean

@highlight This paper presents a database of 287 reinforced concrete slabs failing in shear.
@highlight Artificial neural networks are used to find a matrix based expression.
@highlight The developed expression is proposed for the assessment of slab bridges.
@highlight As mechanical models are lacking the presented expression can be used to predict the shear capacity of slabs.
@highlight The matrix based expression gives insight in the sensitivity to certain parameters.
