 Continuous reinforced concrete beams may develop significant plastic rotations to enable the redistribution of bending moments . These rotations occur at plastic hinges which are subject to high shear forces . The influence of rotations on the shear strength for statically determined beams without shear reinforcement failing in shear after yielding of the flexural reinforcement has already been experimentally verified . However this influence has not been studied in continuous members with shear reinforcement . An innovative tests system has been specially designed to develop shear failures before and after yielding of the flexural reinforcement in both statically determinate and indeterminate structures .

@highlight Crack rotation detected by a different rotation of bodies over and below the CSC.
@highlight Concrete shear strength decreases with bending rotation and crack width.
@highlight Codes do not properly capture the shear strength reduction due to bending rotation.
