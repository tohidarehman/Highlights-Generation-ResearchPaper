 A steeltimber composite column made of H shaped steel and glulam is proposed in this paper . This STC column is constructed by wrapping the H shaped steel with the adhesive applied glulam which provides confinement to reduce the buckling behaviour of the inner steel . Six STC specimens with lengths of 1100mm 1700mm and 2300mm were studied using an axial compression test in comparison to three steel and three timber specimens . The distinctive behaviours of the specimens were identified including the failure mode loadaxial displacement relationship loadlateral deflection relationship and loadaxial strain response . The results demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the STC column are significantly affected by column length . The interaction mechanism between the steel and timber materials was evaluated by analysing the yield strain and the ductility coefficient . The composite effect of the STC column was also discussed by comparing the average strengths . Furthermore the load carrying capacity calculation formula including parameter selection of the STC column when yielding was proposed .

@highlight A new composite column with H shaped steel and glulam was proposed.
@highlight Both overall and local inner steel buckling of the STC column can be monitored by measured strain.
@highlight An equation for calculating the load carrying capacity of the STC column when yielding was proposed.
