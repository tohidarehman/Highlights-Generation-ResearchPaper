 In this work Fe catalyzing sodium percarbonate SPC was managed to facilitate waste activated sludge dewatering for the first time . The results showed that after WAS was treated by 20mg g total suspended solids Fe and 50mg g TSS SPC the water content of sludge cake WC

@highlight Fe II SPC was firstly developed to dewater sludge and the mechanism was uncovered.
@highlight Thixotropic and viscoelastic behaviors of sludge were modified by Fe II SPC.
@highlight Bound EPS of sludge were collapsed and fragmented by Fe II SPC.
@highlight Conformation of extracellular proteins structure was altered by Fe II SPC.
@highlight Fe II SPC damaged cell wall and permeabilized cytoplasmic membrane in sludge.
