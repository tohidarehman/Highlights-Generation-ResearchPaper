 This paper experimentally investigated the seismic behavior of 9 full scale reinforced concrete joints8 precast RC joints and 1 cast in place RC jointunder cyclic loading . The precast concrete joints were divided into 3 types cast in place precast beam cast in place column and fully precast with assembly . With the presence additional reinforcement at the joint core and debonding of reinforcement in some joints the PC joints differed with other types of joints . The experimental results such as hysteretic behavior energy dissipation capacity and stiffness degradation were analyzed which showed that the PC joints with steel strands anchored into the joint core zone could meet the seismic code requirements . Additionally a finite elementanalysis of the new type of PC joint was performed numerically and the predicted seismic performance was in very good agreement with the experimental results . Finally a skeleton model of the PC joint was established through parameter analysis .
