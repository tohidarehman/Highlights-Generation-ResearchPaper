 This research aims at the seismic assessment and understanding of a traditional loadbearing system incorporating horizontal timber elements into earth brick masonry walls . In order to characterize the global behavior of the loadbearing device an experimental campaign was performed on the constituents and on masonry samples . Compression tests were carried out on four geometries of earth brick samples and three geometries of earth mortar samples . As the methods to obtain the compressive strength of earth material are still discussed within the scientific community a focus was made on different configurations tested . Uniaxial compression tests were performed on two earth brick wallets . Then two brick walls were submitted to lateral quasi static cyclic load . A LVDTs system and a stereo correlation image system were coupled to study the experimental response of the reinforced and unreinforced walls . This investigation led to estimate the lateral strength the stiffness degradation and the dissipated energy of both reinforced and unreinforced masonry walls . Moreover it allowed the comparison between the failure modes of the two types of wall . This analysis brings light on the mechanical impact of the horizontal reinforcement .
