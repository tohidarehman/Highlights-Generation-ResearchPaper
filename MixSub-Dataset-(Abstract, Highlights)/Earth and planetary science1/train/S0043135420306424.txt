 Although the ozonation of common antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin in water has been well studied the influence of bromide that is present at high levels in seawater is essentially unknown . In this study we investigated the effect of bromide on the reaction kinetics formation of transformation products reaction pathways and toxicity in the ozonation of CIP . Bromide significantly accelerated the transformation of CIP by ozone likely due to the formation of reactive bromine species . Based on time of flight high resolution mass spectrometry and suspect screening a total of 26TPs including 13 previously unknown products were identified in artificial seawater while only 9 of them were found in pure water without bromide . The transformation of CIP in artificial seawater was found to involve four major processes oxidation at the piperazinyl moiety with the addition of hydroxyl group to the ring and ring cleavage oxidation at the quinolone moiety and bromination . In contrast the ozonation of CIP in pure water occurred only at the piperazinyl moiety . In addition bromide also enhanced the removal of toxicity towards
