 The Sustainable Development Goals recognize that the availability and quality of improved water sources affect how households use and benefit from these sources . Although unreliability in piped water supplies in low and middle income countries has been described few studies have assessed household coping strategies in response to unreliable water supplies and associated health outcomes . We characterized unreliability in the piped water supply of the town of Borbn Ecuador over the twelve years following a major upgrade as well as household coping strategies and associations with diarrhea . We examined trends in primary and secondary drinking water sources water storage and water treatment using longitudinal data collected from 2005 to 2012 . In 2017 a follow up survey was administered
