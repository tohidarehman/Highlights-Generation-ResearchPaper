 Viruses represent one of the most important threats to agriculture . Several viral families include highly stable pathogens which remain infective and can be transported long distances in water . The diversity of plant viruses in wastewater remains understudied however their potential impact is increasing with the increased irrigation usage of reclaimed wastewater . To determine the abundance diversity and biological relevance of plant viruses in wastewater influents and effluents we applied an optimized virus concentration method followed by high throughput sequencing and infectivity assays . We detected representatives of 47 plant virus species including emerging crop threats . We also demonstrated infectivity for pathogenic and economically relevant plant viruses from the genus
