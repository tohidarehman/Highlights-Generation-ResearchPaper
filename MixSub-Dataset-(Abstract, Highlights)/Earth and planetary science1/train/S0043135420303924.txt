 This paper aims to elucidate the role of extracellular polymeric substances in regulating anion and cation concentrations and toxicity towards microorganisms in anaerobic granular sludges adapted to low 0.22M of Na

@highlight Electrodialysis can be used to characterize extracellular polymeric substances EPS .
@highlight EPS repel anions and act as cation exchange membranes.
@highlight EPS of salt adapted granular sludge are selective towards potassium transport.
@highlight Toxicity of monovalent ions towards methanogens may be related to their transport properties in EPS.
