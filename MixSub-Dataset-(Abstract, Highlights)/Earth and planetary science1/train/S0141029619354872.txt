 Most of the current time variant reliability analysis methods are applicable for only random variables . However some of the uncertain parameters can only be easily modeled by interval variables in many engineering applications . The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new time variant reliability analysis method for nonlinear limit state function with the coexistence of random variables and interval uncertain variables . Three primary strategies are put forward . Firstly the stochastic process in the time variant limit state function is discretized equivalently gaining several static limit state functions at different time . Secondly each static limit state function is linearized at the most probable point and the worst case point of interval variable by doing which the ordinary time dependent reliability problem is equally transformed into a static reliability one with mixed uncertain variables . Finally complex nested optimization problems using sequential iterations are effectively solved in mixed reliability calculation . The proposed method can obtain structural reliability considering time effects and mixed uncertainties . The effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by four numerical examples .

@highlight A time varying reliability analysis approach with mixed uncertainties is presented.
@highlight The time varying reliability problem is equivalently changed into time invariant one with hybrid uncertainties.
@highlight In order to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the method a dual loop Monte Carlo method is proposed.
