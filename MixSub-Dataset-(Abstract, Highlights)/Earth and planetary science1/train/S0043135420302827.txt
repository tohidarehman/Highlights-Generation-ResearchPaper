 Widespread occurrence of emerging organic contaminants in water have been explicitly associated with adverse effects on human health therefore representing a major risk to public health . Especially the increased toxicity is frequently observed during the photodegradation of EOCs in natural water and even wastewater treatment plants . However the culprit of increased toxicity and formation mechanism has yet to be recognized regarding the estrogenic activity . In this study by combining laboratory experiments with quantum chemical calculations the induction of human estrogenic activity was investigated using the yeast two hybrid reporter assay during the photodegradation of preservatives ethylparaben along with identification of toxic products and formation mechanisms . Results showed that the increase in estrogenic effect was induced by photochemically generated oligomers rather than the expected OH adduct . The maximum estrogenic activity corresponded to the major formation of oligomers while OH adducts were less than 12 . Two photochemically generated oligomers were found to contribute to estrogenic activity produced from the cleavage of excited triplet state molecules and subsequent radical radical reactions . Computational toxicology results showed that the increased estrogenic activity was attributed to oligomer and its EC

@highlight The estrogenic activity increased during ethyl paraben photochemical transformation.
@highlight Hydroxylated product was not responsible for the increase of estrogenic activity.
@highlight The EC
@highlight of hydroxylated product 3 EP OH is first reported as 2.3210

@highlight Photo oligomers were the potential reason why the increased estrogenic effect.
@highlight Excited triplet state was the main RS during ethyl paraben phototransformation.
