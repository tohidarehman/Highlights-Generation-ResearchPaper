 Todays wastewater utilities are facing the dilemma of balancing pathological threats of bacteria and viruses in their effluent against health threats associated with the byproducts of disinfection . A possible solution to this dilemma is to adopt secondary treatment technologies capable of concurrent pathogen reduction minimizing the demand for external disinfectants . Towards this end bacterial and viral reductions possible in algal wastewater treatment systems are highlighted here and compared with those in conventional activated sludge systems and membrane bioreactor systems . High log reduction values of

@highlight Mixotrophic system affords pathogen reduction concurrent to BOD and nutrient reduction.
@highlight Demonstrated bacteria and virus reduction by
@highlight based system.
@highlight Mixotrophic system enables higher log removals than phototrophic systems.
@highlight Mixotrophic system affords superior pathogen reduction than activated sludge system.
