 Bioelectrochemical systems have long been viewed as a promising wastewater treatment technology . However in reality the performance of bioelectrochemical systems fed with real wastewaters is often disappointing . We have sought to investigate the combined impacts of complex substrates and presence of electron acceptors . In particular this study illustrates and systematically evaluates the disparity in performance between a BES acclimatised with acetate and those acclimatised with more complex carbohydrates and in the presence and absence of sulphate . Relative to acetate only operating with complex carbohydrates reduced current by 73 87 and coulombic efficiency by 4 50 . Acclimation with complex carbohydrates seriously impeded the colonisation anode by

@highlight After acclimation sulphate reduction had a negligible impact on performance.
