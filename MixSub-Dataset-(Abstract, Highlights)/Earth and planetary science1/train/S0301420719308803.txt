 Mining activities have a positive impact on local communities through providing formal employment opportunities in the local area . However the air and noise pollution associated with surface mining represent a negative externality for residents in communities near mining activity . To support urban planning processes accurate information on both the positive and negative impacts of surface mining is required . In this study we estimate the dis amenity of proximity to a large open pit gold mine in Kalgoorlie Western Australia that has been capitalised into residential property values . To estimate the impact of proximity to the mine on property values we use sales data for 21 850 residential properties sold in Kalgoorlie Boulder between 1990 and 2018 . We use distance to the mine as a measure of the impact . We control for spatial heterogeneity using spatial fixed effects . We found that residential properties located within two kilometres of the mine trade at a 20 to 30 discount to similar residential properties located at least six to seven kilometres from the mine . Our results can be used for planning appropriate buffer zones around mining activities .

@highlight Mining provides economic benefits but also creates dis amenities for adjacent communities.
@highlight Hedonic pricing method was used to examine the dis amenity of an open cut mine.
@highlight Local residents pay 20 30 less for properties located within 2Km of the mine relative to the properties located 6 to 7Km away.
@highlight The study can be used by planners to set appropriate buffer zones around mines.
