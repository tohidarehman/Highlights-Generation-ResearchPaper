 Edible salt is essential to the health of humans and serves as a seasoning universally . Besides chloride edible salt also contains other anions such as bromide fluoride sulfate and carbonate due to incomplete removal during raw salt refinement . In a household cooking process a chlorine monochloramine residual in tap water could react with bromide in edible salt and organic matter in food to form numerous brominated disinfection byproducts at significant levels which might induce adverse health effects to human beings . In this study we solicited 20 edible salts of different types from nine countries and determined their bromide levels to be 67375mg kg with an average level of 173mg kg . A total of 25 polar Br DBPs were detected and identified with structures formulae in cooking water samples using ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadruple mass spectrometry and high resolution mass spectrometry . Effects of cooking conditions on the formation of polar Br DBPs were investigated and optimized cooking conditions with minimized formation of polar Br DBPs were determined . Further aided with an Hep G2 cell cytotoxicity assay it was found that the overall cytotoxicity of chlorinated and chloraminated cooking water samples prepared after cooking condition optimization was reduced by 57 and 22 respectively compared with those prepared before cooking condition optimization .
