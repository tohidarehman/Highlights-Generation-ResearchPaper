 Microplastics are very complex pollutants they can be made of many polymer types and exist in various shapes and sizes . When they enter the environment they are affected by biotic and abiotic factors that cause their properties to change . In this context the aim of our study was to evaluate the extent to which biofouling affects the properties and toxicity of microplastics . Cosmetic polyethylene microbeads were incubated in stream water for four weeks resulting in biofouling and aging . Subsequently the changes in properties and the microplastics toxicity to daphnids

@highlight Biofouling aging of microplastics MPs significantly alters their properties.
@highlight Adsorption of Ag and its leaching is enhanced on MPs with a biofilm.
@highlight Environmentally relevant concentrations of aged MPs with Ag affect organisms.
@highlight MPs with adsorbed silver had high ecotoxicological potential.
