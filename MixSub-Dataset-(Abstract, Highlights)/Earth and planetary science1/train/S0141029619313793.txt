 This paper presents progressive collapse simulations to assess the robustness of a seismic resistant building using self centering moment resisting frames under a sudden column loss scenario . The first floor of the building including the composite floor was modelled in ABAQUS using a mixture of finite element types and simulation methods to balance computational cost and accuracy . First key components of the numerical model including the composite beams the fin plate beam column connections and the perimeter SC MRFs were validated against available experimental results to ensure a reliable simulation . The validated model was then used to study the robustness of the building under a sudden column loss event . Both nonlinear static and dynamic analyses were employed . The simulations allowed for the identification of all possible failure modes and the quantification of the contribution of the composite floor to the robustness of the frame . The results show that the building can withstand the code prescribed load with a safety factor of 2 and that the structural limit state that triggers progressive collapse is the buckling of the gravity columns . The Dynamic Increase Factor was also identified by comparing the static and dynamic responses .
