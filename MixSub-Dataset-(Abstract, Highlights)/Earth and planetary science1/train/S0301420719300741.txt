 The adoption and implementation of innovation offers the mining sector the opportunity to tackle some of its most pressing challenges . However there are a range of stakeholders and barriers which can potentially impede and hinder the diffusion of innovation in the mining industry . This paper relies on a systematic literature review approach to map and synthesise drivers and barriers to the diffusion and adoption of innovation and to identify stakeholders impacting on these processes within the specific context of the mining sector . We also synthesise current knowledge in terms of geographical contexts of prior research sampling and theoretical foundations . Our findings and mapping enables researchers and practitioners to identify potential barriers and influential stakeholders in a given context within the mining sector . We also discuss important knowledge gaps pertaining to the diffusion of innovation in mining and outline promising opportunities for future research . These are related to system level and context incorporating research specific operational demands under researched stakeholders such as the workforce and intangible impediments such as organisational culture .
