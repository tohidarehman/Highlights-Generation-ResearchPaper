 This paper focusses on the performance of bolted shear connectors embedded in concrete slab when subjected to static and fatigue loading . The static and fatigue capacities of shear connectors between concrete slabs and steel beams are important issues as existing composite structures experience complex loadings during their functional working life . The conventional headed stud shear connector is the most common form of shear connection in composite construction in contrast the high strength bolts are not commonly used as shear connectors . Among different types of bolted shear connectors the ability of blind bolt shear connectors to be attached and detached from one side of a structure resulting in faster installation and reduce the environmental cost is attractive . Therefore in this study stiffness ultimate strength and ductility of blind bolt shear connector were examined through static tests . Furthermore high cycle fatigue tests were conducted to develop a S N curve for the blind bolt shear connectors . In addition failure modes of this type of shear connector were identified in detail .

@highlight The paper investigated the bolted shear connectors behaviour understatic and fatigue loading.
@highlight Stiffness ultimate strength and ductility of welded stud and blind bolt were investigated.
@highlight The experimental results used to understand S N curve that link to the fatigue life of blind bolt.
@highlight Fatigue strength of the bolted shear connectors compared with design equations of the headed stud.
@highlight Fatigue failure of bolted shear connector and the local failure of concrete were studied in detail.
