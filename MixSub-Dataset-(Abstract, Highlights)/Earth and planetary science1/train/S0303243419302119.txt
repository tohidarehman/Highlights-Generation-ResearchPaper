 The goal of this study was to evaluate whether harmonic regression coefficients derived using all available cloud free observations in a given Landsat pixel for a three year period can be used to estimate tree canopy cover and whether models developed using harmonic regression coefficients as predictor variables are better than models developed using median composite predictor variables the previous operational standard for the National Land Cover Database . The two study areas in the conterminous USA were as follows West bounded by Landsat Worldwide Reference System 2 paths rows 43 30 44 30 and 45 30 and South bounded by WRS 2 paths rows 16 37 17 37 and 18 37 . Plot specific tree canopy cover was collected by experienced interpreters using a dot grid overlaid on 1m spatial resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program images at two different times per region circa 2010 and circa 2014 . Random forest model comparisons revealed the following harmonic regression coefficients are better predictors for every time region of TCC than median composite focal means and standard deviations across times regions mean increase in pseudo R

@highlight Harmonic regression coefficients are better predictors of tree canopy cover than median composite components.
@highlight Per pixel prediction variance was obtained from the mean variance of 500 independent model runs.
@highlight Harmonic regression variables are less influenced by noise than median composite variables.
@highlight Use of all available image data obviates the need for cloud free scenes near peak growing season.
