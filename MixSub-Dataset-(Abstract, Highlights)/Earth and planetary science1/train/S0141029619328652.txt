 The optimum design and analysis of frictional multiple tuned mass dampers are presented in this study where Coulomb dry friction is incorporated as an energy dissipation mechanism . To deal with the nonlinearity of the Coulomb dry friction force which is a source of difficulty in the optimization process this study adopted a statistical linearization that replaces the original nonlinear system with an equivalent linear system and found an optimum design that minimized the root mean square displacement of the primary structure . The equivalent damping ratio of a tuned mass damper unit significantly decreased with the increase in number of TMDs . Four practical configurations were formulated and comparatively analyzed by constraining the frequency ratios and the coefficient of friction . Among the four investigated cases a particular solution described using only three parameters is recommended for use in design because it is simple and sufficiently accurate . We also analyzed the input sensitivity of nonlinear frequency responses of FMTMDs in order to provide general design guidance .
