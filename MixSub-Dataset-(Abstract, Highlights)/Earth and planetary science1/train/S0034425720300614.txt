 Air temperature is an essential climatological component that controls and influences various earth surface processes . In this study we make the first attempt to employ deep learning for Ta mapping mainly based on space remote sensing and ground station observations . Considering that Ta varies greatly in space and time and is sensitive to many factors assimilation data and socioeconomic data are also included for a multi source data fusion based estimation . Specifically a 5 layers structured deep belief network is employed to better capture the complicated and non linear relationships between Ta and different predictor variables . Layer wise pre training process for essential features extraction and fine tuning process for weight parameters optimization ensure the robust prediction of Ta spatio temporal distribution . The DBN model was implemented for 0.01 daily maximum Ta mapping across China . The ten fold cross validation results indicate that the DBN model achieves promising results with the RMSE of 1.996C MAE of 1.539C and R of 0.986 at the national scale . Compared with multiple linear regression back propagation neural network and random forest method the DBN model reduces the MAE values by 1.340C 0.387C and 0.222C respectively . Further analysis on spatial distribution and temporal tendency of prediction errors both validate the great potentials of DBN in Ta estimation .
