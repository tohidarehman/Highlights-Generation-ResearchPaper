 Satellite remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation products are widely used in land surface monitoring and modeling especially for estimating global terrestrial photosynthetic activity through light use efficiency models . PAR absorbed by active chlorophyll APAR

@highlight We intercompared six currently available satellite FPAR products.
@highlight Their potential relationships with FPAR
@highlight were evaluated with SIF data.
@highlight OLCI FPAR showed the best relationships with satellite and airborne nSIF.
@highlight APAR derived from OLCI FPAR exhibited the best relationship with
@highlight GPP.
