 It is crucial for highway bridges to remain operational after strong earthquakes as they are critical infrastructures to transport resources . In this study an innovative seismic resilient bridge structural system named controlled rocking dual fused bridge system is proposed . The CRDFB system is designed to dissipate the earthquake energy by the use of replaceable Lead Extrusion Dampers at the base of the rocking piers . The state of the art Equivalent Energy Design Procedure is adopted and modified to design the CRDFB system to achieve different performance at different levels of shaking intensities . The proposed step by step EEDP allows engineers to design the CRDFB system to achieve the desired performance objectives with simple hand calculations and without iterations . A 2 span and a 3 span CRDFB prototypes located in Vancouver Canada are designed using the proposed EEDP . To validate the performance of the proposed CRDFB system advanced three dimensional analytical models of prototypes are developed using OpenSees and subjected to a broad array of two dimensional and three dimensional nonlinear time history analyses . Simulation results show that CRDFB prototypes can successfully achieve the targeted performance as specified by EEDP design at different shaking intensities . Hence the proposed CRDFB system can be designed efficiently using the EEDP design procedure outlined in this paper and be used as an efficient reliable and resilient seismic force resisting bridge system for high seismic zones .
