 Machine learning modeling techniques have emerged as a potential means for predicting algal blooms . In this study synthetic spatio temporal water quality data for a river section were generated with a 3D water quality model and used to investigate the capability of a convolutional neural network for predicting harmful cyanobacterial blooms . The CNN model displayed a reasonable capacity for short term predictions of cyanobacteria biomass . In the nowcasting of Microcystis the CNN performance had a Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.87 . An increase in the forecast lead time resulted in a decrease in the prediction accuracy reducing the NSE from 0.87 to 0.58 . As the spatial observation density increased from 20 to 100 of the input image grids the CNN prediction NSE had improved from 0.70 to 0.84 . Adding noise to the data resulted in accuracy deterioration but even at the noise amplitude of 10 the accuracy was acceptable for some applications with NSE 0.76 . Visualization of the CNN results characterized its performance variations across the studied river reach . Overall this study successfully demonstrated the capability of the CNN model for cyanobacterial bloom prediction using high temporal frequency images .
