 In this study we investigate opportunities for reducing arsenic to low levels below 1g L in produced drinking water from artificially infiltrated groundwater . We observe that rapid sand filtration is the most important treatment step for the oxidation and removal of As at water treatment plants which use artificially recharged groundwater as source . Removal of As is mainly due to As co precipitation with Feoxides which shows higher efficiency in rapid sand filter beds compared to aeration and supernatant storage . This is due to an accelerated oxidation of As to As in the filter bed which may be caused by the manganese oxides and or As oxidizing bacteria as both are found in the coating of rapid sand filter media grains by chemical analysis and taxonomic profiling of the bacterial communities . Arsenic removal does not take place in treatment steps such as granular activated carbon filtration ultrafiltration or slow sand filtration due to a lack of hydrolyzing iron in their influent and a lack of adsorption affinity between As and the filtration surfaces . Further we found that As reduction to below 1g L can be effectively achieved at water treatment plants either by treating the influent of rapid sand filters by dosing potassium permanganate in combination with ferric chloride or by treating the effluent of rapid sand filters with ferric chloride dosing only . Finally we observe that reducing the pH is an effective measure for increasing As co precipitation with Feoxides but only when the oxidized arsenic As is the predominant species in water .
