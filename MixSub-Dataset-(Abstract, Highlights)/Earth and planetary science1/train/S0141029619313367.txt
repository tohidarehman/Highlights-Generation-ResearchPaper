 As a consequence of material degradation increasing traffic loads and seismic actions a large number of existing reinforced concrete bridges are no longer safe and may represent a risk for human lives and for the robustness of the road network . Replacement of these bridges is often not practical given the cost of demolition and rebuilding in addition to the social costs of traffic interruption . As an alternative to the replacement of the entire structure the service life of a bridge can be extended by adopting reliable strengthening techniques . Among these strengthening techniques is High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete jacketing which was experimentally investigated in this research project . The mix design of HPFRC was studied with the goal of producing a material with enhanced mechanical performance as well as excellent rheology . In this study the bridge pier studied was subjected to cyclic horizontal loads both before and after strengthening up to failure . Experimental results show that the HPFRC jacketing remarkably increased the bearing capacity of the pier as well as its ductility . The jacketing also enhanced the structural response in terms of crack control which significantly governs the structural durability .

@highlight Reduced scale 1 4 bridge pier reinforced with UHPFRC jacketing was investigated.
@highlight Flexural capacity increased more than 50 with respect to the unreinforced element.
@highlight Failure was reached with appreciable displacements corresponding to 3 4 drift.
@highlight Small crack opening and low porosity of concrete enhance durability of the pier.
