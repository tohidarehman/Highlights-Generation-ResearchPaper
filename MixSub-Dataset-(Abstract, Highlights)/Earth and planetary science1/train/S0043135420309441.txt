 Evaluating the efficacy of disinfection processes to inactivate human enteric viruses is important for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases caused by exposure to those viruses via drinking water . Here we evaluated the inactivation of two representative human enteric viruses and coxsackievirus B5 by thermal or free chlorine disinfection . In addition we compared the infectivity reduction ratio of a plant virus a recently proposed novel surrogate for human enteric viruses for the assessment of virus removal by coagulationrapid sand filtration and membrane filtration with that of the two human enteric viruses to assess the suitability of PMMoV as a human enteric virus surrogate for use in thermal and free chlorine disinfection processes . Finally we examined whether conventional or enhanced viability polymerase chain reaction analysis using propidium monoazide or improved PMA with or without an enhancer could be used as alternatives to infectivity assays for evaluating virus inactivation by disinfection processes . We found that PMMoV was more resistant to heat treatment than AdV and CV suggesting that PMMoV is a potential surrogate for these two enteric viruses with regard to thermal disinfection processes . However PMMoV was much more resistant to chlorine treatment compared with AdV and CV CT value for 4 log

@highlight Inactivation of AdV CV and PMMoV by heat and free chlorine was evaluated.
@highlight PMMoV showed high resistance to heat treatment compared with AdV and CV.
@highlight PMMoV showed very high resistance to chlorine treatment compared with AdV and CV.
@highlight PMMoV is a potential enteric virus surrogate for heat but not chlorine treatment.
@highlight PMAxx Enhancer PCR analysis best estimated viral disinfection efficacy.
