 This study presents a methodology to generate probabilistic seismic demand models and hazard curves for steel frames with or without shape memory alloy bracing systems under mainshock aftershock sequences . First three post mainshock damage states were defined based on both peak inter story drift and residual drift ratios . Incremental dynamic analyses were performed considering only mainshock events to determine spectral acceleration demands corresponding to each mainshock damage level . Then aftershock IDA were conducted on the post mainshock SMRF and SMA frames at three damage states . To estimate the peak and residual drift response of SMRF and SMA braced frames subjected to a mainshock aftershock sequence empirical seismic demand models were developed . Next a risk based seismic performance evaluation study was conducted to generate seismic demand hazard curves for maximum and residual interstory displacement response . Results reveal the advantages of SMA braces in enhancing post event functionality of steel frame buildings . In addition defining damage states based on residual drifts is recommended while comparing the aftershock performance of conventional steel moment resisting frames with self centering steel buildings .
