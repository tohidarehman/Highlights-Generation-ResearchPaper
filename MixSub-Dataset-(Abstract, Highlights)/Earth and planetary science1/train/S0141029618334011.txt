 In this study a nonlinear numerical analysis is carried out to predict the creep response of reinforced concrete beams externally strengthened using carbon fiber reinforced polymer and glass fiber reinforced polymer laminates . The beams are tested under static four point bending the level of sustained service load is equal to 59 of the ultimate capacities of the un strengthened beams . The Burger rheological model is used to evaluate the flexural creep response and then to validate the findings with experimental results . It is shown that the Burger model effectively predicts the creep of CFRP bonded RC . Furthermore parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of three fiber orientations of CFRP composites the CFRP thickness and the type of FRP on the flexural creep of FRP externally retrofitted RC beams based on the Burger rheological model . According to the numerical results a major reduction in creep strain is obtained with the 45 orientation of CFRP . An increase in CFRP thickness significantly lowers the creep strain . Moreover the CFRP laminates prove to be more effective than GFRP in improving the creep response .
