 The production of biochemicals from renewables through biorefinery processes is important to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the environment . Chain elongation processes based on microbiomes have been successfully developed to produce medium chain fatty acids from organic waste streams . Yet the sustainability of chain elongation can still be improved by reducing the use of electron donors and additional chemicals . This work aimed to couple lactate production and subsequent chain elongation to decrease chemicals input such as electron donors and hydroxide for pH control in repeated batch food waste fermentation . Food waste with adjusted pH was used as substrate and fermentation proceeded without pH control . During fermentation lactate was first formed through the homolactic pathway and then converted to fatty acids mainly n butyrate and n caproate . The highest n caproate carbon selectivities mmol C mmol C

@highlight Repeated batch operation formed lactate which was elongated to n caproate.
@highlight Lactate uptake and conversion to fatty acids was observed at pH 4.5.
@highlight Hydroxide input for medium chain fatty acids production was reduced over time.
@highlight Lactate was produced by obligate homofermentative
@highlight spp.
@highlight spp. used lactate as electron donor.
