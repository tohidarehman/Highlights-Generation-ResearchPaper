 Reinforced concrete slabs constructed of precast elements and in situ concrete are commonly used for short span road bridges . The construction joints between the concrete cast at different stages reduce the torsional capacity and thus the load carrying capacity of the slab . However the present formulations for the torsional capacity based on limit analysis only consider monolithically cast slabs . In this paper the load carrying capacity of reinforced concrete slab bridges with construction joints are investigated using limit analysis of perfect plastic materials based on the lower bound theorem . New formulations for the torsional capacity of slabs with vertical construction joints and partial construction joints are presented . The load carrying capacity of slabs is calculated using finite element limit analysis based on the lower bound theorem . For the analysis a complete yield criteria for the bending moments and torsional moments are setup applying a layer model . The size of the layers is calculated from the moment capacities and the derived torsional capacities . Examples of limit analysis of slabs with and without construction joints are compared which demonstrate the reduction due to the construction joints .
