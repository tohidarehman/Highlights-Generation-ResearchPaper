 Life cycle assessment has been widely applied in the wastewater industry but inconsistencies in assumptions and methods have made it difficult for researchers and practitioners to synthesize results from across studies . This paper presents a critical review of published LCAs related to municipal wastewater management with a focus on developing systematic guidance for researchers and practitioners to conduct LCA studies to inform planning design and optimization of wastewater management and infrastructure and to support the development of new technologies to advance treatment objectives and the sustainability of wastewater management . The paper guides the reader step by step through LCA methodology to make informed decisions on i the definition of the goal and scope ii the selection of the functional unit and system boundaries iii the selection of variables to include and their sources to obtain inventories iv the selection of impact assessment methods and v the selection of an effective approach for data interpretation and communication to decision makers .
