 The provincial panel data from 2005 to 2018 in this paper classifies institutional variables into the degree of market resource allocation market openness and property rights diversification . It empirically analyzes the relationship between economic growth natural resources and institutions quality . The research results show that the resource curse proposition is valid at the provincial level in China . The low quality market resource allocation system and property rights system curbed the potential advantages of natural resources to promote economic development and caused the resource curse effect . Similarly the increase in market openness can ease the resource curse effect . Moreover in the context of the spatial agglomeration of natural resources there is a negative spatial correlation between economic growth and the resource curse effect is more severe in areas where resources are more abundant . In addition it is found that natural resource endowments will affect the quality of the system . Under the effect of the causal cycle mechanism the lower the quality of the system the more severe resource curse effect .
