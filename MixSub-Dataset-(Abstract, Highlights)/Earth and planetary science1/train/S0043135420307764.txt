 Synthetic musks are used extensively in household and personal care products and have acted significant concerns due to their environmental impacts and potential health effects . Here we present a passive sampling approach based on diffusive gradients in thin films for in situ measurement of SMs in urban wastewaters . XAD 2 binding gel which has a rapid binding rate and high elution efficiency was used in DGT device for the accumulation of six polycyclic musks and three nitro musks . The diffusion coefficients

@highlight An in situ measurement method based on diffusive gradients in thin films DGT for synthetic musks was developed
@highlight Diffusion coefficients of synthetic musks in agarose diffusive gel were reported
@highlight DGT performance was independent of multiple environmental factors
@highlight The DGT method is robust effective and highly sensitive for monitoring of synthetic musks.
