 One of the main challenges in damage detection of in service civil structures is the effect of operational and environmental changes . This paper presents a novel output only vibration based method for detection of stiffness and mass changes in shear type structures using a proposed time series analysis along with sensor clustering technique . AutoRegressive Moving Average models with eXogenous inputs are incorporated with the equations of motion written for different sensor clusters . Together with two assumptions changes in the ARMAX model coefficients are employed to build Stiffness Damage Features and Mass Damage Features . Using SDFs and MDFs existence location severity of changes i.e . stiffness reduction due to damage and changes in mass due to operational conditions can be identified separately and accurately . To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in its current form first the shear type IASC ASCE numerical benchmark problem is employed . Subsequently a laboratory scale four storey steel structure is developed and tested to study the proposed approach with experimental data . The results show that the approach can successfully identify the location and severity of damage and mass changes separately and very accurately using output only vibration data .
