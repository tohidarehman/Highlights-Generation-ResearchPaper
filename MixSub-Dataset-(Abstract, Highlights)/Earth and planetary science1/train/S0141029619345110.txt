 This paper presents an experimental behavior of unprotected W1626 steel beams subjected to localized fire . Beam specimens were either simply supported or connected to steel columns via all bolted double angle connections . Two test fires steady or transient heating were produced using a natural gas fueled burner located below the center of the beams . Thermal and structural responses of the steel beams as well as the heat release rate and applied forces were measured . The tests showed that all specimens failed by lateral torsional buckling regardless of fire loading and end support conditions . The results highlight that the heating conditions and end restraints influence the behavior of steel beams under localized fire . The experimental results presented can be used for validation of predictive models in order to improve deign methods for localized fire conditions .

@highlight Structural experiments conducted on a 6m long steel beam with variable connections and exposed to a localized fire.
@highlight The specimen tested at transient localized fire failed at higher bottom flange temperature than at steady state localized fire.
@highlight Axial restraint provided by the double angle connection resulted in lower failure temperature.
@highlight The results highlight that the heating conditions and end restraints influence the behavior of steel beams under localized fire.
