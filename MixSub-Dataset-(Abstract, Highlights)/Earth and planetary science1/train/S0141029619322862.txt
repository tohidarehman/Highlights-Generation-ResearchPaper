 Vibration based damage identification of large and complex structures requires a huge computational effort to solve an ill posed inverse problem with a large number of unknowns . Moreover due to the limited number of measurement sensors the capability to detect damage is quite limited . To mitigate these disadvantages a two stage model updating method based on the proposed novel localised damage function approach called roaming damage method is proposed . The roaming damage method has the ability to identify a wide range of damage types from large areas of low damage to individual beams which have been severely damaged . The approach can be applied to complex and refined 3D finite element models in only two steps . To enhance identification the optimization procedure is formulated in a multi objective context dependent on a spectrum driven feature that is based on the Power Mode Shapes from measured responses . Unlike conventional mode shapes PMSs contain information from the entire frequency range . The well known case study of the I 40 bridge in New Mexico is chosen to apply and further investigate this technique with the aim of testing its reliability . The simulated dynamic data obtained from random vibrations are employed to evaluate the performance of the method . Two additional features to improve the proposal the ANN enhanced PMS RMD and RDM with adaptive radius have also been explored .
