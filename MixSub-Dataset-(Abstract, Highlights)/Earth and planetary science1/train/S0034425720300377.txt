 Knowledge of snow water equivalent magnitude and spatial distribution are keys to improving snowmelt flood predictions . Since the 1980s the operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s airborne gamma radiation soil moisture and SWE survey has provided over 20 000 SWE observations to regional National Weather Service River Forecast Centers . Because the gamma SWE algorithm is based on the difference in natural gamma emission measurements from the soil between bare and snow covered conditions it requires a baseline fall SM for each flight line . The operational approach assumes the fall SM remains constant throughout that winter s SWE survey . However early winter snowmelt and rainfall events after the fall SM surveys have the potential to introduce large biases into airborne gamma SWE estimates . In this study operational airborne gamma radiation SWE measurements were improved by updating the baseline fall SM with Soil Moisture Active Passive enhanced SM measurements immediately prior to winter onset over the north central and eastern United States and southern Canada from September 2015 to April 2018 . The operational airborne gamma SM had strong agreement with the SMAP SM Pearson s correlation coefficient

@highlight The NOAA airborne gamma radiation surveys provide unique SM and SWE records.
@highlight Airborne gamma SWE estimate biases result when SM changed after fall SM surveys.
@highlight SMAP SM has the best agreement with gamma SM as compared to other SM products.
@highlight Operational gamma SWE improved by updating antecedent SM prior to freeze onset.
@highlight SMAP updated SWE showed better agreement with two independent SWE observations.
