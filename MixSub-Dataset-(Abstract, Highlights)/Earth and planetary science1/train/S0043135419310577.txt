 Halogenated aromatic disinfection byproducts are a new group of emerging DBPs identified recently . They have been detected in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluents recreational water and oil gas produced water at concentrations of ng L to g L in general . Previously studies have demonstrated that most of them can induce developmental toxicity and growth inhibition in aquatic organisms based on

@highlight Cytotoxicity of 15 aromatic DBPs was evaluated by using mammalian CHOK1 cells.
@highlight A mechanism based QSAR model was developed based on the toxicity data.
@highlight Binding interactions between DBPs and catalase play an important role in toxicity.
@highlight Three aromatic N DBPs were detected in real drinking water for the first time.
@highlight The major toxicity drivers among aromatic DBPs were identified with TIC Tox method.
