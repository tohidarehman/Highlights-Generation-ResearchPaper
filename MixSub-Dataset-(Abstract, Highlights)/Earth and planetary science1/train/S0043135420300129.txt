 This study proposed an integrated process for biogas generation and biochar production from thermal hydrolysis pretreated sludge . In this study the liquid and solids fractions of THP sludge were separately processed for the first time . The liquid fraction of THP sludge reached the biodegradability 262.65.1mL CH

@highlight Liquid fraction of THP sludge contributed major biogas production.
@highlight Solids fraction of THP sludge can be converted to more valuable biochar.
@highlight The integrated process realizes energy surplus of 0.81MWh tonne DS.
@highlight The rheological behavior of THP L was the best.
