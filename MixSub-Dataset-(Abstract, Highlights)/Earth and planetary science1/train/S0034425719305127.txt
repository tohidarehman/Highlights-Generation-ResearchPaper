 This paper presents the generation of a global burned area mapping algorithm using MODIS hotspots and near infrared reflectance within ESA s Fire cci project . The algorithm is based on a hybrid approach that combines MODIS highest resolution near infrared band and active fire information from thermal channels . The burned area is detected in two phases . In the first step pixels with a high probability of being burned are selected in order to reduce commission errors . To do that spatio temporal active fire clusters are created to determine adaptive thresholds . Finally a contextual growing approach is applied from those pixels to the neighbouring area to fully detect the burned patch and reduce omission errors . The algorithm was used to obtain a time series of global burned area dataset covering the 20012018 period . Validation based on 1200 sampled sites covering the period from 2003 to 2014 showed an average omission and commission errors of 67.1 and 54.4 . When using longer validation periods the errors were found smaller which indicates that the product is negatively influenced by temporal reporting accuracy . The inter comparison carried out with previous Fire cci versions and NASA s standard burned area product showed consistent spatial and temporal patterns . However the new algorithm estimated an average BA of 4.63 Mkm

@highlight The algorithm is capable to detect burned area at 250m.
@highlight The algorithm uses a two phase hybrid approach.
@highlight The derived product detects more global burned area than other products.
@highlight The derived product doubled burned area detection in boreal zones.
@highlight The derived product improve sensitivity to detect small fires.
