 This paper outlines a framework for facilitating the formalization of artisanal and small scale mining low tech labour intensive mineral processing and extraction in sub Saharan Africa . It identifies taxation as a potential driver for formalization across the region because the financial gains would appeal to host governments on the one hand and on the other hand it would energize ASM operators most of whom are desperate to work in a more structured and regulated environment . Experiences from Zambia where attempts have been made in recent years to control and regulate pockets of surging gold rush activity are drawn upon to debate the case for making taxation more of a centrepiece of ASM formalization programs in sub Saharan Africa .

@highlight For decades governments across sub Saharan Africa have struggled to formalize artisanal and small scale mining ASM .
@highlight Taxation could be a focal point for formalizing ASM in the region providing a win win for governments and operators.
@highlight Experiences from Zambia offer valuable inspiration on this front.
@highlight In what is referred to here as the Zambia Model the government has developed a formalization strategy for ASM.
@highlight The Zambia Model could have application in a number of countries in sub Saharan Africa with sizable ASM sectors.
