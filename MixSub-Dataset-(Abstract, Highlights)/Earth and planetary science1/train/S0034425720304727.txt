 The recent and projected investments across the world on radar satellite missions provide a great opportunity for operational radar soil moisture mapping with high spatial and temporal resolution . However there is no retrieval algorithm that can make complementary use of the multi frequency data from those missions due to the large uncertainties in observations collected by the different sensors different validity regions of the forward models and the fact that inversion algorithms have been designed for specific data sources . In this study the principle of ensemble learning was introduced to provide two general soil moisture retrieval frameworks accounting for these issues . Instead of trying to find an optimal global solution multiple soil moisture retrievals with moderate performance were first obtained using different channels and or time instances randomly selected from the available data with the retrieved ensemble of results being the final output . The ensemble retrievals taking one existing snapshot method and two multi temporal methods as the base retrieval algorithms were evaluated using a synthetic data set with the effectiveness confirmed under various uncertainty sources . An evaluation using the Fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment data set showed that the ensemble retrieval outperformed the non ensemble retrieval in most cases with a decrease of 0.004 to 0.014m
