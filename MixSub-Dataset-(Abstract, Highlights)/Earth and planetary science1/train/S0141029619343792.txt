 This paper investigates the aerodynamics of a stationary model of an interior railway carriage inside a long span truss girder bridge in a wind tunnel . Effects of principle parameters of the truss bridge girder configuration on the aerodynamics were examined including bridge wind angle of attack

@highlight Aerodynamics of a carriage and truss bridge system is investigated.
@highlight Effects of bridge on the carriage inflow are depicted as shielding and quasi Reynolds number effects.
@highlight Effects of bridge on the carriage underbody flow are manifested by suppressing effect.
@highlight Spanwise aerodynamics of the carriage inside the bridge show a lack of correlation.
