 The current study reports the community succession of different toxin and non toxin producing cyanobacteria at different stages of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and their connectivity with nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in a freshwater lake using an ecogenomics framework . Comprehensive high throughput DNA sequencing water quality parameter measurements and functional gene expressions over temporal and spatial scales were employed . Among the cyanobacterial community the lake was initially dominated by

@highlight The piccocyanobacteria cyanobium was dominant during early bloom period.
@highlight Filamentous
@highlight and
@highlight dominated during N scarcity.
@highlight Toxin producing
@highlight appeared in late August and then the dominance switched to bacterioplankton in September.
@highlight Nitrite nitrate reductase in early summer and the activation of N fixation occurred simultaneously.
@highlight The phosphorus metabolism detected a trend to initiate a nutrient starvation alert.
