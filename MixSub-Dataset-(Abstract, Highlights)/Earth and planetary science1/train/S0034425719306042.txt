 Aerosols have adverse health effects and play a significant role in the climate as well . The Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction provides Aerosol Optical Depth at high temporal and spatial resolution making it particularly useful to infer and characterize spatiotemporal variability of aerosols at a fine spatial scale for exposure assessment and health studies . However clouds and conditions of high surface reflectance result in a significant proportion of missing MAIAC AOD . To fill these gaps we present an imputation approach using deep learning with downscaling . Using a baseline autoencoder we leverage residual connections in deep neural networks to boost learning and parameter sharing to reduce overfitting and conduct bagging to reduce error variance in the imputations . Downscaled through a similar auto encoder based deep residual network Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 GMI Replay Simulation data were introduced to the network as an important gap filling feature that varies in space to be used for missingness imputations . Imputing weekly MAIAC AOD from 2000 to 2016 over California a state with considerable geographic heterogeneity our full residual network achieved mean R
