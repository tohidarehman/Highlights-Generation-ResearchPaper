 Intense pressure on water resources has led to efforts to reuse reclaimed processing wastewater for cleaning purposes in food processing plants . The milk industry produces considerable amounts of wastewater which can be used for cleaning of equipment after appropriate treatment . However due to naturally occurring microbiological contamination in raw milk the wastewater is often contaminated and therefore the reuse of reclaimed wastewater is perceived as risky . This study aims to quantify the risks of

@highlight Quantitative microbial risk assessment model was developed from raw milk to consumption.
@highlight Use of reclaimed wastewater in CIP is comparable to potable water.
@highlight Tolerable risk limits were exceeded when wastewater is not properly treated.
@highlight Contamination limits in CIP water are suggested based on tolerable risk limits.
