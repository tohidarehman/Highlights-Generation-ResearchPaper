 This work pertains to the stochastic stress based topology optimization of frame structures considering uncertainty . Specifically this paper presents an investigation of the second deviatoric stress invariant

@highlight A stochastic stress based topology optimization formulation is presented.
@highlight The J
@highlight invariant is suggested in place of von Mises stress to improve accuracy.
@highlight Expressions for the expected value of the J
@highlight invariant and sensitivities are derived.
@highlight The derived expressions facilitate gradient based optimization.
@highlight Uncertainty in both the magnitude and direction of the loading are considered.
