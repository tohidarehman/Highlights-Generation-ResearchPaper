 Handling excess sludge produced by wastewater treatment is a common problem worldwide . Due to limited space available in landfills as well as difficulties involved in using excess sludge in agriculture there is a need for alternative disposal methods . Although anaerobic digestion is widely used in processing sludge only partial energy recovery from methane and sludge volume reduction can be achieved resulting in a substantial amount of sludge remaining which needs to be disposed of . Direct incineration after sludge drying is one possible option a practice that is already in place in some cities in China . A comparison between direct incineration and conventional AD has to be made with respect to the energy balance and investment operational costs . This comparison reveals direct incineration to have the lowest energy deficit and I O costs . Therefore it is expected that direct incineration without AD will become the preferred sustainable approach to handling sludge .

@highlight Landfills and agricultural use of excess sludge is becoming increasingly constrained.
@highlight Alternative sludge disposal routes must be sought.
@highlight Anaerobic digestion AD is not a final solution for excess sludge.
@highlight Direct incineration without AD has the lowest energy deficit and I O costs.
@highlight Focus on more efficient dewatering instead of AD is recommended.
