 Organic fouling and inorganic scaling are the main hurdles for efficient operation of reverse osmosis technology in a wide range of applications . This study demonstrates dual functionality surface modification of thin film composite RO membranes to simultaneously impart anti scaling and anti fouling properties . Two different grafting approaches were adapted to functionalize the membrane surface with sulfonic groups non specific grafting of vinyl sulfonic acid via redox radical initiation polymerization and covalent bonding of hydroxylamide

@highlight Dual functional surface modification of TFC RO membranes with sulfonic groups.
@highlight Sulfonic groups simultaneously mitigate silica scaling and organic fouling.
@highlight Sulfonic group imparts high negative surface charge to hinder silica scaling.
@highlight Sulfonic groups effectively hinder bridging between organic foulant and membrane.
