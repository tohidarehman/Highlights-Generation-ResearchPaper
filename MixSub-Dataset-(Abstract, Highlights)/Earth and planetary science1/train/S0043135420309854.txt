 Serious concerns have been raised regarding antibiotic resistance genes with respect to their potential threat to human health . Wastewater treatment plants have been considered to be hotspots for ARGs . In this study high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to profile size dependent ARGs and mobile genetic elements divided by particle associated assemblages free living bacteria and cell free DNA in two full scale WWTPs and a receiving stream . The results revealed that FL ARGs were predominant in WWTPs and the receiving stream especially in the final effluent of both plants . More than 40 types of CF ARGs and CF MGEs were detected with absolute abundances ranging from 6.0 0.710

@highlight FL ARGs were more abundant than PA ARGs in the WWTPs
@highlight CF ARGs were plentiful in WWTP effluents and the receiving stream
@highlight The treatment processes can affect the fate of size fractionated ARGs
@highlight Microbial community structures and MGEs were the main drivers of size fractionated ARG propagation
