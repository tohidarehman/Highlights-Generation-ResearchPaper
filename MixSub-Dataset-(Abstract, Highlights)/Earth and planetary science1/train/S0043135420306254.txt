 Antibiotic resistance genes can survive the water treatment process . However the prevalence patterns key drivers and relationships with opportunistic pathogens of the antibiotic resistome harbored in drinking water sources remain unclear . Herein 53 drinking water samples collected across a large geographical scale in China were characterized based on ARGs mobile genetic elements bacterial communities antibiotics and opportunistic bacterial pathogens . A total of 265 unique ARGs and MGEs were detected by high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 101 genes were shared among over 50 of samples . ARG abundance was higher in rivers than in reservoirs or groundwater and ARG similarity showed a distance decay relationship at the 4000km scale . Four out of the five detected opportunistic pathogens i.e .

@highlight Antibiotic resistance genes ARGs co occurred with four opportunistic pathogens.
@highlight ARGs exhibited distance decay relationships at a large geographical scale.
@highlight Bacterial communities had marked impact on ARGs in drinking water sources.
@highlight Geographical location and sample type showed indirect effects on ARG variation.
@highlight Influencing factors of ARGs in drinking water sources were multiple and interactive.
