 Although submarine groundwater discharge comprises an insignificant proportion of the global hydrologic cycle it contributes significantly to chemical fluxes into the coastal waters due to concentrated constituents in coastal groundwater . Large nutrient loadings derived from SGD can lead to a series of environmental and ecological problems such as algal blooms resulting in water discoloration severe dissolved oxygen depletion and eventually beach closures and massive fish kills . Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between algal blooms and SGD obtained from direct measurement with seepage meters or from geo tracer based models these traditional methods are time consuming laborious and point monitoring and can hardly achieve a high spatiotemporal resolution SGD estimation which is vital in revealing the effects of SGD to algal blooms over a long period . Alternatively remote sensing methods for high spatiotemporal resolution SGD localization and quantification are applicable and effective . The temperature difference or anomaly between groundwater and coastal water extracted from satellite thermal images can be used as the indicator to localize and detect SGD especially its fresh component . In this study multi year radon samples in Tolo Harbour were used to train regression models between

@highlight Remote sensing is adapted to map fresh SGD FSGD variations for two decades.
@highlight FSGD is much higher at wet seasons and peaked in September.
@highlight FSGD favors algal blooms and increases
@highlight concentrations.
@highlight FSGD and nutrients approach highest levels 1020 days prior to each algal bloom.
