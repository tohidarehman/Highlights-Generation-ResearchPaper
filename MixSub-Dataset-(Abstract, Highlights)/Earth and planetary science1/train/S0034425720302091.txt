 The ability to map fire severity is a requirement for fire management agencies worldwide . The development of repeatable methods to produce accurate and consistent fire severity maps from satellite imagery is necessary to document fire regimes to set priorities for post fire management responses and for research applications . Machine learning techniques such as random forest have shown great promise for mapping of wildfire severity in woodland and forest ecosystems using satellite imagery . However an assessment of the properties of training data required for automated mapping with random forest is currently lacking . This study examined how training data properties affect fire severity classification across forest woodland and shrubland communities of southern Australia . The aims of this study were to examine how sample size and sample imbalance affect classification accuracy to determine whether models were transferrable across geographic regions and to assess the need for classifiers for prescribed burns and wildfires . We sampled 33 wildfires and 57 prescribed burns occurring across southern Australia between 2006 and 2019 to derive an extensive dataset

@highlight Fire severity mapping using Random Forest is sensitive to training data properties
@highlight Highest accuracy was achieved using large datasets with balanced class proportions
@highlight Model accuracy was robust to extrapolation when data was sampled over a broad area
@highlight Fire type wildfire vs burn used for training had little effect on model accuracy
@highlight Overall accuracy was very high for wildfires 88 and satisfactory for burns 68
