 The biofouling potential of three isolated dissolved organic fractions from seawater according to their molecular weights namely fractions of biopolymers humic substances and building blocks and low molecular weight compounds were characterized by assimilable organic carbon content . The AOC DOC ratio was in the order of F.LMW F.BP F.HS BB AOC DOC of seawater was 20 organic compositions of seawater were BP 6 HS BB 52 and LMW 42 LMW accounted for 70 of AOC in seawater . Their impact on SWRO biofouling in term of flux decline rate was in the order of F. LMW F.BP F.HS BB . Despite being the major organic compound in seawater HS BB showed marginal effect on biofouling . The role of indigenous BP was less critical owing to its relatively low concentration . LMW which was the major AOC contributor played a significant role in biofouling by promoting microbial growth that contributed to the build up of soluble microbial products and exopolymeric substances . Therefore seawater pretreatment shall focus on the removal of AOC rather than the removal of biopolymer .
