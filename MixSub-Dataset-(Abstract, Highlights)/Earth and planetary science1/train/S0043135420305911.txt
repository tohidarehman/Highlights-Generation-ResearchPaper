 Biochar draws increasing attention as soil amendment carbon sink slow release fertilizer and adsorbent . Herein it was interesting to find out that among 11 kinds of commercial biochar 3 of them facilitated ferrate oxidation of sulfamethoxazole . With the addition of biochar oxidation rates of 5 kinds of organic pollutants increased by 314 times and the total organic carbon removal ratio increased by 2.48 times . Radical scavenging experiment electron spin resonance analysis and probe compound oxidation experiment showed that no radical but intermediate iron species and Fe participated in the oxidation reactions . Redox active moieties on biochar interact with ferrate as electron shuttle and enhance the formation of intermediate iron species through electron transfer . The intermediate iron species not only interacted with organic pollutants and accelerated their transformation but also corrupted the physical structure of biochar and expanded its surface area and pore volume . Increase of surface area and pore volume of the spent biochar in turn resulted in the improved adsorption capacity . In addition to eliminating emerging organic pollutants ferrate biochar removed 8.7 31.6 of TOC in authentic water and decreased the formation potential of 20 kinds of chlorinated disinfection by products by 9.2 23.9 .

@highlight Biochar reacted with Fe VI with the formation of Fe IV Fe V .
@highlight Fe IV Fe V was more reactive with organic pollutants compared with Fe VI .
@highlight Biochar enhanced Fe VI oxidation of SMX CBZ CIP DCF and DEET.
@highlight Fe IV Fe V corrupted structure of biochar and facilitated the adsorption of TOC.
