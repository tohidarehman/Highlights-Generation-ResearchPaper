 The growing amount of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plant is an emerging challenge in China . The efficient anaerobic digestion of sludge filtrate generated from hydrothermally pretreated sewage sludge can promote the disposal of sewage sludge . Herein a pilot scale anaerobic baffled reactor assisted by symbionts of short chain fatty acid oxidation syntrophs and exoelectrogens was developed to improve its stability and efficiency for filtrate treatment . The results demonstrated that the symbionts of exoelectrogens and SFAS which were enriched by introduction of electrodes in the ABR system promoted the degradation of butyric propionic and acetic acids . Therefore the COD removal efficiency increased from 74.1 to 86.6 and the methane content increased from 81.5 to 92.2 with methane production rising from 241 to 282mL g COD
