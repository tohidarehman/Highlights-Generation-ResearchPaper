 The increasing use of gadolinium based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging is leading to widespread contamination of freshwater and drinking water systems . Contrary to previous assumptions that GBCAs are stable throughout the water cycle they can degrade . The stability of GBCAs depends largely on their organic ligands but also on the physicochemical conditions . There is specific concern regarding UV end of pipe water treatments which may degrade GBCAs . Degradation products in drinking water supplies can increase the risk of adverse health effects . This is of particular relevance where the raw water for drinking water production has a higher proportion of recycled wastewater . GBCAs concentrations in aquatic systems often referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium are determined using a variety of calculation methods . Where anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations are low the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty . The current COVID 19 crisis will in the short term drastically decrease the input of GBCAs to freshwater systems . Temporal variations in anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations in river water can be used to better understand river aquifer interactions and groundwater flow velocities . Collecting urine from all patients following MRI examinations could be a way forward to halt the generally increasing concentrations of Gd in drinking water systems and recover this technologically critical element .
