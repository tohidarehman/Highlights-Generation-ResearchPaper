 Worldwide it is common that the drinking water distribution systems may be subjected to changes of supply water quality due to the needs of upgrading the treatment processes or switching the source water . However the potential impacts of quality changed supply water on the stabilized ecological niches within DWDSs and the associated water quality deterioration risks were poorly documented . In the present study such transition effects caused by changing the supply water quality that resulted from destabilization of biofilm and loose deposits in DWDS were investigated by analyzing the physiochemical and microbiological characteristics of suspended particles before T

@highlight Transition effects were captured at the initial stage of upgrading treatments T
@highlight  .
@highlight Transition effects were observed as a spike of TSS ATP and inorganic elements.
@highlight Sharp differences in microbial community of suspended particles were observed between T
@highlight and T
@highlight Re stabilization established after 6 months operation of new treatments T
@highlight  .
@highlight Transition effects can be captured and assessed by monitoring the suspended particles.
