 Zero valent iron is known to be an additive in facilitating waste treatment and improving biogas production in anaerobic digestion systems . This review concentrates on the chemical cycle of iron as well as the function of the iron cycle in the removal of four kinds of pollutants organic carbon nitrogen sulphur and phosphorus which are commonly encountered in waste treatment . In recent studies the addition of ZVI to an AD system promoted the in situ production of CH
