 Experimental and numerical research studies demonstrated that the addition of fibres in correct proportions enhances the shear behaviour of Reinforced Concrete elements allowing to totally or partially replace the conventional web reinforcement . However despite of this increase of knowledge about Fibre Reinforced Concrete there is still a gap in the applicability of fibres as a shear reinforcement in certain prestressed structural elements where the use of conventional transverse reinforcement is difficult due to their manufacturing process e.g . extruded elements in dry concrete . In this context the present paper evaluates the possibility of enhancing the shear strength of Hollow Core Slabs by using Polypropylene Fibre Reinforced Concrete . HCS can be critical in shear at their end zones since these zones are disturbed regions in which the beneficial effects of the prestressing actions on the shear strength are not active yet . Five full scale HCS were tested under shear loading . Two tests were performed on each slab varying the shear span to effective depth ratio
