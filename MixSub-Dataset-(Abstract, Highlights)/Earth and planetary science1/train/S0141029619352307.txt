 Pre posterior analyses can be used to determine the value of information of inspection strategies . As such decisions can be made on whether or not it is relevant to perform inspections and to what extent this is the case before these are implemented . In this article a pre posterior analysis framework is developed for degrading structures accounting for time dependent behaviour and spatial variability . To account for the time dependent degradation a deterioration model is implemented and failure probabilities and costs are evaluated at different points in time . In relation to the spatial nature of the degradation the structure is discretized in zones and elements and spatial correlation is modelled by random fields and hyperparameters . Although the framework is generally applicable it is applied to concrete structures subjected to corrosion . First the framework is illustrated by a simple analytical example to demonstrate the calculation procedure and show how the distributions of hyperparameters and random fields in the corrosion model can be updated based on obtained inspection outcomes . More specifically the information on non inspected elements which can be extracted from measurements performed elsewhere in the structure is quantified . Finally the framework is also applied to a case study in order to prove the feasibility to optimize the timing and location of inspections in relation to the corrosion state of a bridge girder considering the VoI as a decision variable .
