 It has been widely reported that Arctic sea ice has decreased in both extent and thickness coupled with steadily rising mean annual temperatures . These trends have been particularly severe along the rock coast of southern Svalbard . Concerns have been raised over the potential for higher energy storms and longer ice free open water seasons to increase the exposure of Arctic coasts and consequently the concentration of infrastructure critical to Arctic community survival to enhanced rates of erosion . Here we present and apply innovative remote sensing monitoring and process analyses to assess the impact of recent coastal climatic changes . High resolution analyses demonstrate that the small scale 0.001m
