 Microplastics are widely spread throughout aquatic systems and water bodies . Given that water quality is one of the most important parameters in the microalgal based industry it is critical to assess the biochemical impact of short and long term exposure to MPs pollution . Here the microalga

@highlight Biochemical response to the presence of MPs was shown to be two staged.
@highlight Biomass production was severely decreased upon MPs exposure.
@highlight Longer exposure to high MPs pollution levels decreased pigments and carbohydrates.
@highlight MPs pollution has potential impact on the microalgal based industry.
