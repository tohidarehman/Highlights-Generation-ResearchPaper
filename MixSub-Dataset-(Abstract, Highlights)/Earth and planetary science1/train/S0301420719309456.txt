 Due to current consumption patterns and increasing product complexity the use of abiotic resources has been rising and has led to supply risk challenges in many countries and regions including Europe . The SCARCE method originally developed to assess criticality in Germany includes several criticality determinants that are missing from the existing European method by Pennington et al . . Specifically it i considers additional supply risk and vulnerability categories like price fluctuations long term availability and importance in future technologies ii takes a sustainability perspective by including environmental and social aspects of resource use iii enables the comparison of the European supply risk with the global supply risk . Therefore we have applied the SCARCE method to perform a criticality assessment of European resource use considering eleven supply risk categories and six vulnerability categories for 42 materials .

@highlight 42 abiotic resources including metals metalloids and fossil fuels were assessed.
@highlight The most critical materials are petroleum oils gallium and rare earths for Europe.
@highlight Tantalum cobalt and tin are the resources with the worst social performance.
@highlight Gold platinum and niobium are the resources with the worst environmental results.
