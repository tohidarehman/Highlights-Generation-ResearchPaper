 The adverse effects of diclofenac on ecosystems and human health have induced increasing interest in its elimination in environment . DCF can be removed to some extent by nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes during wastewater treatment process . However the actual roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of DCF remain unclear . In this study batch experiments were conducted to explore the biological transformation of DCF in enriched nitrifying sludge heterotrophic sludge and activated sludge systems . DCF was removed three times faster in enriched NS than in HS . Three transformation pathways of DCF in enriched NS HS and AS were proposed and compared . Hydroxylation was the crucial transformation step in the three transformation pathways . A faster hydroxylation reaction contributed to the faster removal of DCF in enriched NS . More transformation products and reaction types were observed in HS . Furthermore some TPs that were resistant to degrade in enriched NS such as DCF benzoic acid could be further transformed in HS . Accordingly enriched NS could remove DCF more rapidly while HS could further transform some TPs resistant to degrade in enriched NS . Nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes may cooperatively and rapidly eliminate not only DCF but also its TPs .
