 This study uses a new perspective to quantitatively explore the causality mechanism and intensity between investors information search behaviours and rebar market returns . Based on supply side structural reform we perform a comparative analysis of the changes in the causal relationship using the nonlinear Granger causality test and the dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model . The empirical results suggest that there is no causality from investors information search behaviours to daily returns before the supply side structural reform . However significant unidirectional nonlinear causality from investors information search behaviours to daily returns does exist after the supply side structural reform . In addition the effect of investors information search behaviours on rebar return dynamics is channelled via the continuous component of realized variance but not the jump component . Furthermore the results of the DCC GARCH model show that the effect of supply side structural reform on daily returns and realized variance has an opposite trend and conflicting features . These results indicate that supply side structural reform has a great impact on investment performance in terms of volatility forecasting and asset pricing .

@highlight Unidirectional causality runs from IISB to rebar returns variance after the SSSR.
@highlight Significant time variation in how rebar futures respond to IISB.
@highlight Greater effect of IISB observed for rebar realized variance rather than returns.
@highlight The effect of IISB on realized variance is channeled via the continuous variation.
@highlight SSSR shocks on jump and continuous variations show contrasting trends and features.
