 Taking advantage of the high mass transfer in the bulk solution of fluidized bed reactor and the benefits of simultaneous particle separation and ozone catalysis on ceramic membranes we proposed a hybrid fluidized bed reactor based on arrayed ceramic membranes coupled with powdered activated carbon for efficient catalytic ozonation . The optimum HFBR performance on a pilot scale was found at PAC addition of 3g L ozone dosage of 25mg L hydraulic retention time of 60min and auxiliary aeration strength of 5m

@highlight Coupling ACMs with PAC to an HFBR is efficient and economical for HCO.
@highlight Low residual COD and less generated bromate are found in the HFBR effluent.
@highlight The ozonation of carbonyls on PAC is influenced by the organics in the wastewater.
@highlight Addition of PAC reduces ozone demand and energy consumption for HFBR.
