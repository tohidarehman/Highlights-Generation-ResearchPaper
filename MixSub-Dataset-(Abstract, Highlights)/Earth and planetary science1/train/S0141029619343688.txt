 The paper proposes a new type of fiber reinforced polymer shear reinforcements for reinforced concrete beams . The specimens are shear reinforced with carbon fiber reinforced polymer mesh fabric configuration rather than traditional steel stirrups . The shear behaviors of the 15 concrete beams reinforced in shear with CFRP MF configuration or with without steel stirrups was investigated in this paper . The variables of the investigation include shear span depth ratio

@highlight Shear behavior of concrete beams shear reinforced by CFRP MF.
@highlight Analysis of concrete beams shear reinforced by CFRP MF.
@highlight Predictions of the specimens shear strength by shear design provisions and FEM.
