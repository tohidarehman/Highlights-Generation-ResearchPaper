 Various forms of machine learning methods have historically played a valuable role in environmental remote sensing research . With an increasing amount of big data from earth observation and rapid advances in ML increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring . Over the last decade a typical and state of the art ML framework named deep learning which is developed from the traditional neural network has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance . Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed . Therefore this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process . First the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing including land cover mapping environmental parameter retrieval data fusion and downscaling and information reconstruction and prediction will be analyzed . A typical network structure will then be introduced . Afterward the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere vegetation hydrology air and land surface temperature evapotranspiration solar radiation and ocean color are specifically reviewed . Finally challenges and future perspectives will be comprehensively analyzed and discussed .
