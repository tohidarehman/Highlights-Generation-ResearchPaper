 The impact of band selection on endmember selection is seldom explored in the analysis of hyperspectral imagery . This study incorporates the N dimensional Spectral Solid Angle band selection tool into the Spectral Spatial Endmember Extraction tool to determine a band set that can be used to better define endmembers classes used in spectral mixture analysis . The incorporation aims to define a band set that improves the spectral contrast between endmembers at each step of the spatial spectral endmember search and ultimately captures key features for discriminating spectrally similar materials . The proposed method was evaluated for lithological mapping using a hyperspectral image encompassing a range of spectrally similar mafic and ultramafic rock units . The band selected by NSSA SSEE showed a good agreement with known features of scene components identified by experts . Results showed an improvement in the selection of detailed endmembers endmembers that are similar and that can be significant for mapping . The incorporation of NSSA into SSEE was feasible because both methods are well suited for this process . NSSA is one of the few methods of band selection that is suitable for the analysis of a small number of endmembers and SSEE provides such endmember sets via spatial subsetting . The automated NSSA SSEE approach can reduce the need for field based information to guide the feature selection process .
