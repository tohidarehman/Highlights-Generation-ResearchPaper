 Ultra high performance concrete has been developed as an innovative cementitious based material . It can be used for repairing and strengthening existing reinforced concrete structures because of its excellent mechanical performance such as high tensile and compressive strengths long term durability and low permeability . However when using UHPC to strengthen existing RC structures for flexure members there is limited information on simulating existed cracks in RC structures and considering interface modeling between RC substrate and UHPC overlay . This research developed a finite element model to investigate flexural behaviors of UHPC RC composite slab with introducing existed cracks in RC substrate by geometry discontinuous approximately matched with experimental results previously published by the authors . Meanwhile based on recent research on the bond strength of UHPC to concrete a UHPC RC interfacial model was included in the FE model . The FE model was validated with experimental laboratory results previously published by the authors and a good agreement was obtained between numerical and experimental results . Finally a parameter study was conducted to investigate the strengthening effects and optimizing strengthening parameters by using the developed FE model . Results showed that the effect of existing cracks on the ultimate flexure capacity of UHPC RC can not be neglected and the interface model has a precise accuracy in FE modeling .

@highlight Damaged RC slabs strengthened with UHPC layer were modeled and verified by experiments.
@highlight Two different load patterns negative bending moment and positive bending moment.
@highlight Existed cracks in RC slab was modeled by geometry discontinuous before strengthening.
@highlight Two different interface modeling concepts adhesion and friction AASHTO and friction only ACI .
