 In this paper a numerical model to evaluate the impact of the presence of fractured rope components on the static response of ropes is presented . Specifically the proposed model couples the effects of two phenomena that rule damaged rope response strain localization and asymmetry in damage distribution . The proposed model relies on the nonlinear finite element method in which the damaged rope is discretized along its length into 3D uniaxial two noded nonlinear cable beam elements with Bernoullis kinematic hypothesis . These elements account for the helical structure of a rope as well as the axial bending axial torsional and bending torsional interactions . Experimental static tensile test data reported in the literature of homogeneous polyester ropes with overall diameters that range from 32mm to 166mm are used to validate the proposed model . Tested ropes are asymmetrically damaged on the surface of the rope cross sections in which initial damage levels vary from 5 to 15 . Comparison results indicate that the proposed model accurate predicts the static response of damaged ropes considering a wide range of rope diameter and damage level values achieving numerical robustness and computational efficiency .
