 We present an analysis for Peru of the vertical accuracy and derived geomorphological parameters of three freely available Digital Elevation Models with 30 m grid sizes and one commercially available 12 m DEM ASTER GDEM2 SRTMv3.0 ALOS World 3D and 12 m TanDEM X . Their elevation values were compared against values measured with a dual frequency Trimble 5800 Global Navigation Satellite Systems receiver with two antennas in static relative positioning . A total of 139 ground control points with elevations of up to 4334m above sea level . were obtained from four topographically contrasting regions along the flat arid coast the semi dry Andes and the Amazon rainforest . The combined results of the four areas showed that the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 had a root mean square error of 6.907m SRTM3 5.113m and AW3D30 6.246m . For the two areas where TanDEM X was investigated a RMSE of 1.666m was obtained . When considering each area individually of the three 30 m DEMs SRTM3 performed best in all areas while ASTER GDEM2 was always performing worst . The standard deviation of the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 varied much more between the four study areas than the SD of SRTM3 and TanDEM X . It was possible to establish linear correlations with R
