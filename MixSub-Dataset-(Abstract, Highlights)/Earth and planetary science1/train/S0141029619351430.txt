 This study investigates the effect of periodic overloading on the fatigue life of Reinforced Concrete beams strengthened with externally bonded Fiber Reinforced Polymers . The study includes 6 RC beams with dimensions of 152.4152.41500mm strengthened with one layer of carbon fiber sheet attached to the soffits . One strengthened beam tested monotonically to serve as a control beam and another one was tested under constant amplitude fatigue loading to serve as a reference for the fatigue testing . The rest of the beams were tested under fatigue loading with periodic overloading . The loading pattern was chosen to simulate the conditions of the traffic on bridges . Two sets of repetitive loading segments were applied with a ratio of one overloading cycles to nine base loading cycles . When compared with the reference RC beam and the available data obtained from the literature the results show that periodic overloading reduces the fatigue life of the strengthened beams . The Palmgren Miner rule of linear cumulative damage overestimates the fatigue life of the strengthened beams . In addition periodic overloading shifts the location of the failure in the strengthened beams outside the maximum moment zone . However the tested beams had the same failure mode of the reference beam which is the rupture of the primary reinforcing steel . In this study a prediction model is presented of the fatigue life of strengthened RC beams subjected to overloading based on the applied stress ranges in the primary steel .

@highlight Bridges frequently undergo cyclic loading with repeated overloading to the traffic variation.
@highlight The effect of fatigue with repeated overloading is not considered in design guidelines and research on this topic is scarce.
@highlight Repeated overloading redistributes the stress inside RC beams which changes the failure location.
@highlight The Palmgren Miner rule overestimates the life of RC beams strengthened with FRP.
