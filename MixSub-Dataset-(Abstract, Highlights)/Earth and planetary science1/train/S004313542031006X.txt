 Rainstorm events can flush large amounts of terrestrial organic rich material into lakes that are used for drinking water . To date few studies have been carried out to investigate how rainstorm events change the molecular composition bio lability and flux of upstream imported dissolved organic matter which can impact the odor and taste of drinking water as well as the efficiency of wastewater treatment . We undertook high frequency buoy monitoring and point sample collection

@highlight Rainstorm events increased the export of colored hydrophobic and aromatic DOM.
@highlight Greater relative abundance of aromatics found during floods than in low flow periods.
@highlight The loss rate of DOC in Lake Qiandao is 0.8210

@highlight Fluorescence sensors provide early warning of flood induced organic matter inputs.
