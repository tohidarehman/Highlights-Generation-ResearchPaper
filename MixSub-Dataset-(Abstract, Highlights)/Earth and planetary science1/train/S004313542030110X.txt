 Though the ozone activated carbon process has been widely applied for drinking water purification little is known about how ozone modified natural organic matter competes with micropollutants in activated carbon adsorption . In this study three natural waters and one synthetic water with highly heterogeneous NOM compositions were employed to investigate the interference of ozonated NOM with the adsorption of 2 methylisoborneol . Analysis using liquid chromatography with online carbon and UV

@highlight NOM interference behavior with MIB adsorption in ozonated waters was studied.
@highlight Ozone reduced NOM aromaticity and low molecular weight LMW NOM increased.
@highlight Lower aromaticity outweighed LMW NOM formation on MIB adsorption interference.
@highlight NOM competition could be well estimated with UV
@highlight of LMW NOM in ozonated waters.
