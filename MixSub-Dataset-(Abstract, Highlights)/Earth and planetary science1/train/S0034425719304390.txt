 Remote sensing of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence provides great potential for estimating gross primary production of terrestrial ecosystems . A strong relationship between SIF and GPP has been observed at the seasonal scale from both ground based and satellite observations . However variations of SIF due to changes in plant growth stages appear to influence the SIF GPP relationship . It remains unclear how this relationship is affected by plant growth related changes especially for C4 plants such as maize . In this study continuous

@highlight Continuous ground measurements of SIF were obtained in a maize field.
@highlight Asymmetrical response of SIF and GPP to PAR was observed under sunny days.
@highlight SIF GPP relationship varies with plant growth stage.
@highlight Canopy structure influences the SIF GPP and SIF
@highlight  LUE relationships.
