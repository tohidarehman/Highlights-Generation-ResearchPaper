 After 1991 major events such as the collapse of socialism and the transition to market economies caused land use change across the former USSR and affected forests in particular . However major land use changes may have occurred already during Soviet rule but those are largely unknown and difficult to map for large areas because 30 m Landsat data is not available prior to the 1980s . Our goal was to analyze the rates and determinants of forest cover change from 1967 to 2015 along the Latvian Russian border and to develop an object based image analysis approach to compare forest cover based on declassified Corona spy satellite images from 1967 with that derived from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images from 1989 1990 and 2014 2015 . We applied Structure from Motion photogrammetry to orthorectify and mosaic the scanned Corona images and extracted forest cover from Corona and Landsat mosaics using object based image analysis in eCognition and expert classification . In a sensitivity analysis we tested how the scale parameters for the segmentation affected the accuracy of the change maps . We analyzed forest cover and forest patterns for our full study area of 22 209km

@highlight Corona spy satellite plus Landsat data captured half a century of forest change.
@highlight Object based image analysis was robust and mapped forest change well.
@highlight Widespread agricultural abandonment and forest regrowth along the Latvia Russia border.
@highlight Abandonment rates higher during Soviet rule than after the collapse of the USSR.
@highlight Forest became substantially less fragmented over time.
