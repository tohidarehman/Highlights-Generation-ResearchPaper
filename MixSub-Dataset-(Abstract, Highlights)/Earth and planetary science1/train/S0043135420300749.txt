 In nature many microorganisms show resistance to toxic selenite by reducing selenite to non soluble and low toxic elemental selenium . Extracellular polymeric substances a high molecular weight biopolymers originated from microbial metabolism contain many reducing groups and can induce reductive transformation of pollutants . However the roles of EPS and its redox state in reductive detoxification or reduction removal of selenite respectively remain unknown yet . Herein the reduction of selenite by different sources of EPS was investigated . Selenite was proved to be reduced by EPS and partly transformed to elemental selenium . The formed elemental selenium was mainly selenium nanoparticles confirmed by transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy . The redox state of EPS governed selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation and the reduced state of EPS was in favor of selenite reduction . Dissolved oxygen concentration in water regulated EPS redox state and influenced selenite reduction . The thiols aldehyde and phenolic groups in EPS were responsible for selenite reduction . Under selenite stress EPS was capable of increasing cell survivability by enhancing microorganisms mediated selenite reduction . This work revealed the previously undiscovered roles of EPS in selenite reduction and elemental selenium formation in aquatic environments and also suggested a possible crucial role of EPS in selenium biogeochemical cycle .
