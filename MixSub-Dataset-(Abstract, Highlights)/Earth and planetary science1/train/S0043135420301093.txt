 Phosphorous recovery from wastewater will become increasingly vital in the future as terrestrial rock phosphate deposits are expended . Effective management of P as a critical resource will require new techniques to recover P from wastewater ideally in a form that can be used in agriculture as fertiliser . In this study batch and fixed bed column conditions were tested using a novel KOH deacetylated calcite chitosan based adsorbent for P removal from aqueous solutions and wastewater effluents . The unique characteristics of this adsorbent as a phosphate adsorbent were the result of rich surface functionality and the CaCO

@highlight KOH deacetylation was used to synthesise a calcite chitosan rich adsorbent.
@highlight The adsorbent showed a high adsorption capacity 21.56mgP g for P.
@highlight Inner and outer sphere complexation with CaP microprecipitation were the major adsorption mechanisms.
@highlight A desorption study indicated the adsorbents potential as a fertiliser type product.
@highlight Scale up with pilot plant design were implemented.
