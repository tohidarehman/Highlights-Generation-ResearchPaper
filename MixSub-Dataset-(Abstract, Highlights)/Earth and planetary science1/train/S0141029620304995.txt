 The design of FRP profile concrete composite sections including beams and decks is usually governed by the shear strength of the FRP profiles . However analytical methods that can precisely predict the shear capacity of the composite sections have not been well developed because there is lack of knowledge of the FRP concrete composite action and distribution of shear stress along the FRP . This paper investigates the shear behaviors of FRP concrete composite sections and develops formulae to predict the shear capacity of the composite sections . First flexural tests of three FRP concrete composite beams were conducted to investigate the shear failure mode and interface behaviors . All the beams failed in FRP shear fracture along horizontal direction . Then push out tests were used to determine the slip property for the FRP concrete interface which reveals that FRP stay in place form and steel bolts can ensure full and partial composite action respectively . Based on the experimental study closed form equations to compute the maximum shear stress are derived and validated against experimental data in this paper and literature . Finally simple yet reliable equations of shear capacity are derived and recommended for engineers to design the FRP concrete composite sections .
