 Wetting by fouling is phenomenon specific to membrane distillation and are regarded as challenges to the seawater membrane distillation process . To understand fouling and wetting the influence of Mg and Sr crystals which can potentially cause scaling as well as Ca crystals deposited on the membrane surface were investigated . Mg

@highlight Wetting in MD process using a seawater was observed by visualization system.
@highlight Wetting by Mg OH 
@highlight occurred during the MD process was firstly suggested.
@highlight Retardation of the wetting in MD process was achieved by a Mg addition to the feed.
@highlight The SrCO
@highlight scalant was formed when major components of seawater were removed.
@highlight The CaCO
@highlight and CaSO
@highlight scalants resulted in the partial and full wettings respectively.
