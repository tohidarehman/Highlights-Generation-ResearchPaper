 To avoid brittle shear failures the shear strength of reinforced concrete beams has to be verified at ultimate limit state . For this purpose simple but accurate shear design provisions or shear resistance models are required . In this paper the derivation of a simple shear design model for beams with FRP shear reinforcement is presented . At first the suitability of existing code provisions and shear resistance models is evaluated using a large databank on shear tests on members with FRP shear reinforcement . Based on the results a shear resistance model is developed based on a truss model with variable strut inclination which is also the basis of the shear design of members with steel shear reinforcement according to current Eurocode 2 . An important aspect regarding the derivation of the model is the definition of an appropriate method to determine the angle of the compression strut . For this purpose a compression field model originally developed for steel reinforced concrete beams is adopted . The proposed resistance model is validated by means of a databank evaluation . Moreover an equation to determine the minimum shear reinforcement ratio of FRP reinforced concrete members is derived based on the shear design provisions according to Eurocode 2 .
