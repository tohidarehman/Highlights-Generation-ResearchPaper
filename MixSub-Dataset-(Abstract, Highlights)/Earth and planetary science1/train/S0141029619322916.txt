 This paper presents the measurement results of bridge frequencies by a test vehicle in non moving and moving states . The self made test vehicle fitted with vibration sensors is a two wheel trailer intentionally used to simulate the theoretical single degree of freedom system . The two span bridge selected is located in the Chongqing University campus . For the purpose of comparison the bridge frequencies were firstly measured by direct deployment of vibration sensors on the bridge . The dynamic properties of the test vehicle in the non moving state including the transmissibility are examined in detail . Based on the measured car body response the contact point response of the vehicle with the bridge was calculated by a backward procedure that allows the vehicle frequency to be eliminated . It was found that the vehicle in the non moving state can catch more bridge frequencies than in the moving state . Both the car body and contact point responses agree well the results by direct measurement . But the contact point response performs better than the car body response which can be used to detect the first few frequencies of the bridge including the torsional frequency .

@highlight A self designed SDOF test vehicle was exploited for measuring bridge frequencies.
@highlight It can detect the first few frequencies of a bridge when in moving or non moving.
@highlight More bridge frequencies can be caught in non moving than in moving state.
@highlight Contact point CP response can be back calculated from vehicle response.
@highlight CP response outperforms vehicles response due to removal of vehicles frequency.
