 Hydroxylamine is a key intermediate in several biological reactions of the global nitrogen cycle . However the role of hydroxylamine in anammox is still not fully understood . In this work the impact of hydroxylamine on the metabolism of a planktonic enrichment culture of the anammox species

@highlight Ammonium is produced from hydroxylamine and hydrazine disproportionation.
@highlight Nitrite and hydroxylamine are consumed simultaneously.
@highlight NH
@highlight OH continuous feeding with NO
@highlight and NH
@highlight reduces NO
@highlight production.
@highlight Anammox microbial community is not negatively impacted by continuous NH
@highlight OH feeding.
