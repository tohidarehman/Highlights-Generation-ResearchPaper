 This study investigated the fouling and scaling behaviors in a capacitive deionization system in the presence of iron and natural organic matter . It was found that the salt adsorption capacity significantly decreased when treating Fe containing brackish water with higher Fe concentrations leading to severer SAC reduction . Raman spectroscopy X ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that Fe

@highlight Iron scaling caused a significant decrease in desalination performances of CDI.
@highlight Fe
@highlight was the predominant component of iron scale.
@highlight CDI fouled suffered from resistance increasing and capacitance losing.
@highlight NOM reduced precipitation of Fe on electrodes due to coagulation effect.
