 X ray contrast media as the most widely used intravascular pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected in various environmental compartments . ICM have attracted increasingly scientific interest owing to their role as an iodine contributor resulting in the high risk of forming toxic iodinated byproducts during water treatment . In this review we present the state of the art findings relating to the removal efficiency as well as oxidation intermediates of ICM by conventional and advanced oxidation processes . Moreover formation of specific small molecular I BPs during these processes is also summarized . Conventional oxidants and disinfectants including chlorine and chloramine NH

@highlight Reactivity formation of intermediates and I BPs for ICM reactions with HOCl and NH
@highlight Cl are reviewed.
@highlight ICM are partly oxidized by uncatalyzed O
@highlight and Fe VI but efficiently removed by catalyzed AOPs.
@highlight Conventional and advanced oxidation processes show similar reaction pathways for ICM oxidation.
@highlight Specific I BPs formed during ICM oxidation and or post disinfection are reviewed.
@highlight Impact of water matrix components on ICM oxidation and I BPs formation is summarized.
