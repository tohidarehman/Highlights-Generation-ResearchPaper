 The presence of SARS CoV 2 in the feces of infected patients and wastewater has drawn attention not only to the possibility of fecal oral transmission but also to the use of wastewater as an epidemiological tool . The COVID 19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches due to a lack of diagnostic capacity and their application to only a small proportion of the population . As in previous pandemics statistics particularly the proportion of the population infected are believed to be widely underestimated . Furthermore analysis of only clinical samples can not predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers . Threfore community scale surveillance including wastewater based epidemiology can bridge the broader community and the clinic becoming a valuable indirect epidemiological prediction tool for SARS CoV 2 and other pandemic viruses . This article summarizes current knowledge and discusses the critical factors for implementing wastewater based epidemiology of COVID 19 .

@highlight Presence of SARS CoV 2 in feces and wastewater constitutes a paradigm shift in surveillance.
@highlight WBE has potential as a surveillance and predictive tool during the COVID 19 pandemic.
@highlight Validated protocols for concentration and quantification of SARS CoV 2 and other markers are needed.
