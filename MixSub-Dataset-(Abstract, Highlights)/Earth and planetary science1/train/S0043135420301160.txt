 While flow electrode capacitive deionization one of the most popular CDI variants possesses a number of advantages over conventional fixed electrode CDI challenges remain in constructing and operating an FCDI system such that it can operate continuously . Here we achieve effective continuous removal of salt from a brackish feed stream using flowing carbon electrodes which are regenerated in a closed loop manner by using our previously introduced integrated FCDI MF strategy . The performance of the FCDI MF system is characterized over a two week period of operation with key factors influencing the desalination performance identified . Results show that the FCDI MF system is capable of continuously desalinating brackish water 2gL

@highlight FCDI was continuously operated for over 14 days.
@highlight No obvious performance deterioration was observed.
@highlight Minimum carbon oxidation occurred after prolonged cycling.
@highlight Carbon particle size reduced due to friction and high frequency collisions.
