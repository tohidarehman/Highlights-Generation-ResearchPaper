 Full scale monitoring of the Hardanger Bridge has revealed significant turbulence induced variability in the measured acceleration response . In this paper a probabilistic model is used to describe the uncertain turbulence parameters and the environmental contour method is used to investigate the long term root mean square response of the Hardanger Bridge . The results show that turbulence induced variability has a significant impact on the bridge girder section moments . It is also interesting that the critical combination of environmental parameters does not necessarily involve the maximum mean wind velocity . By using the environmental contour method to account for turbulence uncertainty the scattered acceleration RMS response measurements from the Hardanger Bridge are successfully eclipsed by 100 year return period response estimates showing vast improvements compared with the traditional design methodology . The investigations presented in this paper show that the environmental contour method can be used to improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in buffeting response calculations for long span bridge design .

@highlight Turbulence variability strongly affect the response of long span suspension bridges.
@highlight The environmental contour method ECM can describe design storms for bridges.
@highlight The ECM was able to predict the scattered full scale measured bridge response.
@highlight The ECM gave up to 60 increased design response compared with the current practice.
