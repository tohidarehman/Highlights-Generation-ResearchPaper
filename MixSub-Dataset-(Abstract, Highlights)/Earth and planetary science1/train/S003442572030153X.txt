 In this study the mechanism of channel floodplain seasonal connectivity along the Amazon River is analyzed over a full hydrological year through the use of satellite radar altimetry data . This is done via a novel observation based approach which employs the concurrent measurement of water levels

@highlight Channel floodplain connectivity process is characterized using satellite altimetry.
@highlight Decoupled channelized and overbank flows during the rising phase.
@highlight Roles of the two processes on floodplain hydrogeomorphology are highlighted.
