 The solar chlorine process is an energy efficient advanced oxidation process that can produce reactive species such as hydroxyl radical reactive chlorine species and ozone . This study investigated the process ability to detoxify the typical herbicides atrazine and mecoprop . Both herbicides are resistant to direct solar photolysis or chlorination alone but they can be degraded by the solar chlorine process effectively . Atrazine inhibited the development of

@highlight Atrazine and mecoprop are effectively transformed by solar chlorine treatment.
@highlight and ClO.
@highlight are the species primarily involved in mecoprop removal.
@highlight HO.
@highlight is the dominant species involved in atrazine removal.
@highlight The degradation simulated by modeling fits well with that by experiments.
@highlight Atrazines toxicity to
@highlight decreases in solar chlorine treatment.
