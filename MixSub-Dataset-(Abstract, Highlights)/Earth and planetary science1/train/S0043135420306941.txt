 There is growing pressure for wastewater treatment plants to mitigate the discharge of antibiotic resistant bacteria and extracellular resistance genes which requires technological innovation . Here hierarchical Bi

@highlight Nitrogen doping enhanced electron transfer and bacterial adsorption to RGO.
@highlight This improved ROS generation and ARB inactivation near photocatalytic sites.
@highlight Surface bound oxidizing species were main contributors to ARB inactivation.
@highlight eARGs released near catalytic sites were also efficiently degraded by NGWM.
