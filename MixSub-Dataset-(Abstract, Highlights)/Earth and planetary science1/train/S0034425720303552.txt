 Leaf chlorophyll content as an important indicator of photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen status has been non destructively estimated from canopy reflectance spectra in recent studies . They have also found significant canopy structure and solar angle effects on canopy reflectance spectra especially for row structured open crop canopies with varying sunlit and shaded soil backgrounds over seasonal and diurnal cycles . Since the canopy reflectance signature of crops is negligibly contaminated by shaded soil it can be inferred that LCC should be better estimated when the soil background is under shaded conditions than under sunlit conditions . However the effects of solar angle or spectral observation time and canopy structure on LCC estimation for row crops have been poorly understood . This study aimed to determine the optimal observation time and to reduce the canopy structural effect for LCC estimation over row structured crops . To achieve these goals we simulated canopy reflectance spectra covering four typical crop orientations over seasonal and diurnal cycles based on the leaf optical models coupled with canopy radiative transfer models . Moreover this study proposed the leaf area index insensitive chlorophyll index to mitigate the canopy structural effect on the LCC LICI relationship . LICI and 11 traditional vegetation indices were investigated to calibrate semi empirical LCC VI models with canopy spectral simulations . The performance of those models in LCC estimation was evaluated with experimental datasets measured from both ground and unmanned aerial vehicle platforms .

@highlight We model diurnal and seasonal effects of solar angle on crop canopy reflectance.
@highlight We develop a LAI insensitive chlorophyll index LICI for estimating canopy LCC.
@highlight A semi empirical and linear LCC LICI model is calibrated with synthetic data.
@highlight LCC is best estimated from the 15 00h spectra for north south row orientation.
