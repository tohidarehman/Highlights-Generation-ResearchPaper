 Targeted inactivation of bacteria using bacteriophages has been proposed in applications ranging from bioengineering and biofuel production to medical treatments . The ability to differentiate between desirable and undesirable organisms such as in targeting filamentous bacteria in activated sludge is a potential advantage over conventional disinfectants . Like conventional disinfectants bacteriophages exhibit non linear concentration time dynamics in achieving bacterial inactivation . However there is currently no workable model for predicting these observed non linear inactivation rates . This work considers an approach to predicting bacteriophage induced inactivation rates by utilizing classical particle aggregation theory . Bacteriophage bacteria interactions are represented as a two step process of transport by Brownian motion differential settling and shear followed by attachment . Modifying classical expressions for particle particle aggregation to include bacterial growth death and bacteriophage reproduction the model was calibrated and validated using literature data . The calibrated model captures much of the observed non linearity in inactivation rates and reasonably predicts the final host concentration . This model was shown to be most useful in systems more likely to reflect an industrial setting where the initial multiplicity of infection or MOI was 1 or greater . For systems of an initial MOI of less than 1 the model showed increased sensitivity to changes in input parameters and a less pronounced ability to reasonably predict inactivation rates .
