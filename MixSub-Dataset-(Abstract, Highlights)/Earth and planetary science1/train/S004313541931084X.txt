 Electrodeionization is membrane based desalination utilizing ion exchange membranes and ion exchange resins . By combining Electrodialysis and Ion exchanger EDI can produce ultrapure water in a continuous flow manner . Although its theoretical mechanisms are well documented there is no experimental platform that can provide microscopic details inside of the system . In this paper we present microscale EDI that can visualize
