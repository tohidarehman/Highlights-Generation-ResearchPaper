 Co digestion of food waste with sewage sludge is widely applied for waste stabilization and energy recovery around the world . However the effect of solid retention time on the microbial population dynamics metabolism and interspecies interaction have not been fully elucidated . Here the influence of SRTs on the performance of the co digestion system was investigated and state of the art genome centric metagenomic analysis was employed to uncover the dynamics and metabolic network of the key players underlying the well functioned and poorly functioned co digestion microbial communities . The results of the microbial analyses indicated that SRT largely shaped microbial community structure by enriching the syntrophic specialist

@highlight Biomarkers of well functioned and poorly functioned co digesters were pinpointed.
@highlight Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominant pathway for methane production.
@highlight This work revealed the mutual and competitive interactions in microbial community.
@highlight Niche differentiation allowed the co existence of potentially competitive microbes.
