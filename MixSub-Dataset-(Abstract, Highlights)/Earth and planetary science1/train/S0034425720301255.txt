 Interannual variability in ecosystem productivity may reveal vulnerabilities of vegetation to climate stressors . We analyzed IAV of northern hemisphere ecosystems using several remote sensing datasets including longstanding observations of the normalized difference vegetation index and more novel metrics for productivity including solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence and the near infrared reflectance of vegetation NIR

@highlight Satellite vegetation data show limited interannual agreement with tower fluxes.
@highlight Interannual agreement between satellite vegetation data is strongest during spring.
@highlight Satellite vegetation data exhibit similar interannual patterns in productivity.
@highlight High spring temperatures lead to high spring and low fall productivity.
@highlight Summer moisture is tied to higher summer productivity.
