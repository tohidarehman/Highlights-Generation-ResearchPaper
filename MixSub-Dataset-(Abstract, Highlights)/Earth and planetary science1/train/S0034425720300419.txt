 Human mediated climate change over the past century has resulted in significant impacts to global ecosystems and biodiversity including accelerating redistribution of the geographic ranges of species . In mountainous regions the transition zone from continuous closed canopy montane forests to treeless alpine tundra areas at higher elevations is commonly referred to as the alpine treeline ecotone . Globally warming climate is expected to drive ATEs upslope which could lead to negative impacts on local biodiversity and changes in ecosystem function . However existing studies rely primarily on field based data which are difficult and time consuming to collect . In this study we define an ATE detection index to automatically identify the ATE positions from 2009 to 2011 in the western United States using geospatial tools and remotely sensed datasets provided by Google Earth Engine . A binomial logistic regression model was fitted between standardized ATEI components and a binary variable of pixel status of 141 sampled Landsat pixels manually classified with high resolution imagery in Google Earth . The average model accuracy was around 0.713 and the average Kappa coefficient was approximately 0.426 based on a 100 time repeated 10 fold cross validation . Furthermore the ATEI estimated elevation is highly correlated Pearson s

@highlight An index ATEI is developed to locate Alpine Treeline Ecotones in the western U.S.
@highlight The ATEI is developed based on the image gradients of NDVI and elevation.
@highlight Sampled pixel location can be classified by the ATEI with an accuracy of 0.713.
@highlight ATEI estimated ATE elevation is highly correlated with a published field dataset.
