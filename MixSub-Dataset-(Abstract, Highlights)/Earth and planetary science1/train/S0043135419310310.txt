 Stormwater biofilters have great potential to treat stormwater for harvesting and reuse but their variable performance in pathogen removal requires further optimisation prior to widespread uptake . This paper provides the first evidence that real time control of stormwater biofilters can mitigate the impact of operational characteristics that result in poor microbial removal . We developed two RTC strategies and validated them using long term laboratory experiments utilising biofilters with a raised outlet pipe that creates a submerged zone . The first RTC strategy focuses on delivering the best water quality for harvesting and reuse or for recreational waterways . It has two components which ensure adequate treatment it retains water in the biofilter for at least two days before allowing any further inputs into the system and the input volume is restricted to the submerged zones pore volume . This strategy was effective and significantly improved water quality in the biofilter effluent . However since the system favours bypassing influent to ensure good quality effluent only 28.4 of the stormwater was treated . This still resulted in a 62.3 reduction in the influent

@highlight First attempt of real time control RTC in biofilters for stormwater harvesting.
@highlight Developed and validated two RTC strategies for microbial removal enhancement.
@highlight The effluent of RTC biofilters could meet the requirements in harvesting guidelines.
@highlight The nutrient and sediment removal was also high for both RTC strategies.
@highlight Analysed practical implication to explore RTC application in stormwater harvesting.
