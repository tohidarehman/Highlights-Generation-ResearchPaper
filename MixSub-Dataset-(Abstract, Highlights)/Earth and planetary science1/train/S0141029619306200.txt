 Non ductile reinforced concrete building frames have seismic and blast vulnerabilities due to inadequate reinforcement detailing resulting in premature failure . One option to mitigate these vulnerabilities is the installation of a retrofit system on susceptible structures . However differences in code defined performance limits depending on loading type may result in a non conservative retrofit design under multi hazard loads . This paper presents a rapid tool for multi hazard assessment and mitigation for the seismically vulnerable building frames using artificial neural network models which can rapidly generate large datasets . Using the models energy based performance limits for multi hazard loading are derived and a rapid decision making approach for the retrofit design is developed under seismic and blast loads .
