 This work presents the numerical analysis of elastoplastic contact problems of compact and thin walled metallic structures . The emphasis is on the use of higher order 1D elements with pure displacement variables and based on the Carrera Unified Formulation to capture localized effects and cross sectional distortions . Contact interactions are normal and frictionless via a node to node contact algorithm with the penalty approach for contact enforcement . The analysis considers the material nonlinearity via the von Mises constitutive law . Numerical assessments compare the CUF solutions with 3D finite element analysis concerning the solution quality computational size and analysis time . The results show the ability of 1D CUF models of accurately evaluating localized deformations and plasticity . The CUF results are in good agreement with reference 3D finite element solutions and require an order of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom and analysis time making them computationally efficient .
