 Previous studies have focused on investigating the formation of odorous by products during the chlorination of free amino acids . However studies on the formation of odorous by products during the chlorination of combined AAs which are much more abundant in natural waters than free AAs are very limited . In this study the generation of odorous aldehyde nitrile and

@highlight Combined Leucine CL produced odorous compounds during chlorination.
@highlight The yields of odorous by products from CL were less than that of free Leucine.
@highlight Species and amounts of odorous by products were allied with CL configuration.
@highlight The formation of odorous by products mostly increased with increasing Cl N ratios.
@highlight UV and UV H
@highlight decreased odorous by product via non peptide bond breaking of CL.
