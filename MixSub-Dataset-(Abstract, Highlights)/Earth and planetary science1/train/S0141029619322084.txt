 This article presents the results of a study on seismic behavior of mortise tenon joints of traditional Chinese timber frame structures reinforced with shape memory alloy wires . A monotonic tensile test and a cyclic tensile loading test of the SMA and material tests of wood were carried out . Three full scale straight tenon joints reinforced with a different number of SMA wires and one unreinforced contrast joint were subjected to low cycle reversed loading tests . Seismic behavior of joints such as failure modes hysteretic and skeleton curves bending capacities and stiffness degradation energy dissipation resetting abilities and deformation capacities were obtained . The results show that the amount of tenon pullout of joints reinforced with SMA wires is reduced . SMA wires provide continuous bending moments and stiffness during the resetting process of joints . The bending capacities and initial stiffness of the reinforced joints are improved . SMA wires provide stable energy dissipation damping performance and resetting abilities for joints and reduce residual deformation . As the number of SMA wires increases the bending capacities initial stiffness energy dissipation and self resetting abilities will be further enhanced . And there are good deformation capacities in reinforced joints .

@highlight Bending capacities and initial stiffness of joints are improved after reinforcement.
@highlight SMA provide stable energy dissipation damping performance and resetting abilities.
@highlight Seismic behavior will be further enhanced by increasing the number of SMA wires.
