 Respiratory infections from opportunistic bacterial pathogens have heightened research interests in drinking water distribution systems premise plumbing and point of use technologies . In particular biofilm growth in showerheads increases OBP content and inhalation of shower aerosols is a major exposure route for

@highlight Future use of UV LEDs in showerheads may prevent opportunistic pathogen inhalation.
@highlight Bacteria in biofilm flocs and protozoa require higher doses than planktonic forms.
@highlight Suspended bacteria may be targeted in the bulk stream with a high intensity approach.
@highlight Continuous low intensity irradiation can prevent biofilms but has not been studied.
@highlight Device design must consider bathing utility and use aspects of healthcare settings.
