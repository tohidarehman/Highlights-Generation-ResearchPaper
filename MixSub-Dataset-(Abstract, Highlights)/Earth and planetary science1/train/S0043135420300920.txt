 Streams and rivers are now recognized to be sites of intense carbon emissions yet the lack of C emission estimates that integrate beyond individual river systems has slowed their inclusion in landscape C budgets . Here we apply empirical models of

@highlight Fluvial network emissions per unit watershed area were neither related to watershed area or drainage density.
@highlight Major drivers of integrated network fluvial emissions were watershed slope and terrestrial net productivity.
@highlight Ratio between emission and downstream export of C from the landscape increases with watershed slope.
@highlight Fluvial emissions are of the same magnitude as the terrestrial C sink.
