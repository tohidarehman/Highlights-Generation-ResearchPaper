 Amazon forest leaf phenology patterns have often been inferred from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Enhanced Vegetation Index . But reliable MODIS detection of seasonal and interannual leaf phenology patterns has also been questioned and is generally not validated with field observation . Here we compare inter annual patterns of local scale upper canopy leaf phenology and demography derived from tower mounted phenocams at two upland forest sites in the Central Amazon to corresponding satellite vegetation indices retrieved from MODIS MAIAC . We focus on forest response to an unprecedented drought caused by the El Nio of 2015 16 . At both sites multi year phenocam data showed post drought shifts in leaf demography . These were consistent with MODIS MAIAC anomalies in two vegetation indices . Specifically a precocious leaf flush at both sites during the first two post drought months Feb Mar 2016 caused an anomalous decrease in flushing trees in JunJul of 2016 and an increase of trees with early mature stage leaves in Apr May Jun of 2016 . At both sites these two phenological anomalies showed up in MODIS MAIAC as respectively a strong negative anomaly in Gcc which prior work has shown to be sensitive to the abundance of leaves 0 1mo old and a strong positive anomaly in EVI which is sensitive to abundance of leaves 2 4mo age . A shift to sub optimal seasonal leaf age mix is expected to change the ecosystem scale intrinsic photosynthetic capacity for 18 month after the drought .
