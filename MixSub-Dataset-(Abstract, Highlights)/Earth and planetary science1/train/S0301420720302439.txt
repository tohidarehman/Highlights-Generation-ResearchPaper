 This study examines the role of a long standing international transparency scheme known as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in helping build trust in politicians . It presents the first known econometric investigation studying the relationship between the EITI and trust and also uses a novel instrument exploiting the variation in neighbouring countries EITI participation to control for the endogenous nature of one s own EITI involvement . The basis of this instrument reflects on a broader literature concerning the historic influence of policy borrowing in the geographical diffusion of public policies . The results show a positive relationship between countries EITI membership and trust in politicians . In particular estimates offer consistent evidence of significantly improved levels of trust among members that are compliant with the EITI s transparency standards .
