 Metalimnetic oxygen minima are observed in many lakes and reservoirs but the mechanisms behind this phenomena are not well understood . Thus we simulated the metalimnetic oxygen minimum in the Rappbode Reservoir with a well established two dimensional water quality model to systematically quantify the chain of events leading to its formation . We used high resolution measured data to calibrate the model which accurately reproduced the physical biogeochemical and ecological features of the reservoir particularly the spatial and temporal extent of the MOM . The results indicated that around 60 of the total oxygen consumption rate in the MOM layer originated from benthic processes whereas the remainder originated from pelagic processes . The occurrence of the cyanobacterium

@highlight The model accurately captured the metalimnetic oxygen minimum MOM in the reservoir.
@highlight Growth of
@highlight delayed and slightly weakened the MOM.
@highlight Both pelagic and benthic oxygen depletion cause the MOM.
@highlight Water temperature in the metalimnion is decisive for MOM formation.
