 Crop emergence date is a critical input to models of crop development and biomass accumulation . The ability to robustly detect and map emergence date using remote sensing would greatly benefit operational yield estimation and crop monitoring efforts however this has proven to be challenging . Previous remote sensing phenology algorithms showed that crop stages can typically be detected starting only around the V3 V4 vegetative stage . Furthermore traditional approaches have a strong assumption regarding the temporal evolution of plant growth and normally require a complete growth period of observations to define seasonal changes . Most approaches were not designed for within season operational mapping particularly in the early growing season . In the current paper we describe a new within season emergence approach to mapping crop green up date using satellite observations available during early growth stages . The approach was first optimized using high spatiotemporal resolution imagery from the Vegetation and Environment monitoring New MicroSatellite research mission and assessed using ground observations of early crop growth stages collected over the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center experimental fields in Beltsville MD during the 2019 growing season . Results show that early crop growth stages can be reliably detected at sub field scale about two weeks after crop emergence . The remote sensing green up dates were about 45days after crop emergence on average . Coefficients of determination R

@highlight A robust approach detected crop emergence in sub fields during early growing season.
@highlight VENS time series revealed green up events within two weeks after crop emergence.
@highlight Sentinel 2 produced similar results to VENS when observations are frequent.
@highlight HLS could be used for mapping crop emergence operationally.
