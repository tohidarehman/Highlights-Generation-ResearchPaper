 Anaerobic ammonium oxidation process has been successfully applied in the nitrogen removal from high strength wastewaters . However little information is available for its treatment of low strength wastewaters . In this study a Famine Anammox NItrogen Removal system was developed to investigate the effect of long term substrate starvation at the low nitrogen concentration . The results showed that the response of FANIR system to the starvation stress took on two phases the functional decline phase and the functional stabilization phase . Over the two phases the Nitrogen Removal Rate of anammox reactor firstly dropped sharply and then came to a constant level . The activity and settleability of Anammox Granular Sludge firstly deteriorated seriously and then stayed in a stable range . The relative abundance of Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation Bacteria firstly decreased markedly and then approached a steady state with the change of dominant genus from

@highlight Nitrogen removal capacity of FANIR system first dropped sharply then stayed stable over the starvation.
@highlight Performance of AnGS fell to a low but stable level over the starvation.
@highlight Microbial community and metabolic activity changed greatly to a different but stable state over the starvation.
@highlight Dormancy was found responsible for the deterioration but maintenance of anammox activity over the starvation.
