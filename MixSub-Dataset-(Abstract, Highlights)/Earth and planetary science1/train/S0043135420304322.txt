 This study investigated the acute impact of heavy metals on activated sludge with respect to the amount properties of biopolymers and other solvable microbiological products released from the sludge . Ten heavy metals were selected for the evaluation . Under the experimental conditions exposing activated sludge to different metals led to an increase in SMPs with a more significant increase in nitrogenous organics than in carbonaceous ones where Hg

@highlight Test 11 heavy metals on activated sludge soluable microbiological products SMPs .
@highlight Thus formed SMPs are of high biopolymer and nitrogen content and hydrophobicity.
@highlight The severity of the impact can be divided into severe medium and minor levels.
@highlight Certain genes were quantitatively identified and confirmed related to SMP formation.
@highlight The release of SMP is also influenced by the level of reactive oxygen species.
