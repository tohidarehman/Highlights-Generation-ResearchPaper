 Coastal lagoons deliver a wide range of valuable ecosystem goods and services . These ecosystems that are often maintained by direct or indirect groundwater supplies are collectively known as groundwater dependent ecosystems . The importance of groundwater supplies is greatly exacerbated in coastal Mediterranean regions where the lack of surface water and the over development of anthropogenic activities critically threaten the sustainability of coastal GDEs and associated ecosystem services .
