 With the continuous emergence of ecological crisis and resource shortage ecological efficiency has increasingly become the focus of human attention . To analyze the impact of natural resource endowment on urban ecological efficiency the study used the data of 30 provinces and cities in China from year 20062018 . The study employed super efficiency DEA model for empirical analysis . The results highlights that regional eco efficiency is low and the volatility is increasing . The regional differences are large and the zonal characteristics are apparent . The problem of resource curse does not exist in the context of eco efficiency in the area of the eastern region and the natural resource endowment does not exist . It constitutes an obstacle to the improvement of ecological efficiency . Whereas the central and western regions have a significant resource curse effect in the context of eco efficiency natural resource endowment significantly inhibits the growth of regional eco efficiency mainly manifested by natural resource endowment to human capital and other industries . The extrusion of the industry has weakened the effective play of this campaign . Finally the study concludes with some policy suggestions .
