 Biochar is widely and increasingly applied to farmlands . However it remains unclear how long term biochar addition alters the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of soil derived dissolved organic matter an important terrestrial disinfection byproduct precursor in watersheds . Here we analyzed the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of soil derived DOM and the formation and toxicity of DBP mixtures from DOM chlorination for two long term biochar addition experimental farmlands . As indicated by spectroscopic indices and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analyses 11 years of biochar addition could increase the humic like and aromatic and condensed aromatic DOM and decrease the microbial derived DOM while 5 years of biochar addition at the other site did not . The response of condensed aromatic dissolved black carbon did not increase with increasing cumulative biochar dose but appeared to be affected by biochar aging time . Despite the possible increase in aromatic DOM biochar addition neither increased the reactivity of DOM in forming trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles chloral hydrates or haloketones nor significantly increased the microtoxicity or genotoxicity of the DBP mixture . This study indicates that biochar addition in watersheds may not deteriorate the drinking water quality via the export of terrestrial DBP precursors like wildfire events .

@highlight Character and chlorine reactivity of DOM in biochar added soils were examined.
@highlight Condensed aromatics increased and microbial DOM decreased with 11 years of treatment.
@highlight Such responses were not significant for the DOM with 5 years of treatment.
@highlight Formation toxicity of disinfection byproducts of DOM chlorination were not altered.
