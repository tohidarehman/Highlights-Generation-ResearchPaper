 The behavior of shallow buried reinforced concrete box structures under the effects of airblast load is of interest . Analyzing such complicated nonlinear behavior would typically require advanced numerical computer codes and extensive computational resources . Therefore developing simplified physics based numerical approaches that could be used for expedient numerical analyses in support of design and or assessment of shallow buried RC structures is of great interest . A numerical method for the dynamic analysis of the box structure was developed based on the Single Degree of Freedom approach . The effects of the roof slabs flexural and direct shear modes of response were combined with the effects of compressive and tensile membrane actions in reinforced concrete slabs under externally applied in plane thrust on the resistance functions were addressed in the study . Soil structure interaction in terms of soil arching effect on the load distribution and reduction also were addressed . The resistance functions for each structural response mode of the structure were generated and used in the SDOF dynamic analysis and the corresponding load impulse diagrams . A rational model was proposed to incorporate varying SDOF equivalent load and mass factors in relation to the resistance function . The results were derived in the time and P I domains and were validated using available experimental data that had been obtained by other investigators .
