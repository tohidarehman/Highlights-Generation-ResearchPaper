 Mercury pollution threatens ecosystems and human health . Wastewater treatment plants play a key role in limiting Hg discharges from wastewaters to rivers and lakes but large scale studies to estimate Hg loads and discharge at national levels are scarce . We assessed the concentration flux speciation and removal of Hg in municipal wastewater throughout Switzerland by investigating 64 WWTPs in a pre study and a subset of 28 WWTPs in the main study . We also studied the behavior and pathways of Hg along the various treatment steps in a state of the art WWTP . The resulting dataset representative of industrialized countries provides an overview of current Hg concentration ranges average per capita loads and wastewater Hg inputs into surface waters . The results allowed estimation of a total Hg load in Swiss wastewater of 13030kg THg year of which 964 is retained in sewage sludge . About 4.70.5kg THg year is discharged with the treated wastewater into surface waters . This corresponds to only 1.53 of the THg load carried by the major Swiss rivers indicating that 95 of riverine Hg originates from other sources . Extrapolation to the population of Europe would yield a total amount of 11 700 kg THg year in raw wastewater with some 480 kg THg year discharged to surface waters . Monomethyl mercury on average accounted for 0.23 of THg and its fraction remained constant along the different treatment steps .
