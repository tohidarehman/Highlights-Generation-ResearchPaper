 Contemporary estimates of glacier changes are necessary to assess the impact of climate change associated hazards and water resources management . Glaciers in High Mountain Asia are mostly retreating except the Karakoram and western Kunlun Shan confirmed by remote sensing measurements . However ground validation with precise measurements of these mass balance estimates are scarce . This study selected Guliya ice cap in the western Kunlun Shan to observe its recent changes regarding surface dynamics and mass balance using ASTER DEM of 2005 and 2015 . Our findings indicate that one of the north facing glaciers surged during July and early November 2015 advancing at about 8m per day on average . The mass balance shows a balance condition 0.010.02m w.e . a

@highlight Mass balance of Guliya ice cap is stable between 2005 and 2015.
@highlight ICESat and dGPS results between 2004 and 2015 confirm these results.
@highlight A north facing glacier in Guliya ice cap surged during July and November 2015.
@highlight The surge was striking considering the nearby Aru glacier collapse in 2016.
