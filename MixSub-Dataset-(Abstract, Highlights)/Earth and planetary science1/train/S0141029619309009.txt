 The non wind induced additional nonlinear damping and stiffness of a spring suspension system would significantly influence the prediction of aeroelastic response . This study proposes a forced vibration technique to identify the non wind induced nonlinear damping and stiffness of both vertical and inclined prisms . The forced vibration pressure test was performed to observe the non wind induced pressure at first . It was observed that the pressure was remarkably affected by the amplitude of structural oscillation and the corresponding non wind induced force is thus nonlinear . A procedure is then proposed to identify the non wind induced nonlinear damping and stiffness of the prisms from the tested nonlinear forces . The results yielded by the proposed procedure in terms of a vertical prism has been verified by comparing the response predicted by the unsteady aerodynamic force with without the non wind induced nonlinearities with the measured response . Moreover the non wind induced nonlinearities of inclined prisms have been tested by using the proposed forced vibration technique which also suggests a mathematical model of the identified results for the purpose of convenience .
