 Thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the formation of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids determined based on the quantum chemical simulations were compared in this study with the experimental data generated using the differential spectroscopy approach in chlorination and chloramination . The ratios of the slopes of the correlations between DlnA

@highlight  DlnA
@highlight is linear with most of individual DBPs yields in chlor am ination.
@highlight Ratio of slopes S
@highlight  S
@highlight  for individual DBPs are linear with G

@highlight Direct halogenation of NOM by NH
@highlight Cl contribute to small fraction of DBP formation.
@highlight The activation energy of NOM reaction with NH
@highlight Cl is higher than HOCl.
@highlight Tri chlorinated HAAs and THMs are suppressed in chloramine due to trace level HOCl.
