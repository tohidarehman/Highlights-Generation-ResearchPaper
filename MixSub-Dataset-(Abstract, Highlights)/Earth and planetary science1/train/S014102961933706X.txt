 This paper proposes new brace type shear fuses connected in series . The BSF consists of a core plate two filling plates two perforated cover plates unbonding material and bolts . It is designed to dissipate seismic energy via yielding mainly under shear . Perforated cover plates make damage of the core plate visible . To analyze BSFs seven specimens were designed with different number of shear fuses tension to shear strength ratios and radii of shear fuses . In the experiments it was found that the deformation capacity had positive correlation with number of shear fuses tension to shear strength ratio and radii of shear fuses . No buckling of the core plates occurred due to the short length of specimen . Fracture modes of all the specimens were shear rupture . Contact between the lateral sides of core plate and filling plates due to flexural deformation was observed which led to significant increase of force in both tension and compression . In addition initial stiffness and yield force of BSFs were derived based on the Principle of Virtual Work . A design criterion to avoid direct contact was also proposed for design of BSFs .

@highlight A new type of high performance brace type shear fuses termed as BSF is proposed.
@highlight The cover plates were perforated making damage of the core plate detectable.
@highlight Experimental study on effects of critical design parameters is conducted.
@highlight Excellent cumulative ductility was verified by the experimental results of the proposed BSFs.
