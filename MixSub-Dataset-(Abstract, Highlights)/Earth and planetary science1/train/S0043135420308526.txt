 Nanoplastics derived from degradation of micro or macroplastics are emerging contaminants in aquatic environments where their fate and transport as well as toxicity are affected by aggregation . This study employed time resolved dynamic light scattering to investigate the aggregation kinetics of polystyrene nanoplastics in the presence of four macromolecules bovine serum albumin extracellular polymeric substance and Suwannee River humic acid in solutions containing monovalent and divalent CaCl

@highlight solution.
@highlight Stabilization of PSNPs in NaCl solution followed the order of BSA HA EPS SA.
@highlight Adsorption layer thickness and structure of macromolecules affected PSNP stability.
@highlight Higher SA and CaCl
@highlight concentrations enhanced PSNP destabilization by SA Ca
@highlight bridging.
@highlight BSA HA and EPS destabilized PSNPs in Ca
@highlight by molecular bridging and EDL compression.
