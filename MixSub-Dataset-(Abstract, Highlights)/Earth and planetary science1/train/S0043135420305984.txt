 In situ chemical oxidation has demonstrated success in remediating soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds . However its performance is often hindered in low permeability or heterogeneous media due to an inability to effectively deliver the oxidants . This field scale study investigated the novel approach of applying electrokinetics to enhance the delivery of persulfate in a low permeability media and the ability of electrical resistance heating to thermally activate the delivered persulfate . Results showed that 40 of the mass of total sulfur delivered was due to EK mechanisms demonstrating that EK has the potential to enhance oxidant delivery . ERH may have activated some of the persulfate but catalytic reactions with reduced forms of iron likely resulted in appreciable persulfate decomposition prior to ERH . Significant decreases in the aqueous concentration of CVOCs was observed before and after ERH initiation attributed to in situ transformation and physical processes . In situ transformation of CVOCs was assessed by compound specific isotope analysis of 1 2 dichloroethane samples collected after ERH application . Enrichment of

@highlight Electrokinetics enhanced the transport of persulfate through low permeability media at the field scale.
@highlight Persulfate was activated by electrical resistance heating and in situ iron in the subsurface.
