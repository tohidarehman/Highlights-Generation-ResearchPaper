 Twelve shear tests were conducted on fiber reinforced precast prestressed concrete hollow core slabs to quantify the effectiveness of polypropylene and steel fibers on shear resistance . Different volume fractions of pp fibers and steel fibers were investigated . The experimental results showed that there were moderate increases in shear strength with the use of pp fibers while substantial increases in shear resistance were observed with the use of steel fibers . In addition shear strength increased with steel fiber content . Moreover with the same steel fiber content of 0.89 specimens with high strength straight fibers exhibited superior performance in shear resistance compared to specimens using hooked steel fibers . In addition web shear failure occurred in the majority of specimens . However as steel fiber content was increased up to 0.89 in some instances failure mode shifted from web shear to flexural shear failure . In addition the 2010

@highlight Web shear failure is critical for hollow core slabs.
@highlight The use of fibers enhances shear capacity of hollow core slabs.
@highlight Brittle failure still occurs in slabs using polypropylene fibers.
@highlight Enhancement in shear strength and ductility is observed with the use of steel fibers.
@highlight The effectiveness of steel fibers is greater when used in hollow core than in beams.
