 Leaf chlorophyll is central to the exchange of carbon water and energy between the biosphere and the atmosphere and to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems . This paper presents the first spatially continuous view of terrestrial leaf chlorophyll content Chl

@highlight Global terrestrial leaf chlorophyll content maps are produced from satellite data.
@highlight A two stage radiative transfer model inversion method is used.
@highlight The algorithm was extensively validated with 248 measurements covering six biomes.
@highlight Validation results are strong R
