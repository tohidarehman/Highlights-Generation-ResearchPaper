 The Coupled Aerobic anoxic Nitrous Decomposition Operation is a two stage process for nitrogen removal and resource recovery in the first ammonia is oxidized to nitrite in an aerobic bioreactor in the second oxidation of polyhydroxyalkanoate drives reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide N

@highlight Nitrite removal as nitrous oxide was evaluated under field conditions.
@highlight Extended anaerobic anoxic phases adversely affected nitrous oxide production.
@highlight Follow on bench scale studies resolved challenges observed at pilot scale.
@highlight Optimized performance achieved with a 2 day hydraulic residence time.
