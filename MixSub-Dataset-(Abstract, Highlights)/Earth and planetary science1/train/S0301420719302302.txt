 Belt and Road Initiative provides new opportunity for China to enhance the security of natural gas but with potential challenges . The objective of this study was to scientifically assess China s natural gas investment along BRI so as to improve its investment performance . We used the super slacks based measurement of efficiency method to construct a linear programming model for NGI performance considering the resource status political situation eco tech environment social conditions market quality and international cooperation . The mean value of NGI from 2003 to 2013 was used to classify countries along BRI into three clusters namely high middle and low efficiency zones . Combined with scale of returns and the dual price analysis of input factors we put forward the improvement path of NGI in target countries in different zones .

@highlight Natural gas investment input output index system is built for efficiency evaluation.
@highlight Super slacks based measurement method for natural gas investment.
@highlight Scale of returns and dual price analysis are used for efficiency improvement.
