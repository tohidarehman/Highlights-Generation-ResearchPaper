 Region wide investigation of glacier change in High Mountain Asia marked the strongest recession in southeastern Tibetan Plateau in recent decades . However evident differences of quantitative glacier mass balance estimations on fine scales exist in the prior reports . The large uncertainties in current geodetic observations over this region highlight the need for more independent validations and investigations on the spatial variability of glacier change . This study enriched glacier MB estimates over the SETP by using the newly released global Digital Elevation Model the TanDEM X and analyzed the spatial pattern of glacier change on multi spatial scales by comparing available satellite based geodetic observations . Results reveal that the TanDEM X SRTM elevation differences which show no obvious horizontal shifts and no significant elevation dependent bias provide reliable elevation change information over this challenging area . On the regional scale the geodetic datasets achieved a highly consistent estimate of glacier MB at 4.111.52 Gt a

@highlight Multi scale spatial pattern of glacier change was analyzed from independent data.
@highlight Glacier change showed high heterogeneity related to climatic and topographic forcing.
@highlight Glaciers connected with lakes experienced markedly faster mass loss than other types.
@highlight Region wide glacier mass change can be updated from the new global TanDEM X DEM.
