 Harmful cyanobacterial blooms consisting of toxic taxa can produce a wide variety of toxins to threaten water quality ecosystem functions and services . Of greater concern was the changing patterns of cyanobacterial assemblage were not well understood due to the lack of long term monitoring data over the temporal scale . Biodiversity change in cyanobacterial community and paleoenvironmental variables over the past 170 years in Lake Chenghai were investigated based on sedimentary ancient DNA metabarcoding and traditional paleolimnological analysis . The results showed species richness and homogenization of cyanobacterial assemblage increased in the most recent decades which were synchronized with the growth of artificial fertilization and decline in precipitation . Cyanobacterial co occurrence network analysis revealed more complex interactions and weak community stability after the change point of 1987 while the rare cyanobacterial genera such as
