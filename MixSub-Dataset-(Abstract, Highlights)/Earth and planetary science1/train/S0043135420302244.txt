 Ion exchange is widely used to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater but high salt usage for resin regeneration and management of waste brine residuals increase treatment costs and add environmental burdens . Development of palladium based catalytic nitrate treatment systems for brine treatment and reuse has showed promising activity for nitrate reduction and selectivity towards the N
