 Satellite observations for the Arctic and boreal region may contain information of vegetation soil snow snowmelt and or other surface water bodies . We investigated the impacts of vegetation soil snow and surface water on empirical vegetation snow indices on a tundra ecosystem area located around Utqiavik of Alaska with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer images in 20012014 . Empirical vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index enhanced vegetation index the index of near infrared of vegetation NIR
