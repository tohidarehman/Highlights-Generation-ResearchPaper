 Within crown heterogeneity exists in multiple vegetation scenes including forest stands with heterogeneous distribution of damaged foliage . The existing radiative transfer approaches implement the within crown heterogeneity either using complicated three dimensional scenes with excessive amounts of parameters or simplifying the scenes to homogeneous cases by averaging canopy optical properties . In order to ascertain the optical response to within crown heterogeneity both efficiently and accurately we proposed a method for simulating bi directional reflectance factor of forests infected by pests based on the stochastic radiative transfer theory . Each damaged tree crown was classified into one of the three types top only damage bottom only damage and random damage . The statistical properties of such canopy structures were described with extended definitions of the stochastic moments of the SRT model including the probabilities of finding different foliage classes and the conditional pair correlation functions between healthy and damaged foliage . Field measurements and remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicle over infected Yunnan Pine

@highlight The radiation regime of heterogeneous forest canopies is modeled in a 1D form.
@highlight Considering vertical distribution of damaged foliage increases modeling accuracy.
@highlight Optical remote sensing is easier to detect spectral changes of upper parts of canopy.
@highlight Knowledge of canopy cover and understory condition helps to invert forest damage.
