 Previous research has shown that nonemulative precast walls with unbonded posttensioning can achieve superior seismic performance compared to conventional monolithic cast in place reinforced concrete walls . However the progression of significant damage and failure in nonemulative precast walls is through the yielding of ductile steel reinforcing bars followed by the crushing of concrete at the wall toes greatly limiting the ability to repair these walls after a major earthquake . In this paper a nonemulative precast wall system with replaceable external buckling restrained plates for energy dissipation and steel jackets for confinement of the concrete at the wall base is investigated through reversed cyclic lateral loading tests . Four precast wall specimens with varying cross sectional area of the BRPs and number of horizontal joints were tested and compared against a monolithic cast in place reinforced concrete wall . The precast walls exhibited no significant unrepairable tensile or compressive damage with increasing

@highlight Nonemulative precast walls were tested and compared against a cast in place wall.
@highlight Replaceable external buckling restrained plates were used for energy dissipation.
@highlight Concrete crushing at wall toes was prevented by confinement from steel jackets.
@highlight Damaged precast wall restored its original seismic capacity after being repaired.
@highlight The proposed precast walls showed excellent reparability and seismic resilience.
