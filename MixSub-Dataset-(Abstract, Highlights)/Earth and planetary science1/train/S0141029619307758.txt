 The capability of steel fibres in stress transferring across the cracked sections could be employed to enhance the concrete role in the overall load bearing capacity of Reinforced Concrete members . However the structural applications of Fibre Reinforced Concrete is limited mainly due to the poor performance of existing fibres on the market . The continuous pullout load decay i.e . softening response can not result in a major contribution of fibres to the ultimate load bearing capacity of RC members . In this paper the structural contribution of an optimised spirally deformed steel fibre engineered by the authors possessing hardening response in normal concrete is examined experimentally . To this end a structural testing programme consists of two sets of RC beams i.e . shear critical and flexure critical is designed such that the shear and flexural contribution of the spiral fibre can be assessed individually . Various experiment parameters are considered in the testing programme . The test results reveal that such a fibre could be employed as partial full replacement for conventional reinforcement in RC beams . A shear design equation for RC beams incorporating the new fibre is also proposed .
