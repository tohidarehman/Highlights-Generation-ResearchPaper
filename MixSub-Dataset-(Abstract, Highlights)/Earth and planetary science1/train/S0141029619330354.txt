 This paper presents an experimental study on the flexural fatigue behavior of the typical high speed rail profile 60E2 for five million load cycles . A resonant machine was applied to achieve a test program of different load levels with high loading frequency . This investigation focuses on the rail fatigue resistance under multiple minimum stress levels and different corrosion conditions . In comparison with historic investigations of rails for two million load cycles this new rail profile shows better fatigue behavior even for 2.5 times more load cycles . In the end a new Smith

@highlight High frequency 20Hz bending fatigue tests on UIC60 rails have been carried out.
@highlight 36 not corroded and 12 corroded rails were tested up to five million load cycles.
@highlight The fatigue resistance reduces with the increase of corrosion.
@highlight A new Smith diagram based on results of three load levels is proposed.
