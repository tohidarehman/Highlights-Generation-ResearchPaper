 Boron normally present in ground water and sea water is a vital micronutrient for plants but is also toxic in excessive amounts . Under typical conditions aqueous boron is present as boric acid H

@highlight FTIR analysis indicated B OH 
@highlight complexation with Al OH 
@highlight  s via surface hydroxyl groups.
@highlight X ray analysis showed B removal influenced by morphology of Al solid generated by EC.
@highlight Quantitative models were developed to describe B removal using Al EC.
@highlight Effects of significant Al EC operating parameters were determined for B removal.
