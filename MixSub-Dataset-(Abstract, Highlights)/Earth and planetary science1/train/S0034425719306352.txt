 Leaf area index is a key variable for characterizing crop growth conditions and estimating crop productivity . Despite continuing efforts to develop LAI estimation algorithms LAI datasets still need improvement at spatial and temporal resolutions to meet the requirements of agricultural applications . Advancements in data fusion technique and the emergence of new satellite data provide opportunities for LAI data at higher resolutions in both space and time . In this study we derived new LAI estimations by leveraging novel satellite remote sensing datasets STAIR fusion and Planet Labs CubeSat data for a typical agricultural landscape in the U.S. Corn Belt . The STAIR fused data and our reprocessed CubeSat data have both fine spatial resolutions and high frequencies . To reliably estimate LAI from these advanced satellite datasets we used two methods inversion of a radiative transfer model and empirical relationship with vegetation index calibrated from field measured LAI . Compared to the ground truth LAI collected at 36 sites across the study region reliable approximations were achieved by both LAI estimations based on PROSAIL RTM STAIR R

@highlight High spatiotemporal resolution LAI is achieved from MODIS Landsat Fusion and CubeSat.
@highlight Both empirical and process based LAI estimations achieve high performance.
@highlight The MODIS and VIIRS LAI products show large bias for cropland.
