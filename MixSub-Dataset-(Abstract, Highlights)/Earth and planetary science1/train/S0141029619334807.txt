 Base isolation is an efficient strategy for protecting structures especially in countries with high seismic risk such as Chile . This paper presents the conceptual model mathematical model experimental validation and numerical analysis of a roller type base isolation device that aims to solve problems of limited tensile strength and lateral instability of all types of rubber bearing isolators when faced with elevated axial load . The conceptual model describes the devices components and operation . The mathematical model establishes its constitutive law based on the equilibrium equations formulated considering large lateral displacements . Experimental tests were run on a shake table with a load frame to simulate the isolators interaction with the superstructure considering a combination of the devices design parameters in order to identify their effect . In the numerical analysis six simple frame buildings were modelled and subjected to a seismic record using the proposed roller isolator . Error parameters were obtained between the numerical predictions and the experimental results in each loading and unloading cycle varying between 1.6 and 5.1 for dissipated energy and 4.0 to 17.7 for the magnitude of force . The proposed device worked as a seismic isolator reducing the structures response in a magnitude order in relation to the building fixed on its base .
