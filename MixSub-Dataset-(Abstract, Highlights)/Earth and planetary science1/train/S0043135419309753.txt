 Dissolved organic matter in groundwater is fundamentally important with respect to biogeochemical reactions global carbon cycling heavy metal transport water treatability and potability . One source of DOM to groundwater is from the transport of organic matter from the vadose zone by rainfall recharge . Changes in precipitation patterns associated with natural climate variability and climate change are expected to alter the load and character of organic matter released from these areas which ultimately impacts on groundwater quality and DOM treatability . In order to investigate potential changes in groundwater DOM character after rainfall recharge we sampled shallow groundwater from a coastal peat rich sand aquifer in New South Wales Australia during an extended period of low precipitation average daily precipitation rate 1.6mm day

@highlight We assess changes in groundwater DOM pre and post rainfall using LC OCD and FT ICR MS.
@highlight We identify the leaching of sedimentary organic carbon into groundwater post rainfall.
@highlight Periods of low precipitation can lead to low hydrophilic hydrophobic organic carbon ratios in groundwater.
@highlight We identify the preferential adsorption of aromatic hydrophobic organic matter after rainfall.
@highlight Increased coastal rainfall may make water treatment more difficult and expensive in the future.
