 In order to study the crack development of CFRP reinforced coral concrete under different bending conditions experimental study investigation of crack width of steel and CFRP reinforced coral concrete beams were performed . A comparative study of cracking rate maximum crack height and crack patterns in CFRP bars reinforced coral concrete beams at different stages is made with ordinary steel reinforced coral concrete beams . The results show that under similar reinforcement ratio the crack width and crack spacing of CFRP reinforced coral concrete beams are larger than that of steel reinforced concrete beams increasing the reinforcement ratio of test beams can effectively reduce the crack width . The current deign formula from existing design codes overestimates the value of the relative bond characteristic coefficient

@highlight A new type of CFRP Bars reinforced Coral Concrete was developed 
@highlight Test was performed the mechanical property of this type of structure was studied 
@highlight Crack development process for this type of new structure is discovered.
@highlight A new formula to predict the crack width of this new type structure is developed.
