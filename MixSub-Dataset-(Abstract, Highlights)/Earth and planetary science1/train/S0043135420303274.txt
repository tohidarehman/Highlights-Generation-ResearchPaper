 The potential benefits of reclaimed water uses for environmental enhancement and restoration could become adverse impacts if RW does not meet the quality criteria that ensure wildlife preservation . RW can contain complex mixtures of micropollutants that may accumulate in sediment after environmental uses and affect benthic fauna . Therefore we designed this study to assess the effects of RW on a sediment insect species used mainly in ecotoxicology

@highlight Twenty of the 23 pollutants screened in reclaimed water were detected.
@highlight Carbamazepine and triclosan accumulated in sediment at realistic concentrations.
@highlight Reclaimed water produced significant effects only in molecular terms.
@highlight The most marked increase in
@highlight expression was observed for the binary RW fortification.
@highlight Synergisms between reclaimed water and other pollutants may be of major concern.
