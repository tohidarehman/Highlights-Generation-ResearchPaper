 This paper presents a probabilistic assessment on the time dependent mechanical behavior of post tensioned self centering concrete connections . First the prestress loss in PTSC frames induced by the shrinkage and creep effects of concrete is estimated according to the probabilistic analysis with the inclusion of possible sources of uncertainties . The finite element models of PTSC subassemblies with different structural parameters are developed and utilized to investigate the impacts of span number reinforcement ratio and initial prestress level on the loss degree of prestress . Subsequently a time dependent analytical model is proposed for the PTSC concrete connections . The long term performance of PTSC joints is analyzed with the incorporation of prestress loss and other time dependent effects such as the continuing hydration of cement . Finally the key indicators for the mechanical properties of PTSC connections are extracted and quantitatively evaluated .
