 In order to prevent corrosion damage steel structures need to be protected . Coating systems achieve this by the isolation of the steel from its environment . Common binding agents are epoxide and polyurethane resins which harden by polyaddition reactions . In contact with water various organic substances might be leached out and released into the aquatic environment potentially causing adverse effects . So far no legal requirements are mandatory for the environmental sustainability of coating systems . To characterize emissions from steel coatings recommendations for the ecotoxicological assessment of construction products were utilized . Seven different coating systems based on epoxide or polyurethane resins were leached in 8 steps followed by the testing of acute toxic effects on bacteria and algae as well as estrogen like and mutagenic effects . In addition chemical analysis by GC MS was performed to identify potentially toxic compounds released from the coating systems . Two systems tested did not show any significant effects in the bioassays . One coating system caused significant algal toxicity none was found to cause mutagenic effects . The other coating systems mainly showed estrogenic effects and bacterial toxicity . The effects increased with increasing leaching time . 4

@highlight Anti corrosion coatings can cause high bacterial toxicity and estrogenic effects.
@highlight 4 
@highlight  butylphenol was identified as main contributor to acute and toxic effects.
@highlight Emission is controlled by the underlying release mechanism rather than concentration.
@highlight Coatings based on polyurethane resin were less harmful than epoxide resin based.
@highlight Proposal for an efficient assessment of coating systems based on the DIBt concept.
