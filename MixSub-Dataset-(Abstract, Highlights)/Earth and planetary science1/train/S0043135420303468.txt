 Eliminating pharmaceutical active compounds from source separated urine is essential for nutrient recovery and reducing the contaminant load to wastewater treatment plants . However limited oxidation treatment processes have shown satisfactory performance due to strong scavenging effect of urine components . This study proposed a heterogeneous catalytic system by combining biochar with peroxydisulfate which effectively removed sulfamethoxazole and its major human metabolite

@highlight Urine components accelerated the activation of persulfate by biochar.
@highlight Sulfonamide competed with persulfate for biochar active sites.
@highlight Different mechanisms dominated biochar suspension and biochar packed column systems.
@highlight Antimicrobial effects were eliminated after the treatment by biochar persulfate.
