 The water quality prediction performance of machine learning models may be not only dependent on the models but also dependent on the parameters in data set chosen for training the learning models . Moreover the key water parameters should also be identified by the learning models in order to further reduce prediction costs and improve prediction efficiency . Here we endeavored for the first time to compare the water quality prediction performance of 10 learning models using big data from the major rivers and lakes in China from 2012 to 2018 based on the precision recall F1 score weighted F1 score and explore the potential key water parameters for future model prediction . Our results showed that the bigger data could improve the performance of learning models in prediction of water quality . Compared to other 7 models decision tree random forest and deep cascade forest trained by data sets of pH DO CODMn and NH
