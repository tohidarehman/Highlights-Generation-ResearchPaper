 Biofouling is a key problem in membrane filtration and extracellular polymer substances play a key role in biofouling . Biofouling contributes to membrane fouling during ultrafiltration of up flow biological activated carbon filter effluent . EPS are released when pollutants get attached with membrane surface and when pollutants are in solution phase from cell lysis and by cell secretions . In our study of EPS humic acid prepared as the effluent pollutants for ultrafiltration we found that EPS increased the interfacial forces between the pollutants and the membrane resulting in membrane fouling . In the early stages of filtration the main contribution of EPS to membrane fouling was to bond with organic colloids which led to an increase in the pollutant particle size and zeta potential . This increased the short range Lewis acid base forces from 4.89 nN to 12.59 nN and accelerated the formation of a cake layer . In the late stage of filtration the EPS increased both the AB and Londonvan der Waals forces thus accelerating membrane fouling . In order to mitigate biofouling we developed a method of pretreating the effluent with 0.4mg L ozone prior to ultrafiltration and backwashing with 8mg L H
