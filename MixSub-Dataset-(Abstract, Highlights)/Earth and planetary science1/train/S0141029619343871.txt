 The main objective of this paper is to understand and characterize the level of expected earthquake induced economic losses of steel buildings designed to Eurocode 8 . This is attained through the use of a comprehensive population of case study buildings that considers different lateral load resisting systems plan configurations and building heights . Different locations of low and high seismicity reflecting the majority of the European seismic reality are considered . The results indicate that EC8 compliant steel moment resisting frame buildings and concentrically braced frame buildings generally exhibit good seismic performance in terms of mean annual frequency of reaching collapse . Although all buildings showed good performance against collapse when compared to the requirements present in literature clear indications on a lower performance of chevron braced CBFs are observed . Furthermore low expected annual losses are recorded across the population of steel buildings considered with a predominant contribution of losses coming from structural and non structural damage . Based on the findings reported in this paper different insights towards the incorporation of loss performance objectives in the European seismic design code are provided .

@highlight The seismic performance of EC8 compliant steel MRF and CBF buildings is examined.
@highlight The need for revisions of EC8 towards better seismic performance is emphasized.
@highlight Contributions towards the use of loss driven seismic designs in EC8 are detailed.
