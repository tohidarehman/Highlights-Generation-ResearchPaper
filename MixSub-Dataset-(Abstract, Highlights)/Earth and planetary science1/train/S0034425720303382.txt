 The history of Earth observation from space is well reflected through the Landsat program . With data collection beginning with Landsat 1 in 1972 the program has evolved technical capabilities while maintaining continuity of land observations . In so doing Landsat has provided a critical reference for assessing long term changes to Earth s land environment due to both natural and human forcing . Poised for launch in mid 2021 the joint NASA USGS Landsat 9 mission will continue this important data record . In many respects Landsat 9 is a clone of Landsat 8 . The Operational Land Imager 2 is largely identical to Landsat 8 OLI providing calibrated imagery covering the solar reflected wavelengths . The Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 improves upon Landsat 8 TIRS addressing known issues including stray light incursion and a malfunction of the instrument scene select mirror . In addition Landsat 9 adds redundancy to TIRS 2 thus upgrading the instrument to a 5 year design life commensurate with other elements of the mission . Initial performance testing of OLI 2 and TIRS 2 indicate that the instruments are of excellent quality and expected to match or improve on Landsat 8 data quality . Landsat 9 will maintain the current data acquisition rate of up to 740 scenes per day with these scenes available from the Landsat archive at no cost to users . In this communication we provide background and rationale for the Landsat 9 mission describe the instrument payloads and ground system and discuss data products available from the Landsat 9 mission through USGS .

@highlight The Landsat 9 mission will continue and improve on the capabilities of Landsat 8.
@highlight Performance of OLI 2 and TIRS 2 instruments appears to be excellent.
@highlight USGS will provide standard surface reflectance and temperature products.
@highlight Surface temperature will initially be derived via single channel algorithm.
