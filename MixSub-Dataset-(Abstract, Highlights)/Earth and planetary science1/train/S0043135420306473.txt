 The environmental impact of uranium released during nuclear power production and related mining activity is an issue of great concern . Innovative environmental friendly water remediation strategies like those based on U biomineralization through phosphatase activity are desirable . Here we report the great U biomineralization potential of

@highlight Bacterial strain
@highlight sp. Br8 mediates soluble U VI immobilization.
@highlight Uranium immobilization process is stable under changing environmental conditions.
@highlight Main Br8 uranium interaction mechanisms are linked to phosphatase enzymes.
@highlight U phosphate phases presented a local coordination similar to that of autunite groups.
