 Hydroxylamine showed an outstanding performance on enhancing the oxidation of pollutants in Fe involved advanced oxidation processes while the detailed reaction schemes have not been fully revealed . Specific functions of hydroxylamine in the oxidation of benzoic acid with Fe persulfate system were explored . With the addition of hydroxylamine degradation kinetics of benzoic acid deviated from both two stage kinetics and pseudo first order kinetics but could be interpreted well with binomial regression analysis . Degradation rate constant

@highlight Kinetic variations were compared in Fe II persulfate system with and without hydroxylamine.
@highlight Kinetic models with fast equilibrium of hydroxylamine and Fe III were built to simulate degradation process.
@highlight Fast equilibrium of hydroxylamine and Fe III was a dominant factor for the enhanced oxidation of pollutants.
