 The incremental harmonic balance method is popularly used in the nonlinear analysis of dynamic systems . It is however only applicable to polynomial type geometrical nonlinearity which greatly limits its application to more general nonlinear systems . The IHB method is extended in this report to overcome this limitation with a simple procedure for evaluating the stiffness matrix . The EIHB is versatile in dealing with any type of continuous nonlinear functions including the piecewise linear function and hysteretic restoring force function . Several nonlinear Single Degree of Freedom systems are adopted for illustration of the proposed method . One more simple 7 DoFs suspension bridge deck and one more complicated 48 Dofs frame structure with buckling restrained braces are analyzed . New observations are noted from the analysis which would otherwise be difficult to obtain via existing methods . The proposed method is concluded to be simpler and convenient for nonlinear dynamic analysis of complicated structural system than existing methods .
