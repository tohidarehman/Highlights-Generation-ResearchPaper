 The functional diversity of two planktonic functional compartments the nano microphytoplankton and the mesozooplankton was used in order to better understand i the drained marshes functioning and their related ecological functions ii the impacts of human control and human activities on the catchment basin . It was based on a monthly seasonal survey on 7 freshwater drained marshes .

@highlight Polder areas needs a better hnowledge of how human impacts act on them.
@highlight A functional diversity approach of two planktonic functional compartments.
@highlight The artificial summer replenishment decreased the eutrophication processes.
@highlight The catchment basins size may lead to summer eutrophication via several processes.
@highlight Urbanized marshes are less subjected to eutrophication during summer.
