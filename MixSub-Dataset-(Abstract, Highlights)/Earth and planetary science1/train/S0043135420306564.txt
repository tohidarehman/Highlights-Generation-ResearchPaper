 Fluidized bed reactor Fenton process was adopted for reverse osmosis concentrate treatment with three types of carriers including sand zeolite and granular activated carbon . Adsorption studies demonstrated that GAC achieved the best adsorption performance among the three carriers and the adsorption of ROC organic matters followed a two stage adsorption model . Fenton oxidations were carried out in three fluidized beds after column saturation and FBR Fenton GAC process achieved highest COD removal and most BOD

@highlight GAC is the best carrier for organics removal and total iron removal in ROC treatment.
@highlight Continuous in situ GAC regeneration is observed in FBR Fenton GAC process.
@highlight Fenton reaction GAC adsorption and GAC H
@highlight contribute to organics removal in ROC.
