 Assays based on the polymerase chain reaction are widely applied to quantify enteric viruses in aquatic environments to study their fates and potential infection risks . However inhibitory substances enriched by virus concentration processes can result in inaccurate quantification . This study aimed to find a method for improving virus quantification by mitigating the effects of inhibitory environmental concentrates using previous knowledge of the properties of the inhibitory substances . Performances of anion exchange resins gel filtration and a hydrophobic resin were comparatively evaluated using poliovirus and its extracted RNA spiked into humic acid solutions . These solutions served as good representatives of the inhibitory environmental concentrates . A sequential treatment using DAX 8 resin and gel filtration produced the most favorable results i.e . low virus losses that were stable and a reduced inhibitory effect . Furthermore the sequential treatment was applied to another set of 15 environmental concentrates . Without the sequential treatment serious underestimation 4.0 log

@highlight Some organic substances hinder virus detection after concentration processes.
@highlight Various treatments to mitigate these inhibitory effects were tested.
@highlight Performance of a treatment using DAX 8 resin with gel filtration was satisfactory.
@highlight The treatment improved the quantification of variable viruses in environmental samples.
