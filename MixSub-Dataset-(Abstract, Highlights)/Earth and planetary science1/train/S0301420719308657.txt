 To examine the spillover effects of crude oil price and clean energy metal prices we first explore the Granger causality between crude oil and clean energy metals prices . Then we decompose crude oil price returns into a high frequency sequence a low frequency sequence and a trend residual using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition model . Lastly a VAR model is used to study the spillover effects of crude oil price on seven types of clean energy metal prices . The results show that crude oil price has non linear Granger causality with lithium cobalt manganese antimony cadmium molybdenum and tellurium . And crude oil price has a significant positive spillover effect on seven types of clean energy metals at different time scales . Specifically the crude oil original sequence Oil HF Oil LF and Oil res all have fluctuation effects on the cobalt and molybdenum markets . The spillover effects of the crude oil market on the lithium manganese antimony and cadmium markets are caused by the low frequency sequence . The trend in crude oil price returns has a great effect on tellurium price while the spillover effects of crude oil price Oil HF and Oil LF on tellurium are weak positive .

@highlight The spillover effects across the crude oil and clean energy metal markets are examined.
@highlight The empirical analysis is from a multi scale perspective.
@highlight Crude oil price returns have spillover effects on seven types of clean energy metal prices.
@highlight The spillover effects of crude oil price returns on clean energy metal prices can be distinct in different timescale.
