 Under strong seismic excitation the resonance frequencies of civil engineering structures rapidly decrease followed by slow recovery back to their initial values if there is no damage . In this study we show that as for laboratory trials with rock samples the properties of the slow recovery characterise the level of heterogeneities and in this case the damage rate . First we validate this concept with laboratory tests applied to continuous beam like structures in damaged and undamaged states . One recent model is used to fit the observed recoveries and we show that its parameters change with the health of the equivalent structure . In a second step this concept is applied to two civil engineering structures that experience earthquakes the first without observed damage and the second that experienced a fore main after shock sequence with apparent damage that was characterised by a permanent drop in resonance frequency . The efficiency of the proposed model is confirmed for monitoring and for the fit of the frequency recovery . We conclude that the recovery process is a clear proxy of the structural state and that this could be helpful for seismic monitoring of structural health during earthquake sequences .
