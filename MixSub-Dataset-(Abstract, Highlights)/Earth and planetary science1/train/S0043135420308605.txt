 The increasing application of plastics is accompanied by increasing concern over the stability and potential risk of nanoplastics . Heteroaggregation with metal based nanoparticles e.g . CeO

@highlight The presence of CeO
@highlight NPs aggravated the aggregation of polystyrene nanoplastics.
@highlight Surface coatings affected the interaction patterns between PS NPs and CeO
@highlight NPs.
@highlight NOMs played a role in the heteroaggrergation of PS NPs with CeO
@highlight NPs in sea water.
@highlight High anion levels induced a fast heteroaggreagtion of PS NH
@highlight and CeO
@highlight NPs.
