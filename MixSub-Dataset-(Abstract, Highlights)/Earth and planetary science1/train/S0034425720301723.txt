 Automatically monitoring newly constructed building areas is essential for efficient land resource management and sustainable urban development particularly in the rapidly urbanizing country of China . In this regard time series multi view high resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details for clearly characterizing NCBAs but this leads to great heterogeneity and complexity owing to the high spectral variation complicated imaging conditions and different viewing angles . Moreover to date the vertical features and time series information from these images have not been fully exploited for urban change detection . In this paper our primary objective is to automatically detect the presence of NCBAs and meanwhile to investigate the feasibility of identifying their change timing using time series multi view ZY 3 high resolution satellite images . To this aim we propose an automatic change detection method consisting of three components 1 firstly we jointly use planar vertical features to delineate the NCBAs 2 object based temporal correction is subsequently applied to improve the spatiotemporal consistency of the features and 3 finally a multi temporal change detection model is used to simultaneously capture the NCBAs and the change timing . We applied the method on two urban fringe areas of Beijing and Shanghai respectively which are cities that have been experiencing rapid urbanization . The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method . For both study areas the F score values reached nearly 90 in terms of NCBA detection and with respect to the change timing the overall accuracies with a one year tolerance strategy reached around 92 . The joint use of the planar vertical features and the inclusion of multi temporal images make the proposed method a promising approach for automatically providing the spatiotemporal information of NCBAs in practical applications .
