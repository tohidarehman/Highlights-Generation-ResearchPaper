 Antibiotic resistome is a raising concern around the world especially considering treated wastewater for reclamation . A wastewater reclamation system composed by a treatment system and a reclaimed system with supplementation from the treated effluent and considered as an integrated system of treatment and reclamation was selected in this study . High throughput qPCR was applied to profile 283 antibiotic resistance genes and 12 mobile genetic elements in the WWRS . A total of 251 ARG and 12 MGE subtypes were detected in the WWRS . The TS exhibited good performance for the removal of ARGs with the number relative and absolute abundances of ARGs largely decreased in the final effluent which might be ascribed to biosolid sedimentation . Enhancement of biosolids removal contributed the lessening of ARGs . In the RS high quality effluent significantly reduced the number and abundance of ARGs along the flow to downstream . MGEs were less reduced in the treated effluent than that of the influent R

@highlight ARGs and MGEs could be effectively removed in the eco biological treatment system.
@highlight High quality reclaimed wastewater could lessen the abundance of ARGs in the water samples of reclaimed system.
@highlight The number and relative abundances of MGEs were less reduced in the treated effluent than that in the influent.
@highlight Bacterial communities were significantly correlated with ARGs in the wastewater reclamation system.
