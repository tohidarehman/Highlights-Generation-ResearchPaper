 Aiming to expand the structural applications of recycled aggregate concrete the innovative approach of using the hybrid form of RAC filled glass fiber reinforced polymer steel composite tube columns is particularly striking because of their optimal combining of fiber reinforced polymer RAC and steel . The existing research relevant to RACFCTs is limited and is mainly concerned with seismic performance . This paper presents the first ever axial compression test on RACFCTs having three different slenderness ratios ranging from 20 to 40 the effect of the recycled coarse aggregate replacement ratio is also examined . The main performance aspects evaluated in this study were the failure mode ultimate condition axial loadlateral deflection curves loadstrain curves and dilation behavior . The test results clearly show the benefit of the GFRPsteel composite tube on the compression behavior of the columns . The test results also demonstrate that the RACFCTs with a high RA replacement ratio and a high slenderness ratio had more ductile behavior . Finally a design equation for predicting the maximum capacity of RACFCTs was derived and its applicability was examined . The proposed formula produced a close estimate of the test results .

@highlight A sustainable form of a hybrid column containing structural recycled aggregate concrete was developed.
@highlight The failure mode ultimate load load deformation curve and stressstrain curve were discussed.
@highlight The influence of confinement RA replacement ratios and three slenderness ratios was discussed.
@highlight A theoretical equation was proposed for predicting the ultimate bearing capacity of RACFCTs.
