 F specific coliphages have been proposed as viral indicators of fecal pollution . These intestinal phages infect cells through the F pili of the host strains used for their detection

@highlight A new Bluephage approach is now available for F specific coliphages.
@highlight The optimal performance was obtained with a derivative of strain
@highlight HS.
@highlight The Bluephage approach for F specific coliphages can be adapted to quantitative analysis.
@highlight Changes in incubation time and conditions improves the detection of F specific coliphages.
