 Seasonal freeze thaw affects over half the northern hemisphere and impacts many key processes of the Earth System such as energy exchange hydrology and vegetation . Nearly all past studies using spaceborne FT retrievals have focused on characterizing FT specifically for natural environments . FT in the built environment is also routinely studied and a topic of great interest especially with regards to transportation infrastructure . Whereas natural FT process are frequently investigated using spaceborne observations FT studies of roads are often limited to local scales using in situ or nearby weather station data only . Comparisons between FT retrievals obtained from NASA s Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite and roads in Alaska and the Contiguous United States showed that spaceborne FT retrievals had good agreement with road data . But those results also indicated that NASA FT retrievals in CONUS were relatively too warm compared to road data . If SMAP FT retrievals were to be used for identifying FT transition timing for applications by the transportation community it is also important for frozen conditions to be identified more accurately . This work is primarily concerned with improving frozen retrievals made in CONUS by calculating new Normalized Polarization Ratio thresholds as compared to those currently used in SMAP FT. We found that focusing on a temporal subset of October through May for comparisons greatly improved the correlation between NPR and effective soil temperature T
