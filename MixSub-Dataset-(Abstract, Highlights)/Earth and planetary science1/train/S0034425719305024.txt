 The drainage divides of ice sheets separate the overall glaciated area into multiple sectors . These drainage basins are essential for partitioning mass changes of the ice sheet as they specify the area over which basin specific measurements are integrated . The delineation of drainage basins on ice sheets is challenging due to their gentle slopes accompanied by local terrain disturbances and complex patterns of ice movement . Until now in Greenland the basins have been mostly delineated along the major ice divides which results in large drainage sectors containing multiple outlet glaciers . However when focusing on measuring glaciological parameters of individual outlet glaciers more detailed drainage basin delineations are needed . Here we present for the first time a detailed and fully traceable approach that combines ice sheet wide velocity measurements by Sentinel 1 and the high resolution TanDEM X global DEM to derive individual glacier drainage basins . We delineated catchments for the Northeast Greenland Ice Sheet with a modified watershed algorithm and present results for 31 drainage basins . Even though validation of drainage basins remains a difficult task we estimated basin probabilities from Monte Carlo experiments and applied the method to a variety of different ice velocity and DEM datasets finding discrepancies of up to 16 in the extent of catchment areas . The proposed approach has the potential to produce drainage areas for the entirety of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets .
