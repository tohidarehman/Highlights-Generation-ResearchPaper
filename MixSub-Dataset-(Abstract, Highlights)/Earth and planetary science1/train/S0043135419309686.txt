 The UV persulfate process is a promising water treatment technology and it can not only effectively degrade contaminants of emerging concern but also control formation of disinfection byproducts . In this study we investigated the potential and mechanisms of chloropicrin formation during chlorination that followed UV PS pretreatment in the presence of low concentrations of nitrite . We found that when nitrite was present in the UV PS system unexpected high concentrations of TCNM were formed . The formation potential of TCNM was impacted by operational conditions and water matrix components high pH enhanced TCNM formation high UV fluence inhibited TCNM formation and organic compounds containing phenolic groups enhanced TCNM formation . We discovered that electrophilic substitutions by reactive nitrogen species were favored for phenolic groups and thus more nitrite N was transformed to organic nitrogen . We also found that more TCNM was generated from natural organic matter than algal organic matter during chlorination following pretreatment using UV PS . Accordingly more attention needs to be paid to TCNM formation if nitrite is present and the water is pretreated using UV PS . For example we found that if monochloramine was used as a disinfectant downstream of the UV PS process the formation of TCNM was reduced .

@highlight Large amount of TCNM was formed in UV PS chlorination in the presence of nitrite.
@highlight Presence of phenolic group favors for the above formed TCNM.
@highlight Nitrite is mainly transformed to organic nitro group during the UV PS process.
@highlight NH
@highlight Cl can reduce the above mentioned formation of TCNM compared to Cl
