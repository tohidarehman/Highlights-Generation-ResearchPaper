 Steel tubular columns filled with recycled lump concrete made of demolished concrete lumps and fresh concrete have been shown to have good mechanical properties at room temperature but the fire performance of such columns has remained poorly understood . This study presents an experimental investigation on the fire behavior of seven full scale square steel tubular columns filled with RLC or with FC alone . The parameters considered in the fire tests included the replacement ratio of DCLs the steel stirrups inside steel tube and their arrangement and the clear distance between the tube and steel stirrups . The columns with stirrups have the same total amount of steel as the control column without stirrups . The test results show that including DCLs up to a replacement ratio of 25 has little effect on a columns fire resistance compared with a columns without steel stirrups columns with embedded stirrups have significantly enhanced fire resistance without increasing the total steel usage due to the confining effect of the temperature shielded steel stirrups on the inner concrete core and fire resistance exceeding 180min can be achieved in some cases without any external fire retardant coating . The simple calculation method specified in EN 1994 1 2 2005 is extended to predict the fire resistance of columns with embedded stirrups .

@highlight Using DCLs has a little effect on fire performance of CFSTs.
@highlight Thinning steel tube and embedding stirrups improve fire behavior of CFSTs greatly.
@highlight Fire resistance exceeding 180min can be achieved for CFSTs without fire protection.
@highlight Longer fire endurance is got when the distance between stirrups and tube is greater.
@highlight Simple calculation method is extended to predict fire resistance of CFSTs with stirrups.
