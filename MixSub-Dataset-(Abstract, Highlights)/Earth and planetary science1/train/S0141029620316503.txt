 An innovative shear wall was proposed which was composed of high strength concrete and steel rebars as well as concrete encased CFST columns embedded at boundary elements . To study the cyclic and resilient behavior of the proposed wall four walls with shear span ratios of 2.2 were designed and tested under quasi static cyclic loads . The test parameters were the type of longitudinal bars at boundary elements the presence of steel fibers and the axial compression ratio . As test results showed within the limit of axial compression ratio the proposed shear walls had small residual deformation until a 2 loading drift ratio after that the hysteresis curve became full and the energy dissipation capacity increased indicating the desirable collapse resistance . Specifically the use of ultra high strength longitudinal bars at boundary elements significantly decreased the residual deformation and improved the reparability . In addition steel fibers effectively enhanced the deformation capacity of the proposed walls . Finally given the confined effects of CFST columns and stirrups on concrete a prediction model for the lateral load bearing capacity was established . The comparison between predicted and test results from this study and existing research verified the good accuracy of this model .
