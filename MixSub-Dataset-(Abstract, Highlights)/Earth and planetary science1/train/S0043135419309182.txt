 Bromide and natural organic matter are both precursors of halogenated disinfection byproducts in drinking water . During drinking water treatment process chloride form anion exchange resin adsorption is expected to be capable of removing these DBP precursors and in the meantime releasing chloride ions . The released chloride as well as the chloride initially present in source water could be oxidized through electrolysis to generate free chlorine for disinfection . Based on the above assumptions we developed a new disinfection approach using chloride form anion exchange resin adsorption followed by electrolysis to control halogenated DBPs . Parameter setup and optimization were performed for resin adsorption and electrolysis processes . Results showed that 93.7 of NOM and 90 of bromide could be removed at a resin dose of 20mL per 2L of simulated source water sample with a contact time of 1h . Meanwhile 49.5mg L of chloride was released from the resin to the water sample via anion exchange and the released chloride was further oxidized by electrolysis Ti RuO

@highlight A disinfection approach of resin adsorption followed by electrolysis was developed.
@highlight The new approach could decrease the formation of TOX four THMs and five HAAs.
@highlight Cytotoxicity of water samples treated with the new approach was reduced by 68.8 .
@highlight The new approach achieved 3.36 log
@highlight reductions of three seeded bacteria quickly.
