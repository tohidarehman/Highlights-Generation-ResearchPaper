 Shear links is a kind of commonly used energy dissipation component of which the yield force is always multiplied by a hardening factor to check the capacity of gusset plates and embedded parts or other connecting components . If the overstrength fact due to hardening is underestimated there are safety hazards . In this paper three tests on I shaped shear links with the LYP100 steel web are carried out . The specimens are designed with three extremely small length ratio to expand the range of existing data . Through the finite element analysis model the contribution of the flange to the shear force of the links is further studied and a schematic diagram of the theoretical study is given . Based on the parameters of the material combined hardening model an analytical model formula for evaluating plastic overstrength and calculating lower bound and upper bound of plastic hardening is proposed . The orthogonal finite element analysis of five geometric parameters web thickness
