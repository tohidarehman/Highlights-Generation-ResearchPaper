 The Mississippi Delta in coastal Louisiana has some of the highest rates of land loss in the world . This land loss crisis might become a global problem because most major deltas are expected to be vulnerable to land loss during the remainder of the 21st century and beyond . Despite this predicament we do not understand how land loss in a deltaic environment proceeds in time and space . Here we evaluate the spatial and temporal trends of land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Delta region using spatial statistics and landscape metrics . We used nearly 4800 Landsat images to construct a series of three year cloud free composites from 1983 to 2016 . From these data we created a stability index which is a dimensionless measure of the number of land to water transitions that a land pixel makes before being considered lost . Our results indicate that on the LMRD 75 of land loss is a single transition from land to water while about 25 of land pixels have two or more transitions before being considered lost . Using a local indicator of spatial association we show that pixels with similar SI tend to cluster together . Single transition clusters form elongated shapes they are densely packed and they are predominantly but not always found on marsh edges . On the other hand multi transition clusters form square like shapes they are more fragmented and they are usually found in marsh interiors . Our analysis further shows that the land loss area within the spatial patches with both high and low stability is strongly related to the density of land patches and their shape R

@highlight We define two types of landloss in the Mississippi Delta.
@highlight Single transition loss occurs when land converts to water
@highlight Multiple transition loss occurs when land converts to water multiple times.
@highlight 75 of land loss is single transition the rest undergo multiple transition
@highlight These transition types have different shapes and occur in different locations
