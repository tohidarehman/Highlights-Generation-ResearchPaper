 The seasonal snow cover is one of the most rapidly varying natural surface features on Earth . It strongly modulates the terrestrial water energy and carbon balance . Fractional snow covered area is an essential snow variable that can be retrieved from multispectral satellite imagery . In this study we evaluate fSCA retrievals from multiple sensors that are currently in polar orbit the operational land imager on board Landsat 8 the multispectral instrument on board the Sentinel 2 satellites and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer on board Terra and Aqua . We consider several retrieval algorithms that fall into three classes thresholding of the normalized difference snow index regression on the NDSI and spectral unmixing . We conduct the evaluation at a high Arctic site in Svalbard Norway by comparing satellite retrieved fSCA to coincident high resolution snow cover maps obtained from a terrestrial automatic camera system . For the lower resolution MODIS retrievals the regression based retrievals outperformed the unmixing based retrievals for all metrics but the bias . For the higher resolution sensors retrievals based on NDSI thresholding overestimated the fSCA due to the mixed pixel problem whereas spectral unmixing retrievals provided the most reliable estimates across the board . We therefore encourage the operationalization of spectral unmixing retrievals of fSCA from both OLI and MSI .

@highlight Extensive validation of fSCA retrieved from multiple sensors
@highlight High quality reference data set obtained using time lapse terrestrial photography
@highlight Aggregating NDSI derived binary snow cover maps leads to biased fSCA.
@highlight Spectral unmixing can resolve the mixed pixel problem providing near unbiased fSCA.
