 Dissolved organic matter in aquatic ecosystems reshapes the surface of nanoparticles greatly . Understanding how these changes influence the bioavailability of NPs is critical for accurately predicting the ecological risks of NPs . A quantitative model based on the two step internalization process enabled the differentiation between the adhesion ability of NPs to membranes and the internalization capacity . Using protozoa
