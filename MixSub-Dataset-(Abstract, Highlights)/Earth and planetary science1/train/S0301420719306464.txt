 Due to the decline of resources and a lack of motivation for development coal cities encounter problems related to sustainable development . This paper focuses on the analysis of the capability of different types of coal cities for sustainable development . We synthetically evaluated this capability for four typical coal cities in China from 2012 to 2016 by using the Super SBM model . The Malmquist index is used to dynamically decompose changes in the capability for sustainable development . We also analyze the ineffectiveness distribution of the input and output indicators and suggest directions for optimization . The results show the following the capability for sustainable development of coal cities in China was low and unstable overall . Major inefficiencies persist in resource allocation and utilization . The four coal cities were ranked in the order of growth regeneration maturity recession . Technological progress was the main factor affecting changes in the capability for sustainable development of China s coal cities . Inefficiency was mainly distributed over the economic output and inadequate economic output capability was the main factor hindering the sustainable development of most coal cities in China .

@highlight Quantitative evaluation of sustainable development capability of coal cities.
@highlight Dynamically decompose changes in the capability for sustainability.
@highlight Growth cities are the most sustainable while recession cities are the worst.
@highlight Insufficient economic output is the main reason for low capability.
