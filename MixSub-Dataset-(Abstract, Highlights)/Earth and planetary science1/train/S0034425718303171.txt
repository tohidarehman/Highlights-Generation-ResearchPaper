 Global repeat satellite imagery serves as an essential tool to understand ecological patterns and processes over diverse temporal and spatial scales . Recently the use of spaceborne imagery has become indispensable for monitoring giant kelp a globally distributed foundation species that displays variable seasonal and interannual dynamics . In order to develop and maintain a continuous and spatially expansive time series we describe a fully automated protocol to classify giant kelp canopy biomass across three Landsat sensors . This required correcting kelp canopy estimates to account for changes in the spectral response functions between the three sensors by simulating data using hyperspectral imagery . Combining multiple sensors also necessitated the use of an extended time series of diver estimated kelp biomass to validate each sensor . We also describe a novel gap filling technique using known spatial scales of kelp biomass synchrony to correct for missing data due to the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scan line corrector failure . These developments have led to a publicly available 34 year seasonal time series of kelp canopy biomass across 1500km of California coastline .
