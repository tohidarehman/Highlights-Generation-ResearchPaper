 Carbon fibre reinforced polymer is widely used in strengthening structures against dynamic loading . However debonding is one of the primary failure modes in CFRP strengthened reinforced concrete structures . This phenomenon is controlled by the interfacial shear bond slip behaviour between the two materials viz . CFRP and concrete . Although the quasi static bond slip response has already been extensively investigated studies on their dynamic behaviour are rather limited especially those under high loading rate regime . Limited knowledge of the interface behaviour will affect high fidelity simulations of FRP strengthened RC structures under dynamic loading regime . To shed light on the FRP bond slip behaviour under high loading rates the authors proposed a novel experimental method for high loading rate impact tests using a modified Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar set up . Based on this set up slip rate could be derived through single lap shear tests under impact loading regime . Dynamic enhancing effect on ultimate load shear bond stress and fracture energy could be quantified for a wide range of loading rates varying from 0.02 .

@highlight A new modified split Hopkinson pressure bar setup was designed to achieve impact load for the single lap shear tests.
@highlight Seventy five specimens were tested for parametric study from quasi static to impact loading regimes.
@highlight Parameter effects including CFRP stiffness bond width bond length and concrete strength were investigated.
@highlight Remarkable dynamic enhancing effect were found on the CFRP concrete bond properties.
@highlight Constitutive equations were proposed to model the dynamic bond stress slip behaviour of the CFRP concrete interface.
