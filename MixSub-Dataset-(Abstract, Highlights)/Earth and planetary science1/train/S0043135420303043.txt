 The curve number method developed by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1954 is the most common adopted method to estimate surface runoff . For years applicability of the CN method is a conundrum when implementing to other countries . Specifically countries with more complex natural environment may require more dedicated adjustments . Therefore the current CN look up table provided by USDA might not be appropriate and could be questionable to be applied directly to regions elsewhere . Some studies have been conducted to modify CN values according to specified natural characteristics in scattered regions of mainland China . However an integral and representative work is still not available to address potential concerns in general matters . In this study a large set of rainfall runoff monitoring data were collected to adjust CN values in 55 study sites across China . The results showed that the revised CN values are largely different from CN look up table provided by USDA which would lead to huge errors in runoff estimation . In this study the revised CN provides better reference guidelines that are suitable for most natural conditions in China . In addition scientists and engineers from other parts of the world can take advantage of the proposed work to enhance the quality of future programs related to surface runoff estimation .

@highlight CN China was developed by revising the original USDA curve number method.
@highlight Rainfall runoff monitoring data covering major land cover types were collected.
@highlight Adjusted CN values are largely different from CN look up table developed by USDA.
@highlight CN China is more suitable for runoff estimation in complex natural conditions.
