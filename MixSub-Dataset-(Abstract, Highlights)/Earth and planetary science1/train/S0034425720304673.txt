 Climate change is amplified in the Arctic region relative to elsewhere . By analyzing climate model simulations it has been found that the largest factor in Arctic Amplification comes from enhanced temperature feedbacks caused by the different vertical atmospheric warming profiles and a larger temperature change for longwave emission per unit of warming at high compared to low latitudes . Radiometers on polar orbiting satellites offer the best mechanism to derive sea surface temperature in the Arctic but given that the retrieval algorithms in the infrared are designed to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere mainly water vapor IR satellite derived SSTs have larger inaccuracies at high latitudes because the atmosphere can be very dry and cold . So the motivation of this study is to improve the algorithms to obtain more accurate SSTs which can be used to research the feedback mechanisms . To undertake the study the 5 year matchup database for MODIS on Aqua has been analyzed to characterize the differences between collocated and simultaneous satellite retrieved skin SSTs SST
