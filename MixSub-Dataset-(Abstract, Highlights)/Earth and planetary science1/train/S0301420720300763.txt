 This study evaluates the effectiveness of the environmental policy on residential natural gas use incorporating the role of economic demographic and environmental factors in the context of Organization for Economic Co operation and Development countries . To this end the study applies the Cross Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lags approach to analyse panel time series data ranging from 1980 to 2016 . The analysis demonstrates the environmental policy is an effective tool in reducing RNGU . This study also finds that energy price and income negatively and positively influence RNGU respectively in the long run . Demographic factors e.g . population population density and elderly population ratio augment RNGU in the long run . A rise in temperature is inversely associated with RNGU in the long run . Based on the empirical evidence this study emphasizes on the proper implementation of the undertaken environmental policies towards the sustainable development agendas .

@highlight Environmental policy is an effective tool for the efficient use of natural gas.
@highlight Income and price elasticities of gas use are positive and negative respectively.
@highlight Temperature is inversely associated with gas use.
@highlight The ratio of elderly people positively explain the natural gas use in OCED.
