 In the international arena it is often the case that in countries which largely depend on foreign resources energy security and its key components i.e . security of energy supply environment technology geopolitical and economic factors is a subject of concern . However due to the abundance of fossil fuel resources in resource rich exporting nations there is a lack of understanding of the risks around energy security and accordingly often a policy vacuum . Conceptualising energy security from different geopolitical vantage points will allow future concerns around energy supply security climate change and regional economic crises to be evaluated . By using policy documents and developing a time series approach and normalized z scores for a range of comparable metrics this article compares the energy security performance in six Caspian Sea countries individually and collectively . The article results show that Azerbaijan Iran Kazakhstan made significant progress in energy security since 1990 while energy security indicators in Russia Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan regressed . Iran has a leading position in energy security performance while Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have the lowest level of the energy security indicators compare to other region countries . This article both contributes a replicable definition of energy security that can be undertaken for other global regions and begins to incorporate diversification and renewables development to enhance domestic energy security assessment .
