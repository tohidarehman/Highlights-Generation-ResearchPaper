 Reject water contains complex components of organic compounds which have significant influences on the nitrogen removal performance when treated using biological autotrophic nitrogen removal technology . In this study a two stage partial nitritation anammox system was established to treat reject water COD NH

@highlight Two stage PN anammox processes were efficient to treat reject water.
@highlight 53 COD was removed in PN process including oxygen containing volatile organics proteins and humic acids.
@highlight The effluent COD consisted mainly of recalcitrant hydrocarbons.
@highlight Organics in reject water stimulated the growth of denitrifying bacteria
