 This paper presents a comprehensive study on the different behaviour of batter and vertical pile foundations in terms of stiffness degradation and damping properties under dynamic loadings . Firstly dynamic centrifuge tests were carried out and the variations of translational rotational stiffness and the associated damping properties were identified from a series of hysteretic loops . Results show that for the rocking behaviour the presence of batter piles causes a small decrease of the rotational stiffness and a great increase of the rotational damping for the horizontal translation behaviour batter pile foundation has much higher horizontal stiffness and translational damping compared to the vertical foundation . Then a set of stiffness degradation and damping curves for the translational and rotational behaviour of batter and vertical pile foundations are proposed . Finally the proposed stiffness degradation and damping curves were validated numerically by using equivalent linear approach . The numerical validation shows a good agreement with the experimental results .
