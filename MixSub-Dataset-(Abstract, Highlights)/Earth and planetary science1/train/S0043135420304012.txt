 Sertraline is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the last few years . Therefore it is not surprising that it is regularly detected in wastewaters surface waters sediments biosolids and biota . Effluents from wastewater treatment plants are the main contributors to its presence in the environment . The presented study aims to elucidate the processes involved in its removal concentrating mainly on sorption and biodegradation during wastewater treatment .

@highlight Sertraline is mainly removed from wastewater by adsorption.
@highlight Its biodegradation is influenced by the presence of readily biodegradable carbon.
@highlight Despite high removal efficiencies sertraline is still reported in the environment.
@highlight Seven novel biotransformation products are identified.
@highlight The identified biotransformation products are present in wastewaters.
