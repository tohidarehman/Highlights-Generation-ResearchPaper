 High strength concrete has higher strength to weight ratio and stiffness than normal strength concrete . Therefore the use of HSC can decrease the construction and demolition waste and embodied carbon content of structural members that enhances the urban sustainability . However HSC is more brittle than NSC . To further push up the maximum concrete strength limit in practical construction confining concrete by fibre reinforced polymer has been advocated to restore ductility . Compared with using hollow steel tube as confinement FRP has lighter weight higher tensile strength better corrosion resistance and is more durable and flexible . Nevertheless it is up to now a difficult task to predict accurately the uni axial stress strain behaviour of FRP confined concrete since the effect of confining stress concrete strength hoop and axial strains are inter related and need to be determined simultaneously . Herein to better understand and simulate the behaviour of FRP confined concrete a stress strain model has been developed which consists of the following three main components A hoop strain equation elaborated from the authors previous study on steel confined concrete columns for application to FRP confined concrete A modified confined concrete model considering stress path of confining stress Interaction between FRP and concrete . The model was verified based on 321 test results obtained from the literature the design application of the which to a broad range of FRP confined concrete structures is thus ensured .

@highlight A stress path dependent axial stress strain model of FRP confined concrete is proposed.
@highlight The model considers stress path history of confinement by using an adjusted active confined concrete stress.
@highlight The model was verified by 321 test results obtained by other researchers.
