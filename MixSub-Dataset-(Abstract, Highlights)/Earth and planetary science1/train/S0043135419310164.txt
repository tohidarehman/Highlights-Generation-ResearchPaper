 Bio denitrification is usually reported to be affected by operating and environmental parameters such as carbon source type pH value and temperature . In this paper the enhancement of denitrification performance with the elimination of nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission by

@highlight Nitrate removal of denitrifier was significantly increased by
@highlight MR 1.
@highlight Nitrite accumulation and N
@highlight O generation were significantly reduced by
@highlight S. oneidensis MR 1 promoted the generation transfer and consumption of electrons.
@highlight MR 1 showed marginal nitrate reduction capability.
