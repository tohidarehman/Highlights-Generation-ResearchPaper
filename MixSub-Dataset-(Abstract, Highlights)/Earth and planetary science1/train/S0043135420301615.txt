 Water distribution system contamination events caused by intentional negligent or accidental intrusion of biological chemical or radioactive contaminants have significant impacts on the health of the populations that it services . Therefore it is important to have an effective plan that can be readily implemented to minimize the impact of these contamination events . However limited research has been focused on strategic planning of the decontamination process of the contaminated infrastructure . This paper proposed a framework for assembling a disinfection plan in real time by partitioning a WDS into a number of district metered areas generating a solution region for each of the DMAs and assemble an effective decontamination plan using solution region generated . This framework has been applied to three contamination events . The results show that when planning for the decontamination stage of a contamination event the use of the proposed framework can significantly reduce the response time improve the quality of the decontamination plan and provide a model for optimizing the resource allocation .

@highlight A framework for planning water distribution system decontamination is introduced.
@highlight A decontamination plan can be readily assembled in real time.
@highlight Resources can be allocated dynamically subject to objectives and constraints.
@highlight Decontamination can be planned to be performed in parallel serially or hybridly.
