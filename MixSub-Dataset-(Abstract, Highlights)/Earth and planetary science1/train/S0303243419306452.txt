 Inaccurate information on forest resources could hamper forest conservation reforestation and sustainable management . Remote sensing products have emerged as key tools in forest cover monitoring . The Global Forest Watch dataset as an interactive remote sensing product is now applied by more than 2 million users including researchers conservationists and local communities for analyzing forest cover changes . The quality of this product varies spatially and local validations are recommended before using the data for inventory and management tasks . Our study evaluated the accuracy and suitability of the GFW dataset for analyzing Chinas forest cover . We conducted a validation based on a streamlined visual interpretation procedure using high resolution optical imagery on Google Earth to map the uncertainties and inaccuracies of GFW Tree Cover 2000 in China . We then estimated Chinas forest area after considering the data uncertainty made a comparison with the data reported by the National Forest Inventory of China to understand where and how the land based inventory differs from the presence absence based remote sensing data . The results showed that the overall accuracy of the GFW Tree Cover 2000 data reached 94.5 . The users and producers accuracy of forest classification was 89.26 and 82.13 . The sample based area estimation using GFW showed a larger forest area than the figure reported by CNFI in mainland China while data discrepancy varied at provincial levels . The study provides a detailed performance assessment of GFW in terms of accuracy of defining forest and we advise the consideration of data uncertainty in forest cover estimates for future forest management .

@highlight The study provides the spatial variations of the classification accuracy of GFW Tree Cover 2000 in China.
@highlight The GFW Tree Cover 2000 has a high overall accuracy in China reaching 94.5 .
@highlight China s forest area with confidence intervals was estimated.
