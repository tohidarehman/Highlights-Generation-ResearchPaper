 This study attempted to explore the effects of initial self stress in concrete and steel fibre on the compressive behaviour of concrete filled steel tube columns . A total of 36 CFST columns with a radial self stress ranging between 3.31MPa and 6.66MPa and a steel fibre volume percentage of 0 0.6 and 1.2 were tested under axial compression . The steel tube thickness of 2.5mm 3.5mm and 4.25mm was used to achieve different confining stiffness to the expansion of concrete core . The concrete strength grade of C40 C50 and C60 was used to obtain different expansion deformations . The failure mode axial load axial shortening curve ultimate load and ductility of CFST columns were investigated . Experimental results showed that all specimens exhibited shear failure and neither self stress nor steel fibre had obvious influence on the failure mode . Self stress in concrete enhanced the ultimate load of the CFST columns by 9.8 27.6 but decreased their deformability significantly . Adding steel fibres could enhance the ultimate load and slightly improve the post peak behaviour and ductility of CFST columns with self stress . Based on the results of this study and literature an optimum self stress level of 0.10 is proposed . Finally formulas are proposed to predict the load carrying capacity of FSS SCCFST columns under axial compression and the predictions agree well with the test results .
