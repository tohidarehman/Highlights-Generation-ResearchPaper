 Despite the concern about anthropogenic heavy metal accumulation there remain few multi level ecotoxicological studies to evaluate their effects in fluvial ecosystems . The toxicity of field collected sediments exhibiting a gradient of heavy metal contamination was assessed in

@highlight Harmful effects were detected in
@highlight exposed to mining sediments.
@highlight Heavy metals altered the transcriptional profile of genes related to hormonal pathways.
@highlight Biotransformation metabolism oxidative stress and oxygen transport were affected.
@highlight Disruptions in lipid profile respiration rate and life traits were also observed.
@highlight Mentum and mandible lengths significantly increased under highly polluted sediments.
