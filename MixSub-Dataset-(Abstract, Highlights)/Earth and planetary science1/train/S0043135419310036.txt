 Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a growing threat to global human health . Horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes is recognized as the primary contributor to antibiotic resistance dissemination . Silver nanoparticles are widely used in personal care products as antimicrobial agents . While heavy metals are known to induce antibiotic resistance in bacteria it is not known whether AgNPs in the environment can stimulate the HGT of ARGs . Here we report that both AgNPs and ionic silver Ag

@highlight Both silver ion and silver nanoparticle stimulate ARGs conjugation.
@highlight ROS overproduction is a critical factor to promote conjugation.
@highlight The enhanced conjugation could be prevented by adding a ROS scavenger.
@highlight Silver nanoparticle promotes conjugation due to nano physicochemical properties.
