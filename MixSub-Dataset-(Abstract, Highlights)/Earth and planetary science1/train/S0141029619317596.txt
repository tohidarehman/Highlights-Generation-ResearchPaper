 This paper presents a novel metallic damper named Honeycomb Structural Fuse for seismic applications . The HSF utilizes commonly available welded wide flange sections with honeycomb shape perforations on web . The HSF is designed to dissipate earthquake energy through plastic deformation of the web in shear while the flanges remain elastic . The HSF can be fabricated into different shapes to fit different structural demands . To investigate the seismic performance of the HSF a total of nine specimens with different honeycomb cell wall aspect ratios and honeycomb cell combinations were manufactured and tested under displacement based static cyclic loading . The influence of the different geometry parameters on the initial stiffness yield force yield drift force drift relationship buckling and failure modes are summarized in this paper . Finally a robust finite element model was built to simulate the hysteresis behavior of the HSF . The effectiveness of the proposed model was validated using experimental results . The study shows that the newly proposed HSF has stable energy dissipation which can be used as an efficient metallic damper for seismic applications .
