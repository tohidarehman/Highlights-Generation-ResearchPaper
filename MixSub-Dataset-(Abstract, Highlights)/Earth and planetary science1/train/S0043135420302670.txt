 Microcystins a group of cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacterial strains have become a significant microbial hazard to human and animal health due to increases in the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms . Many studies have explored the correlation between microcystin concentrations and abundances of toxin producing genes e.g .

@highlight Inconsistent results have limited the usage of molecular assays for studying blooms.
@highlight Novel primers targeting
@highlight A genes are evaluated and compared to published primers.
@highlight New primers distinguish the phylogenetic origin of
@highlight A genes in lake water samples.
@highlight New primers significantly correlate with measured microcystin concentrations.
