 During the last decade many vibration based structural health monitoring systems have been successfully implemented in different structures such as bridges towers stadia and wind turbines with the aim of studying the structure dynamics and its evolution over time eventually detecting the occurrence of novel structural behaviour that may indicate the presence of damage .
