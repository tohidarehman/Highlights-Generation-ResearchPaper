 A new joint system for connecting aluminum alloy rectangular hollow section members is proposed to overcome the problem of connecting rectangular tubes using the traditional Temcor joint . The structural performance of the ARH joint system under an out of plane bending moment is studied experimentally . The moment rotation

@highlight New joint for connecting aluminum rectangular hollow section members is proposed.
@highlight Six different full scale ARH joints are tested under an out of plane bending moment.
@highlight The M curves stress variation and failure modes of the ARH joint are obtained.
@highlight A bilinear model is proposed to summarize the M curves of the joint.
@highlight The influence of different factors on mechanical behavior of ARH joints is analyzed.
