 In this paper Ankang Reservoir is taken as the background in China and the measured data of No . 20030920 flood is used as an example to study the utilization of reservoir flood resources . According to the reservoir water level facing the time and the implementation conditions of dynamic control the current water and rain forecast information are referred . The pre storage and pre discharge method and scheduling mode of reservoir dynamic control are used to dynamically adjust the flood control level of the reservoir and the dynamic control of the flood control level is designed . It is concluded that the dynamic control range of Ankang Reservoir is 325327.5m which is regarded as the constraint of real time scheduling dynamic value for the flood control level dynamic control . This method is of important theoretical value and practical significance for safe economical and reasonable control of the reservoir .

@highlight We establish a dynamic control model of flood water level.
@highlight The risk assessment of the Ankang Reservoir after the dynamic control is carried out.
@highlight The results show that the risk rate of the reservoir is not increased after the dynamic control of the reservoir.
