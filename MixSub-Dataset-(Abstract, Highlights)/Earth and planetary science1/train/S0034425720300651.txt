 The quantification of leaf area index is essential for modeling the interaction between atmosphere and biosphere . The airborne LiDAR has emerged as an effective tool for mapping plant area index in a landscape consisting of both woody and leaf materials . However the discrimination between woody and leaf materials and the estimation of effective LAI have to date rarely been studied at landscape scale . We applied a voxel matching algorithm to estimate eLAI of deciduous forests using simulated and field LiDAR data under leaf on and leaf off conditions . We classified LiDAR points as either a leaf or a woody hit on leaf on LiDAR data by matching the point with leaf off data . We compared the eLAI result of our voxel matching algorithm against the subtraction method where the leaf off effective woody area index is subtracted from the effective leaf on PAI . Our results which were validated against terrestrial LiDAR derived eLAI showed that the voxel matching method with an optimal voxel size of 0.1m produced an unbiased estimation of terrestrial LiDAR derived eLAI with an

@highlight eLAI was estimated using leaf on and leaf off airborne LiDAR.
@highlight A voxel matching method was developed for the classification between leaf and woody points.
@highlight Subtracting eWAI from ePAI could cause significant underestimation of eLAI.
