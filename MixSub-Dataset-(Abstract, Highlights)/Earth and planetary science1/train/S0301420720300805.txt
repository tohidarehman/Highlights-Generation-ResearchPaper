 This paper addresses the determinants of metal recycling rates . The literature on recycling flows is scarce and does not directly address the issue of achieving a high recycling rate . In addition extant literature has not quantified the recycling rate response to metal prices . Therefore this paper explores factors that affect the recycling rate of different metals embodied in computers . We examine the effects of metal price metal concentration in products relative concentration ratio and embodied metal value on the recycling rate . Although the results reveal a significant effect of metal price on the recycling rate the marginal response is low across different models . This effect is not surprising and is in line with extant literature on recycling flows . Unfortunately for most unrecycled metals achieving a minimum embodied value is unlikely as it would require a median price increase by one or two order of magnitude . In addition it seems that the recycling rate is more elastic to other technical factors such as the metal concentration in products or the relative concentration ratio . While the findings suggest important public policy implications more data and interdisciplinary research are required to support these preliminary results .
