 This study assesses the impact of an improved soil moisture initialization using direct insertion methodology for convection resolving modelling of heavy precipitation events . State of the art 1km SM data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission SMOS BEC L4 version 3 are used for this purpose . A strategy is developed to prepare the SMOS L4 surface soil moisture product for the COnsortium for Small scale MOdelling model initialization by applying a cumulative density function matching bias correction and the exponential filter method to calculate corresponding SM profiles . The processed satellite derived product is validated with 38 observing sites from three in situ SM networks REMEDHUS SMOSMANIA and VAS . All networks measure at a soil depth of 5cm only at the SMOSMANIA network additional measurements at 10 20 and 30cm are available . Four HPEs are selected to evaluate the impact of the high resolution realistic initialization . The results show a high agreement index and a low root mean square deviation 0.03m

@highlight Novel methodology for model initialization with state of the art soil moisture data
@highlight Improvement of heavy precipitation forecasts with 1km SMOS L4 soil initialization
@highlight Optimal time for SMOS L4 initialization is 3days before precipitation initiation.
@highlight Improved understanding of soil atmosphere feedbacks and related processes
