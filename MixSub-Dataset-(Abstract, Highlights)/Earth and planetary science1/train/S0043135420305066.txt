 Frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms and red tides in freshwater and seawater poses serious threats to water treatment and drives the application of membrane based technologies in algal separation . Despite the high removal efficiency of algal cells and their metabolites

@highlight Frequent harmful algal blooms drive the application of membrane based technologies.
@highlight The generation of concentrate and waste streams presents a major challenge.
@highlight Two scenarios of membrane based processes for algal separation are discussed.
@highlight Recycling and beneficial use of concentrate is needed at low algal concentration.
@highlight Decontamination of concentrate and waste streams is critical at high concentration.
