 Inland lakes receive growing attentions on eutrophication and their roles in global carbon cycle . However understanding how inland lakes contribute to global carbon cycle is seriously hampered due to a shortage of long term records . This study investigated the carbon dioxide CO

@highlight Long term CO
@highlight dynamics had been investigated at high spatiotemporal resolution.
@highlight Lake Taihu is a significant CO
@highlight source with an annual CO
@highlight flux of 0.70.3Tgyr
@highlight The highest CO
@highlight level occurred in eutrophic zone and low in non eutrophic zone.
@highlight The annual lake CO
@highlight dynamics highly sensitive to human induced external input.
