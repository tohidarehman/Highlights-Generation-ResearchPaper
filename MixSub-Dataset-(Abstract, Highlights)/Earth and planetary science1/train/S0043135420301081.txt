 Seawater as an alternative magnesium source has the potential to improve the overall economics and environmental footprint of struvite production compared to the use of pure magnesium salts . However the dilution effect and the presence of other ions in seawater can reduce the phosphorus recovery potential and the simultaneous precipitation of other compounds may reduce the quality of the produced struvite . This work presents a comparative study of seawater and MgCl

@highlight Production of high quality struvite is feasible by using seawater.
@highlight Regulation of pH Mg Ca and N P minimizes the precipitation of calcium phosphate.
@highlight Seawater reduces the chemical costs of struvite production by 3050 .
@highlight Seawater reduces the CO
@highlight  footprint of struvite production by 840 .
@highlight Soluble components play a more important role than suspended solids.
