 This paper investigates the parameter determination of the tuned mass damper for mitigating the vortex induced vibration in bridges . At present there is no consensus on design formulas for the TMD in the VIV mitigation . An equivalent damping ratio is proposed to characterize the TMD contribution to the VIV mitigation based on a semi empirical nonlinear model . The effects of the uncertainties in aerodynamic parameters and structural parameters on the control effect of the TMD are studied . Three typical design formulas for the TMD are compared from the perspective of the effectiveness robustness and reliability . The results show that the equivalent damping ratio depends only on the TMD parameters and is sensitive to the uncertainty in the stiffness of the bridge . The vortex induced amplitude at lock in is moderate to the uncertainties in aerodynamic parameters . The design formulas for the free vibration suppression are the most robust option that avoids a high probability of failure which are recommended for the TMD mitigating the VIV in bridges . At last a numerical example of the deep water non navigable bridge of the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge is performed to confirm the rationality of the suggested design formulas .
