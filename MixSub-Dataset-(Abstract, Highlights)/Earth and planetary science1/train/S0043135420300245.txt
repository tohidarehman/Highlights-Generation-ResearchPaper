 The forward osmosis membrane distillation hybrid process has shown great promise in achieving zero liquid discharge in the textile industry recovering valuable dye molecules while producing large amounts of clean water . However the progress of this technology seems to have stagnated with the direct coupling of commercial asymmetric FO and MD membranes because water management in the system is found to be rather complicated owing to the processing of the different membranes . Herein we propose for the first time an FO MD hybrid process using a custom made self standing and symmetric membrane and a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene membrane in the FO and MD units respectively . Three types of operation modes were investigated to systematically study the process performance in the concentration treatment of model textile wastewater two commercial FO membranes were also tested for comparison . Owing to its low fouling propensity and lack of an internal concentration polarization effect the water transfer rate of our symmetric FO membrane quickly reaches equilibrium with that in the MD unit resulting in continuous and stable operation . Consequently the hybrid process using the symmetric FO membrane was found to consume the least energy as indicated by its lowest total cost in both lab and large scale systems . Overall our study provides a new strategy for using a symmetric FO membrane in the FO MD hybrid process and highlights its great potential for use in the treatment of textile wastewater .

@highlight A novel FO MD hybrid process using symmetric FO membrane was developed.
@highlight A model textile wastewater was concentrated by 10 times in the hybrid process.
@highlight Water equilibration was readily established in novel hybrid process.
@highlight Novel hybrid process consumes lower energy than that using commercial FO membranes.
