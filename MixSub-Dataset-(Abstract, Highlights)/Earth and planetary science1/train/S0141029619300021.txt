 A computational model for studying the mechanical performance of steel concrete columns under combined torsion is established via ABAQUS . The model is validated by experimental results . Through numerical simulations the influence of the axial load ratio torsion bending ratio concrete strength steel ratio longitudinal reinforcement ratio stirrup ratio and shear span ratio on the torsional behaviour of steel concrete columns is comprehensively investigated . The initial torsion stiffness and ultimate torsion strength of the column increase with increasing concrete strength and decreasing shear span ratio . The parameters in descending order of influence on the ultimate torsion strength are steel ratio torsion bending ratio stirrup ratio longitudinal reinforcement ratio and axial load ratio . Furthermore the seven parameters in descending order of influence on the ductility coefficient are the steel ratio shear span ratio concrete strength axial load ratio stirrup ratio torsion bending ratio and longitudinal reinforcement ratio .

@highlight Initial torsion stiffness increases with increasing concrete strength and decreases with increasing shear span ratio.
@highlight Ductility was reduced torsion bending ratio increased and the energy dissipation capacity decreased.
@highlight Influence order of parameters on the ultimate torsion is concrete strength shear span steel ratio torsion bending stirrup ratio longitudinal reinforcement ratio and axial load ratio.
@highlight Influence order of parameters on the ductility coefficient is steel ratio shear span concrete strength axial load ratio stirrup ratio torsion bending ratio and longitudinal reinforcement ratio.
