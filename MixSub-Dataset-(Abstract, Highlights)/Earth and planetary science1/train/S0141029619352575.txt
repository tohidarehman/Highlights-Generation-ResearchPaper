 A relatively new prestressed concrete composite slab with precast inverted T shaped ribbed panels is proposed in this paper . To study the influence of the three different rib forms on the flexural behavior of the CSPRP a series of bending tests on six full scale specimens and numerical studies were conducted . The test results indicate that the static behaviors including the cracking load ultimate bearing capacity and deflection are similar for the CSPRPs with different rib forms and the concrete layers can work compositely . Furthermore an extensive parametric study was carried out to investigate the static behavior of CSPRP considering the variations of prestress ratios prestress degrees spans concrete strengths and contact degrees . Lastly the comparison of the theoretical values with the test and parametric study results indicates the formulas proposed in this paper are accurate and suitable for practical designs .
