 Thermal based Zero Liquid Discharge process has been used for managing industrial brine . However conventional thermal ZLD process is very energy intensive . In view of this pre concentration techniques have been applied prior to thermal process to reduce energy consumption of ZLD systems . Capacitive Deionization is an emerging desalination technique and has yet to be extensively explored for the treatment of industrial brine especially for ZLD applications . High concentration of total dissolved solids and high fouling potential of industrial brine are two major challenges in CDI process . This paper reviews the possible factors for optimizing CDI process in industrial brine treatment namely cell architectures strategies in operation and fouling control . Cell architectures of membrane CDI and flow electrode CDI are preferred options for treating industrial brine compared with classic CDI in terms of energy consumption and fouling propensity . There are other operational strategies that could enhance the feasibility of using CDI process for ZLD application . These include reversed voltage desorption multi stage operation brine recirculation and fouling control . Fouling control methods comprise pretreatment antifouling modification antiscalant and chemical cleaning . These methods could be integrated to optimize fouling mitigation . In addition to providing insights on feasibility of using CDI to concentrate industrial brines this review also proposed guidelines for optimizing CDI process applied to treat industrial brines for ZLD applications .
