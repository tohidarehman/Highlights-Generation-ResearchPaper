 Remote surface measurements by imaging spectrometers play an important role in planetary and Earth science . To make these measurements investigators calibrate instrument data to absolute units invert physical models to estimate atmospheric effects and then determine surface properties from the spectral reflectance . This study quantifies the uncertainty in this process . Global missions demand predictive uncertainty models that can estimate future errors for varied environments and observing conditions . Here we validate uncertainty predictions with remote surface composition retrievals and
