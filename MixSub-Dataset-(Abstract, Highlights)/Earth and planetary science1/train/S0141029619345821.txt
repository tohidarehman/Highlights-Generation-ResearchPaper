 This paper investigates the flexural torsional buckling behaviour about the symmetric axis of axially loaded concrete infilled double steel corrugated plate walls with T section . The T CDSCW is composed of steel corrugated plates infilled concrete and intermediate bolts among which a positive composite effect further improves load bearing capacities effectively and thus reduces the thickness of composite walls . The failure mode of the T CDSCW with high height and small thickness is governed by global instability and flexural and flexural torsional buckling may occur for the T CDSCW under axial compression . This paper focuses on numerical and theoretical analyses of the flexural torsional buckling behaviour . Based on the refined finite element model validated by previous experimental researches parameter analysis is carried out to investigate the elastic and inelastic flexural torsional buckling behaviour . The formulas of the elastic flexural torsional buckling load are derived and prove it feasible to design flexural torsional buckling in accordance with torsional buckling . Numerical results show that the strength reduction factor of flexural torsional instability can be delineated well by the height to thickness ratio of the web and the normalized torsional slenderness ratio of the T CDSCW . Together with the design formulas of flexural instability the design formulas of flexural torsional instability proposed in this paper supplements the design method of axially loaded T CDSCWs and provides the foundation for further investigation into global instability of T CDSCWs under combined compression and bending .
