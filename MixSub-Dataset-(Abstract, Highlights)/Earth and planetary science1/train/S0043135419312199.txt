 In the aftermath of the lead contamination crisis that plagued the water system in Flint MI more than 35 000 water samples were collected from the citys premises . The majority of these samples were collected through a voluntary crowdsourced sampling campaign . The samples were analyzed for lead and copper concentrations by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality . In this study the crowdsourced sampling data was analyzed by means of spatial autocorrelation analysis to reveal the locations of statistically significant hotspot regions of high water lead levels and to track the spatiotemporal evolution of WLLs as the system recovered from lead contamination . The results showed that hotspot regions that experienced high WLLs were consistent with the areas where lead service line density was the highest . Additionally galvanized service lines and other lead containing plumbing components could have also contributed to lead release in hotspot regions . The temporal trend exhibited by the crowdsourced sampling data did not reflect a consistent decrease in WLLs despite the interventions implemented by MDEQ and EPA . Instead sampled WLLs remained high for several months after boosting the orthophosphate dose and launching a city wide residential flushing campaign . The findings of this study suggest that this could be partially attributed to disproportionate sampling from premises in hotspot regions of high WLLs and LSL density .
