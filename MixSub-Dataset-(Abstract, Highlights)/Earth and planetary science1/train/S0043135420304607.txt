 Natural organic matter can influence the toxicity and speciation of chromium in subsurface through redox reactions and complexation . Under anoxic conditions NOM can be reduced by microorganisms or geochemical reductants and the reduced NOM NOM

@highlight Reduced NOM can effectively reduce Cr VI at pH 59 under anoxic conditions.
@highlight Rate of Cr VI reduction occurred on a time scale of minutes.
@highlight Reduced Cr III can complex with NOM to form NOM Cr III colloids.
@highlight NOM Cr III colloids were stable due to strong electrostatic interactions.
@highlight The presence of high Ca
@highlight and Mg
@highlight concentrations suppressed colloid formation.
