 For retrospective land cover change analysis extending back in time earlier than approximately the year 2000 multispectral remote sensing data such as the Landsat archive are often the only available and systematically archived data source . However the spatial resolution of such observations often impedes the change analysis of geographic phenomena that may occur at sub pixel level such as changes in built up land . In such cases the integration of these data products with increasingly available contemporary high resolution settlement data employed as spatial constraints can potentially mitigate this drawback . Little research has been done regarding the quantitative potential of such integrative approaches often due to the lack of multi temporal reference data about changes in built up area at sufficient spatio temporal granularity and extent . In this contribution we present and evaluate a time series based approach for built up area change analysis using Landsat time series data spatially constrained by contemporary building footprint data . We evaluate the potential of our approach using a highly accurate multi temporal reference database of built up areas created through integrating publicly available building footprint and cadastral data in selected regions of the United States of America .

@highlight We propose a novel method for retrospective analysis of built up areas.
@highlight We created a large multi temporal training validation database on built up land.
@highlight Landsat time series data are integrated with cadastral and building footprint data.
@highlight Our method makes use of machine learning techniques and curve fitting approaches.
@highlight We compared supervised and unsupervised classification methods.
