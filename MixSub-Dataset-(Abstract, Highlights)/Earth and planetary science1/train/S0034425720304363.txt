 Terrain elevation is essential for land management navigation and earth science applications . Remote sensing advancements have led to an increase in the availability of a range of digital elevation models with global to quasi global land coverage . However the generation of these models in water bodies requires specialized approaches such as the delimitation of the shorelines of lakes over time . Therefore the processing costs are high in complex areas with many lakes . Currently there is no systematic topographic mapping of lakes and channels in large and complex floodplains using remote sensing data . We present here the first high resolution topographic mapping of the non forested portion of the middle lower Amazon floodplain using a new method based on in situ Amazon river water levels and a flood frequency map derived from the Landsat Global Surface Water Dataset . Validation using locally derived bathymetry showed a root mean square error of 0.89m for floodplain elevation and a good representation of spatial patterns with Pearson s correlation coefficient of 0.77 . Our approach for improving topographic representation in open water areas is an alternative to SRTM3 DEM or MERIT DEM which represents these areas as a flat surface . We also generated the Amazon River bathymetry using nautical charts from the Brazilian Navy and floodplain depths maps corresponding to the high and low water periods of the river flood wave . The results show that the storage volume in the open water floodplain varies 104.3km
