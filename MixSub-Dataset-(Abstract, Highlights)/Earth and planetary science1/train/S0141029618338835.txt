 This study is aimed at clarifying the seismic mitigation performance of structures with fluid viscous dampers as a function of the characteristics of the near fault pulse type ground motion and the structural dynamic properties . For this purpose the response spectra and energy response of single degree of freedom structures with FVDs subjected to 20 NP ground motions with different pulse periods

@highlight Seismic responses and energy dissipation distribution of structures are discussed.
@highlight The seismic performance of SDOF and MDOF structures with dampers is compared.
@highlight The influence of period ratio on the structures with dampers is presented.
@highlight Suggestions for improving the performance of structures with dampers are put forward.
