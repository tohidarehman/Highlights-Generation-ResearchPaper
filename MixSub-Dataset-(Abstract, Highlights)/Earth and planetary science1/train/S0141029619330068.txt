 At the initial design stage of a grid structure shape optimisation is an effective way to find the optimal structural form . However most of the shape optimisation methods do not take into consideration the imperfections thus the actual buckling load capacity of the optimised structure is usually low . In this paper an improved shape optimisation method is proposed one that is considering the effect of structural imperfection sensitivity . In this method the bending strain energy ratio is taken as a constraint and when the total strain energy decreases yet there is a certain proportion of bending strain energy in the structure . Consequently the resulted shape is not sensitive to the initial geometry imperfection and therefore an efficient structure with higher buckling load capacity and low imperfection sensitivity is obtained . In order to evaluate the redundancy performance of the optimised structure an index called structural overall redundancy based on damage model is proposed herein . The damage model is simulated by removing a key rod of the structure . The results demonstrate that the overall redundancy of the structure obtained by the proposed method is higher than that obtained by the traditional method thus an optimal design of a grid structure is obtained .
