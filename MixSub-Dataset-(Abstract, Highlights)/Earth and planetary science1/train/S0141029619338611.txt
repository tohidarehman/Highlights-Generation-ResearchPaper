 Some novel complex structural components of steel bridges are not explicitly addressed in the existing fatigue design codes and require an alternative local fatigue assessment method . This paper proposes a fatigue assessment protocol for these complex critical components of steel bridges using the hotspot stress method . A computationally efficient finite element model of a large scale bridge is created to provide the local structural response of complex components under simulated dynamic traffic loads . A multi scale model is implemented to accommodate higher dimension elements which are recommended for fatigue assessment via hotspot stress method . The multi scale model is created for the case study the Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth NH which is a vertical lift steel truss bridge with a novel gusset less curve welded connection . A truck load test is used to validate the multi scale model by comparing numerical results to the field collected data through the structural health monitoring system of the bridge . The result shows that the multi scale model can determine the critical hotspot stresses to study the fatigue performance of the bridges critical components .

@highlight A multi scale global finite element FE model is created for fatigue assessment of bridges via hotspot stress method.
@highlight The proposed global FE model considers the provisions of the hotspot stresses method using multiple dimensions of element.
@highlight The dominant traffic scenarios of the bridges are simulated via the validated FE model.
@highlight Hotspot stress variations are investigated along and in distance to the curved weld toe.
@highlight Hotspot and nominal fatigue remaining life of the welded components are compared.
