 Ornamental stones are natural building materials extracted from quarries which need to be cut and processed sustainably . Natural discontinuities adversely affect the sawing cutting of blocks into commercial size slabs . This work presents a 3D optimization algorithm for the sawing cutting of ornamental stone blocks . The developed algorithm is based on 3D modeling of discontinuities as data input . The algorithm search for the intersection between a 3D cutting grid formed of a determined size of slabs and the model of discontinuities leading to calculate the recovery ratio considering several cutting orientations and displacements of the 3D cutting grid . The algorithm was coded in a program named SlabCutOpt that allows speed problem solving . SlabCutOpt was implemented on a real case study of a commercial size limestone block extracted from a quarry in Italy . A number of 37 different commercial sizes of slabs forming 37 cutting grids were tested to investigate the optimum results in geo environmental direction and economic direction . The findings revealed that a certain slab size gave the optimum recovery ratio whilst another slab size provided the optimum revenue .
