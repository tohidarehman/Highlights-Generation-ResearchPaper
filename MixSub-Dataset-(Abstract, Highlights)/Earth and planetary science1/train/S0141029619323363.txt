 In order to enhance the flexural behavior of the stone building structures a technique of strengthening stone slabs using prestressed near surface mounted steel wire ropes is proposed . Six strengthened stone slabs were tested under four point bending by considering the reinforcement ratio level of prestressing and bonding agent as testing parameters . Additionally a bare stone slab was also involved in the test program for comparison purpose . It was found from the experimental investigation that the strengthened stone slabs exhibited ductile failure mode with visible deflection . Formation of multiple cracks in both constant bending zone and flexural shear zone was observed in the strengthened stone slabs . As expected abrupt fracture occurred in the bare stone slab as soon as the cracking moment was attained . Besides the improved failure mode the flexural strength of the strengthened specimens was improved significantly and tended to enhance with the increase of prestressing level . No end slip of the steel wire ropes was observed highlighting the favourable bond characteristics between the constituent elements . A simplified theoretical model to be used to predict the flexural strength of the strengthened stone slabs was developed and assessed .
