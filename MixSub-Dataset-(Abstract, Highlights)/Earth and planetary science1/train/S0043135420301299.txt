 The catalytic hydrogel membrane reactor is an interfacial membrane process that uses nano sized catalysts for the hydrogenation of oxidized contaminants in drinking water . In this study the CHMR was operated as a continuous flow reactor using nitrite NO

@highlight Lumen cyclic venting provided optimal reactivity and H
@highlight consumption efficiency.
@highlight The overall reaction rate depended on influent reactive species concentrations at catalyst sites.
@highlight A 1 D AQUASIM model described the species reaction profiles in the hydrogel.
@highlight The CHMR provided some protection for Pd from deactivating species in groundwater.
@highlight The CHMR reactivity was stable in groundwater over long term operation.
