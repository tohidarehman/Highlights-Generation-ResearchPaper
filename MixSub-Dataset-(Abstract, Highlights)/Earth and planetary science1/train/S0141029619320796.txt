 Prefabricated steel structure with earthquake resilience has become one of the hot topics in the field of seismic engineering . Based on the idea of damage control this paper proposes a new type of earthquake resilient prefabricated beam column steel joint with double flange cover plates which is formed by a circle tubular steel column with a cantilever beam an independent beam and a set of connecting devices in between . After the comprehensive analysis of the mechanical behaviour of PBCSJ the formulas are derived from three aspects the thickness of FCPs the number of flange connection bolts and the middle bolts interval . Then the design theory of earthquake resilient PBCSJ with double FCPs is established in this paper and its rationality and applicability are verified by 11 groups of 57 numerical examples . The study shows that the design theory can be used to accurately calculate the yield load of PBCSJ . The sliding moment of flange connection bolts and the ultimate load of PBCSJ also can be controlled effectively . The joints designed according to this theory have superior bearing capacity and ductility which ensures that the beams and columns are kept in elastic stage and provides preconditions for post earthquake repair of PBCSJ .
