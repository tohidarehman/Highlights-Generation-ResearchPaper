 Landsat imagery is an unparalleled freely available data source that allows reconstructing land cover and land use change including urban form . This paper addresses the challenge of using Landsat data particularly its 30m spatial resolution for monitoring three dimensional urban densification . Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks for scene recognition resulting in resolution loss the proposed semantic segmentation framework provides a pixel wise classification and improves the accuracy of urban form mapping . We compare temporal and spatial transferability of an adapted DeepLab model with a simple fully convolutional network and a texture based random forest model to map urban density in the two morphological dimensions horizontal
