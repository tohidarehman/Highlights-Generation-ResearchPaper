 Passive sampling and bioaccumulation assessments were used to evaluate the performance of activated carbon remediation of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated sediment offshore in Parcel F of the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard . Two different composite AC materials AquaGate PAC and SediMite were placed on the sediment surface covering an area of 3200 m

@highlight PCBs in surface sediments 16cm were reduced 89 and 91 by AC amendments.
@highlight PCBs in the clam
@highlight were reduced 8487 after 14 months.
@highlight sediment porewater by passive sampling 25 times larger than
@highlight Bioaccumulation in deposit feeders is estimated by equilibrium
@highlight porewater.
