 A single variable shear deformation theory is applied to free vibrations and harmonic response analysis of a multi storey frame model considering flexibility of foundation . The column foundation joints are modelled using three spring approach instead of fixed support assumption to show the effects of soil structure interaction on the dynamic behaviour of frame model . The dynamic stiffness formulations are used for both free vibration and harmonic response analysis . The results that obtained using SVSDT and Timoshenko beam theory are presented comparatively . The calculated natural frequencies are verified by finite element method . The convergence of FEM for the first three natural frequencies is presented for the fixed supported frame and frame considering SSI . The harmonic response curves are used to reveal the resonant and anti resonant frequencies directly . It is seen that using a lateral displacement response for harmonic response curves may cause to miss natural frequencies of axial dominant modes of the frame model . However all required natural frequency values of multi storey frames considering foundation flexibility can be obtained via harmonic response curves that plotted by using a vertical displacement response of a node of model . Moreover the proposed approach is validated by experimental data for scaled frame models which are fixed supported and flexibly supported respectively . The computation times for harmonic responses are tabulated for frame model on flexible foundation as well as fixed support assumption .
