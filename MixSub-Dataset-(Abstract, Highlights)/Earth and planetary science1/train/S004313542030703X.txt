 Repeated application of aqueous film forming foams in designated firefighting training areas has caused severe groundwater contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances . Many research efforts are currently engaged for the effective removal of these chemicals from environmental waters . In this study we demonstrate that modified clay produced by intercalating quaternary ammonium cations in the exchangeable interlayer sites of smectite clay can effectively remove PFAS pollutants in real groundwater via strong adsorption . The performance of the modified clay is superior to those of granular activated carbon or hard wood biochar and comparable to an ion exchange resin . Removal efficiency is not impacted by potential organic co contaminants or water chemistry Ca

@highlight Modified smectite clays efficiently removed PFASs in real groundwater.
@highlight Organic co contaminants barely influenced PFAS removal.
@highlight Piecewise adsorption isotherms described sorption of PFAS at field conditions.
@highlight Molecular dynamics simulation was processed to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms.
@highlight Ionic hydrophobic and lateral interactions dominated the adsorption.
