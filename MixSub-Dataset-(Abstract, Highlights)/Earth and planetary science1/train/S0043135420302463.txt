 Eutrophication and climate change scenarios engender the need to develop good predictive models for harmful cyanobacterial blooms . Nevertheless modeling cyanobacterial biomass is a challenging task due to strongly skewed distributions that include many absences as well as extreme values . Most modeling approaches alter the natural distribution of the data by splitting them into zeros and positive values assuming that different processes underlie these two components . Our objectives were to develop a probabilistic model relating cyanobacterial biovolume to environmental variables in the Ro de la Plata Estuary considering all biovolume values as part of the same process and to use the model to predict cyanobacterial biovolume under different risk level scenarios using water temperature and conductivity as explanatory variables . We developed a compound Poisson Gamma regression model an approach that has not previously been used for modeling phytoplankton biovolume within a Bayesian hierarchical framework . Posterior predictive checks showed that the fitted model had a good overall fit to the observed cyanobacterial biovolume and to more specific features of the data such as the proportion of samples crossing three threshold risk levels 0.2 1 and 2mm L

@highlight Cyanobacterial biovolume was modeled using a Bayesian compound Poisson Gamma approach.
@highlight The model uses two readily measured predictors water temperature and conductivity.
@highlight Cyanobacterial biovolume in out of sample observations was well predicted.
@highlight Conductivity and temperature had an interactive effect on cyanobacterial biovolume.
@highlight The model has a great potential for water management in coastal ecosystems.
