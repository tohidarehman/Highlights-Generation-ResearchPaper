 Integrated Constructed Wetlands area technology for the attenuation of contaminants such as organic carbon nitrogen phosphorous and sulphur in water coming from point or diffuse sources . Currently there is a lack of knowledge on the rates of gross N transformations in soils of the ICW bed leading to losses of reactive N to the environment . In addition the kinetics of these processes need to be studied thoroughly for the sustainable use of ICW for removal of excessive N in the treatment of waste waters . Gross N transformation processes were quantified at two soil depths in the bed of a surface flow ICW using a

@highlight Production and abundance of nitrate in ICW soils are very small.

@highlight Direct oxidation of organic N to nitrate is an important pathway in ICW soils.
@highlight Recalcitrant form of organic N in ICW was greater than the labile form.
