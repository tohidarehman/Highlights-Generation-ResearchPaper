 A novel technique for phosphorus recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate was developed using biochar derived from ironrich sludge . The biochar pyrolyzed from ironrich sludge at a low temperature of 300C showed a better phosphorus adsorption capacity than biochars pyrolyzed at other higher temperatures of 500900C with the maximum P adsorption capacity of up to 1.843mgg

@highlight Biochar derived from iron rich sludge can reclaim P from liquid anaerobic digestate.
@highlight Fe300 biochar showed a maximum P adsorption capacity of 1.843mgg
@highlight 70 P adsorption by chemical precipitation with 30 P by physical adsorption.
@highlight P absorbed by a chemical reaction can be released by
@highlight Fe300 biochar promoted seed germination rate and increased grass shoot length.
