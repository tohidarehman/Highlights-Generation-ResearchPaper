 The fine mode aerosols generally generated from anthropogenic sources play an essential role in global radiation balance climate change atmospheric environment and human health . However the FMA retrieval remains a challenge . An improved high resolution FMA retrieval algorithm based on the Spectral Neutrality of Surface Polarized Reflectance was developed using polarized satellite data . SNOSPR utilizes a lookup table approach to simultaneously retrieve high spatial resolution FMA parameters such as FMA optical depth AOD

@highlight A new algorithm retrieving FMA parameters and SPR simultaneously based on satellite polarized data was developed.
@highlight Spectrally neutrality and spatial invariance of SPR were first incorporated to choose the best retrievals.
@highlight The derived fine mode AOD has a high spatial resolution and wide coverage.
@highlight Comparison and validation with POLDER and AERONET products show a good agreement and a high accuracy.
@highlight Fine mode AOD retrieved from DPC proves the applicability of this algorithm.
