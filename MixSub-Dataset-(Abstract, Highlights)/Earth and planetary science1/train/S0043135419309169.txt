 Microbial nitrogen removal mediated by anaerobic ammonium oxidation are cost effective yet it is time consuming to accumulate the slow growing anammox bacteria in conventional wastewater treatment plants . Inoculation of anammox enriched pellets is an effective way to establish anammox and achieve shortcut nitrogen removal in full scale WWTPs . However little is known about the complex microbial nitrogen cycling networks in these anammox inoculated WWTPs . Here we applied metagenomic and metatranscriptomic tools to study the microbial nitrogen removal in three conventional WWTPs which have been inoculated exogenous anammox pellets representing partial nitrification anammox and nitrification denitrification nitrogen removal processes . In the PNA system of Bali ammonia was partially oxidized by ammonia oxidizing bacteria

@highlight Anammox was effectively established in a NH
@highlight  rich WWTP through pellets inoculation.
@highlight PNA and SNAD nitrogen removal systems were formed in the two anammox driven WWTPs.
@highlight Nitrite oxidizing activity of NOB
@highlight was inhibited in the PNA system.
@highlight Comammox
@highlight was the dominant nitrifier in the nitrification denitrification system.
@highlight A novel AOA predominated the nitrifier community in the SNAD nitrogen removal system.
