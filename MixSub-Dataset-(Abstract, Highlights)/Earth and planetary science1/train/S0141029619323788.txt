 The instability characteristics of an out cylindrical shell subjected to an annular flow where the fluid is flowing through the annulus between the inner shell and the outer shell are investigated based on the zero level contour method and the travelling wave solutions . The inviscid fluid dynamic forces related to shell vibrations are determined by the potential flow theory . The time mean Navier Stokes equations are utilized to obtained steady viscous forces based on the fully developed turbulent flow theory . The Flgge s thin shell theory is used for shell motions . Adopting the zero level contour method and the Galerkin s method the behaviors of losing stability of the flow shell system are given and physical reasons for the instability of the system are explained . Detailed studies are performed in order to elucidate quantificationally the effects of pre loads related to the steady viscous forces geometry parameters on the loss of stability . Especially the influence of the swirl number on the instability characteristics of the system is discussed .

@highlight Instability characteristics of fluid shell system by the new method are studied.
@highlight The physical reason for reducing stability of such system is explained.
@highlight The swirl number does not change the instability form but degrades its stability.
@highlight For annular flow viscous effects are negligible for a slender stubby shell.
