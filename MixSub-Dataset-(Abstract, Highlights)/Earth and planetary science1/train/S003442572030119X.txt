 Rapid climate change in Arctic regions is resulting in more frequent extreme climatic events . These can cause large scale vegetation damage and are therefore among key drivers of declines in biomass and productivity observed across Arctic regions in recent years .

@highlight New metrics quantified climatic drivers of extreme event driven Arctic browning.
@highlight These metrics explained up to 63 of variation in greenness at affected sites.
@highlight Prolonged warmth or vegetation exposure in winter is associated with browning.
@highlight Event metrics correlated with satellite greenness across Arctic Norway.
