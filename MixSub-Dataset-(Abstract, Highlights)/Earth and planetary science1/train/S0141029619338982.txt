 Unbonded post tensioned precast concrete frame exhibits excellent performance in resisting seismic load from experimental tests and post earthquake investigations . However the behavior of UPPC frames subjected to extreme load such as the loss of a column due to explosion is still not well studied . To fill this knowledge gap in this paper four 1 2 scaled UPPC beam column substructures were tested under both quasi static and dynamic loading regimes . The comparative study between these two test regimes were subsequently performed which provides a clear understanding of the difference of these two test methods in progressive collapse studies for other researchers . The test results indicated that UPPC frames achieved required load redistribution capacity to mitigate progressive collapse . The failure modes of the frames observed in dynamic test were quite similar to that in quasi static tests . Moreover it was found that strain rate effects were insignificant for progressive collapse events caused by suddenly column removal . Based on the measured load resisting function from quasi static tests a single degree of freedom model with the consideration of strain hardening and softening was developed . After validation the proposed SDOF model was used to quantify the effects of service load initial velocity initial displacements and damping ratio on the dynamic response . It was found that the damping ratio non zero initial velocity and initial displacement are the three most influential parameters .
