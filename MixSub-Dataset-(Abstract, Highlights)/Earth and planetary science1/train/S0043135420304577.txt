 Many new sorbents have been introduced as an alternative for granular activated carbon the most common sorbent for dissolved organic matter removal . In the current study we developed an applicable granular composite based on a flocculant commonly employed for drinking water treatment adsorbed to montmorillonite . DOM adsorption from surface waters Lake Kinneret and Suwannee River with low and high specific ultraviolet absorption respectively by composite and GAC columns was studied . Adsorption of DOM from Suwannee River was significantly higher by the composite column in comparison to the GAC column while an opposite trend was obtained for the adsorption of DOM from Lake Kinneret . In situ regeneration of the columns with a brine solution was extremely efficient and inefficient for the composite and GAC columns respectively . Adsorption of both waters post regeneration by the composite column was not compromised while GAC effectiveness decreased . The opposite trend in DOM adsorption from Suwannee River and Lake Kinneret was explained by the different affinities of the sorbents towards various DOM molecules . Distinguishing between different DOM components adsorbed by GAC and the composite was supported by

@highlight Drinking water treatment cationic polymer was adsorbed to clay and granulated as a sorbent.
@highlight DOM filtration from high SUVA water by composite vs. GAC columns is very efficient.
@highlight The composite and GAC sorbents target different DOM molecules.
@highlight DOM filtration from low SUVA water by integrated column composite GAC is efficient.
@highlight Integrated column mitigates temperature fluctuation effects stabilizing performance.
