 This study proposes a novel method to directly treat reject water with a high ammonium content without relying on dilution . The originality of this method resides in leveraging the coordinated action of a methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium and the biogas generated from wastewater treatment facilities . Specifically ammonium is removed through autotrophic assimilation in the glutamate cycle of methanotrophs and
