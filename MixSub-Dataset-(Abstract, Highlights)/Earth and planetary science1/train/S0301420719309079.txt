 Cross country studies on the effect of hydrocarbon revenues and non hydrocarbon tax effort are only now emerging . Using an expanded global dataset in a two stage least squares framework we confirm a displacement effect . A percentage point increase in hydrocarbon revenues displaces non hydrocarbon revenues by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points . With low levels of domestic revenue and a debt crises looming for many developing countries resource rich countries need to leverage on their resource wealth to invigorate the non resource sectors of their economies . This should widen the tax base and optimize the tax take for oil rich countries over the long haul .

@highlight Oil rich countries sacrifice their fiscal capacity during commodity booms.
@highlight Hydrocarbon revenues displace non hydrocarbon revenues by 2 to 3 percentage points.
@highlight The quality of institutions do not seem to reverse this displacement effect when commodity prices are rising.
@highlight The displacement effect of hydrocarbon revenues is persists beyond the short run.
