 This paper assessed the precision of 20 Hz sea level anomaly estimates with different sea state bias corrections from reprocessed Jason 1 2 3 and Sentinel 3A data over the period of 20022019 within 100km from the entire Australian coast . The altimeter waveforms were retracked by the modified Brown peaky retracker for Jason missions and by the SAMOSA retracker for Sentinel 3A . We recalculated the 20 Hz and composite SSB corrections using a regional parametric model from 20 Hz retracked estimates of the SLA significant wave height and wind speed . The composite SSB correction which was recomputed after removing the retracker dependant correlated error in 20 Hz SLA is found to achieve better performance than other SSB corrections in the study area . Applying the 20 Hz and composite SSB corrections has reduced 10 and 13 of noise respectively in the MBP retracked 20 Hz Jason SLA estimates while only 2 of noise reduction is shown by applying the 1 Hz standard SSB correction . It is also found that the improvement of retracked Sentinel 3A SLA estimates by SSB corrections is very low indicating a dedicated SSB correction model should be developed for the SAR mode altimeter .
