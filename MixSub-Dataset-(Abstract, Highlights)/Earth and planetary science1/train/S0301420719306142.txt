 Price discovery and market efficiency are the centerpiece of the market microstructure design . This study investigates the nonlinear correlation between the spot and futures prices in China s copper market using nonlinear Granger causality and multifractal methods and it further analyzes the dynamic efficiency of China s copper futures market . According to the results of the nonlinear Granger causality test there is a significant bidirectional nonlinear causality between the spot and futures prices in China s copper market . Excluding the effects of the first and second orders there is still a high order correlation between the spot and futures prices of the copper market . Additionally the multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis method is used to obtain the long term correlations of high order in the spot and futures markets . The time varying rolling Hurst exponent indicates that the efficiency of China s copper futures market has gradually become more effective over time .

@highlight The nonlinear Granger causality and multifractal methods are applied to test market efficiency.
@highlight There is a significant high order nonlinear correlation between futures and spot markets.
@highlight China s copper futures market efficiency becomes more effective over time.
