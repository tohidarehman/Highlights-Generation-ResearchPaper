 We recently reported that when a confocal Raman microscope imaged a nanoplastic with the diameter of 100nm the imaging lateral size was 300400nm due to the diffraction limit of the laser spot . In this study we examine the lateral intensity distribution of the Raman signal emitted by nanoplastics within the excitation laser spot . We find that the Raman emission intensity similar to the excitation power density distributed within a laser spot also follows a lateral Gaussian distribution . To image and visualise individual nanoplastics we decrease the mapping pixel size in a hope to generate an image with high resolution and simultaneously to pick up items from the blind point . We can then either offset the colour to intentionally image only the high intensity portion of the Raman signal to localise the exact position of the nanoplastic or categorise the imaged nanoplastics to different groups via their Raman intensity to simultaneously and separately visualise large nanoplastics strong Raman signals medium nanoplastics and small nanoplastics in an effort to avoid the shielding and overlooking of weak signals . We also cross check multi images simultaneously mapped at two or three characteristic peaks via either a logic OR or a logic AND algorithm . Thus the imaging uncertainty can be significantly reduced from a statistical point of view .

@highlight Nanoplastic smaller than the size of a laser spot is imaged down to 30nm.
@highlight A link is established between Gaussian peak width intensity image and the size of nanoplastics.
@highlight Decreasing the scanning pixel size and offsetting the colour are helpful for imaging.
@highlight Imaged nanoplastics can be categorise to different groups via their signal intensity size.
@highlight Multi images are analysed via either logic OR or logic AND algorithm.
