 Microalgae cultivation has been receiving increasing interest in wastewater remediation due to their ability to assimilate nutrients present in wastewater streams . In this respect cultivating microalgae in membrane photobioreactors allows decoupling the solid retention time from the hydraulic retention time which enables to increase the nutrient load to the photobioreactors while avoiding the wash out of the microalgae biomass .

@highlight Reducing the light path from 25 to 10cm increased MPBR performance.
@highlight Shorter light path improved the photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae.
@highlight Light path reduction implied the decrease of membrane flux from 26 to 15 LMH.
@highlight Legal discharge limits were successfully met.
@highlight NO
@highlight and sCOD VSS could be used to prevent possible culture deteriorations.
