 Recovery of rare earth elements from industrial wastewater has drawn great attention due to their potential environmental toxicity as well as their high demand in modern technologies . In this study we developed a magnetic composite based on the high surface area porous cyclodextrin polymer

@highlight Porous CD polymer P CDP and its magnetic composite 
@highlight  were prepared.
@highlight overcomes the clogging and high backpressure issues of P CDP.
@highlight can be easily isolated by an external magnet.
@highlight Both polymers showed fast and selective adsorption of REEs.
@highlight Both adsorbents can be regenerated multiple times by washing with acidic solutions.
