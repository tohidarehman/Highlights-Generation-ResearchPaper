 Peroxymonosulfate is extensively used as an oxidant to develop the sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes in the decontamination of organic pollutants and various PMS activation methods have been explored . Visible light assisted PMS activation to construct a Fenton like process has shown a great potential for pollution control . In our work BiVO

@highlight PMS was effectively activated by BiVO
@highlight nanosheets for water purification under visible light.
@highlight Separation of electron hole pairs and generation of oxidative species were enhanced.
@highlight Visible light assisted PMS activation Fenton like mechanism was elucidated.
@highlight High mineralization and low biotoxicity validated the application potential of the system.
