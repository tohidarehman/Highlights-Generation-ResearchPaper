 Photogranules are dense spherical agglomerates of cyanobacteria microalgae and non phototrophic microorganisms that have considerable advantages in terms of harvesting and nutrient removal rates for light driven wastewater treatment processes . This ecosystem is poorly understood in terms of the microbial community structure and the response of the community to changing abiotic conditions . To get a better understanding we investigated the effect of hydraulic retention time on photogranule formation and community assembly over a period of 148 days . Three laboratory bioreactors were inoculated with field samples from various locations in the Netherlands and operated in sequencing batch mode . The bioreactors were operated at four different HRTs while retaining the same solid retention time of 7 days . A microbial community with excellent settling characteristics was established within 25 weeks . The observed nutrient uptake rates ranged from 24 to 90 mg

@highlight Lower HRT provides a shortcut to well settling biomass and photogranules.
@highlight Lower HRT increases overall volumetric removal rates.
@highlight Correlation network analysis revealed key players in photogranule assembly and function.
@highlight Motile filamentous cyanobacteria and EPS producer are important in photogranulation
@highlight Nitrification denitrification is an important removal pathway in photogranules.
