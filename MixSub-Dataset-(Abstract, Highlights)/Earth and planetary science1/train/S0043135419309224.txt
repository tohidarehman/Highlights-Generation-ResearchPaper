 Biological ion exchange has proved to remove natural organic matter better than biological activated carbon . This raises the question if BIEX can be integrated into a full scale drinking water treatment plant to remove NOM and ammonia . In this study a pilot plant consisting of one BIEX filter three GAC filters and one BAC filter was set up as second stage filtration at the Sainte Rose drinking water treatment plant . The pilot plant was operated for a period of nine months without regeneration of the ion exchange resins . The influent water showed low DOC and high sulfate concentrations . Except of a short peak of DOC released at about 1 000 BV the BIEX filter achieved a nearly constant removal of 2936 over the whole study period . The DOC removals of GAC were similar to BIEX at 8000 BV but then stabilized at 1324 after 8 000 BV . Most DOC removal in the BIEX filter was achieved at the top 30cm layer compared to 6266 removal in the GAC BAC filters in the same layer . After the rapid exhaustion of the primary ion exchange capacity sulfate displaced the fraction of NOM with lower affinity than sulfate corresponding to the initial DOC release in the BIEX filter . The fraction of NOM with higher affinity than sulfate can still replace sulfate which explains the good long term performance of the BIEX filter . BIEX released ammonia with an average of 15 in warm water condition probably related to the small diameter of the column which limited backwash effectiveness .

@highlight BIEX filter was operated for nine months without regeneration of the resins.
@highlight BIEX filter achieved better NOM removal compared to GAC BAC filters.
@highlight NOM removal in BIEX filter was mainly due to the secondary ion exchange.
@highlight BIEX filter released ammonia in warm water condition.
