 Selection of influential geometric imperfections may be crucial for efficient calculations of lower buckling strengths of thin cylindrical shells subject to axial compression by the geometrically and materially nonlinear FEM analysis with imperfections . The imperfections in the shapes of eigenmodes provided by the preliminary linear buckling analysis of perfect shells are brought into focus . For categorizing a large set of potentially influential eigenmodes customarily normalized to unit amplitude the strain energy of the shell deformed in the shape of each eigenmode is determined . By the square root of the strain energy an unconventional energy measure of the shell geometric imperfections is defined . Considering the eigenmode imperfections and localized imperfections normalized by the amplitude and by the energy measure the buckling strengths of an imperfect shell are compared . A preference is given to the normalization of the geometric imperfections by the energy measure . Nevertheless for the currently revised Structural Eurocodes particularly for the standardization of GNIA GNMIA FEM design of shells based on amplitudes of geometric imperfections an amendment is suggested .
