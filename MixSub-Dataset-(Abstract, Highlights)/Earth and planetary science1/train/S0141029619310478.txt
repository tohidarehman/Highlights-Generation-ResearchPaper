 Cross frames must provide necessary stiffness for stability but excessive stiffness can be detrimental by causing stress distributions differing from designers expectations and or uneconomical cross frame designs . Cross frames are also generally assumed to have important roles in live load distribution . This work evaluates a novel means for considering the overall stress distribution throughout finite element models in contrast to other contemporary methods that quantitatively analyze only isolated stresses . This method is used to evaluate different cross frame designs including the absence of cross frames for simply supported composite skewed steel I girder bridges . Considering all results from both newly proposed and conventional metrics it is demonstrated that the influence of cross frame design often has a more significant influence than the presence or absence of cross frames . Thus the importance of cross frames may be less than previously thought . Furthermore the data reveals that the greatest differences between models were generally due to the use of staggered cross frames which also cause the most significant departures from traditional expectations of girder behavior .

@highlight Removing cross frames can have a lesser effect than changing the cross frames.
@highlight The greatest differences were typically due to staggered cross frames.
@highlight Distribution factors were not greatly influenced by skew angle.
