 Historical wetland hydrology data are instrumental to support the design of wetland management and restoration strategies but are rarely available . In this study we tested the capabilities and limitations of a simple methodological framework based on publicly available MODIS Land Reflectance Products to estimate wetland soil surface saturation and inundation spatiotemporal dynamics . Using supervised learning and high resolution groundwater and surface water elevation data the framework searches for spectral algorithms referred to as the wet dry wetland status classifier and the continuous wetland dynamics identifier that best predict upper soil layer wetness status in the study wetland . We used Google Earth Engine for fast access and processing of the full range of MODIS data . The capabilities of GEE also enabled us to readily conduct a comparative assessment of the MODIS 8 day composite and daily collections and test various pixel level quality filters to select reliable data at the highest possible temporal resolution . We tested the framework on the internationally recognized Ramsar site Palo Verde National Park wetland in Costa Rica and we obtained good results overall prediction accuracy of 86.6 and kappa coefficient of 0.7 for the WSC r

@highlight A systematic framework for wetland soil saturation and flooding detection is proposed.
@highlight The framework is tested with high temporal resolution water elevation data.
@highlight Hydric status diagnostic mismatch when working with multiple sensors is explained.
@highlight Opportunities and limitations of using the full range of MODIS data is presented.
@highlight New insights into Palo Verde wetland hydroperiod history and drivers is gained.
