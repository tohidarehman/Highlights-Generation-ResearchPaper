 In recent years the concept of Local Climate Zones has become a new standard in the research of urban landscapes . LCZs outline a classification scheme which is designed to categorize urban and rural surfaces according to their climate relevant properties irrespective of local building materials or cultural background . We present a novel workflow for a high resolution derivation of LCZs using multi temporal Sentinel 2 composites and supervised Convolutional Neural Networks . We assume that CNNs due to their potential invariance to size and illumination of objects are best suited to predict the highly context based LCZs on a large scale . As a first step the proposed workflow includes a fully automated generation of cloud free S2 composites . These composites serve as training data basis for the LCZ classifications carried out over eight German cities . Results show that by using a CNN overall accuracies can be increased by an average of 16.5 and 4.8 percentage points when compared to a pixel based and a texture based Random Forest approach respectively . If sufficient training data is available CNN models proved to be robust in classifying unknown cities and achieved overall accuracies of up to
