 Engineered cementitious composites has been widely used for structural members and joints under various loading conditions . Nevertheless the shear transfer mechanism at the interface of reinforced ECC needs further study due to the lack of experimental results . This paper investigates the interface shear transfer of reinforced ECC subjected to push off loads . Experimental tests were carried out to quantify the shear resistance and to investigate the shear transfer mechanisms at different loading stages . The effects of ratio and type of stirrups were considered in the experimental programme . The peak and residual shear resistances of reinforced ECC were obtained and compared with the calculated values from existing design methods . The interface shear transfer mechanisms were determined by analysing the measured strains of stirrups and transverse dilatancy . A design equation was proposed based on experimental results . Finally conclusions were drawn for the interface shear design of reinforced ECC .

@highlight The peak and residual shear stresses of reinforced ECC were determined through push off tests.
@highlight The interface shear transfer mechanisms of reinforced ECC were studied based on the measured strain of stirrups and transverse dilatancy.
@highlight A design method was proposed in accordance with test data which considered the contributions of ECC and stirrups.
