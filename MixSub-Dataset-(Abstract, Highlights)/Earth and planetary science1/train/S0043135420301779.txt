 Previous studies have reported that biofilm extracted from full scale biofilters can serve as nitrogenous disinfection by product precursors . Detached biofilm materials could escape during filter ripening and form N DBP upon chloramination . This study examined the potential breakthrough of biofilm and N DBP precursors during filter ripening at two water treatment plants . The presence of biofilm material in aqueous samples was estimated by total adenosine triphosphate levels N DBP formation potential tests were conducted under uniform formation conditions to quantify N nitrosodimethylamine and haloacetonitrile HAN

@highlight Elevated NDMA FP and total ATP levels in the influent during filter ripening.
@highlight Breakthrough of particulate NDMA precursors during filter ripening.
@highlight Biofilters consistently removed NDMA precursors regardless of filter ripening.
