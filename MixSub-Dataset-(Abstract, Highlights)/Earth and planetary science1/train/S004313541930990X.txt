 Biohythane production from wastewater via anaerobic fermentation currently relies on two stage physically separated biohydrogen and biomethane reactors which requires closed monitoring the implementation of a control system and cost intensive complex operation . Herein an innovative multistage anaerobic hythane reactor was reported via integrating two stage fermentation into one reactor . MAHR was constructed using an internal down flow packed bed reactor and an external up flow sludge blanket to enhance microbial enrichment and thermodynamic feasibility of the associated bioreactions . The performance of MAHR was investigated for 160d based on biogas production metabolic flux and microbial structure in comparison to a typical anaerobic high rate reactor . A biohythane production with an optimized hydrogen volume ratio and a high methane content was achieved in the hythane zone M
