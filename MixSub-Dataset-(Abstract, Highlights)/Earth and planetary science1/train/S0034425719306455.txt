 Small islands face environmental issues directly or indirectly related to land cover land use changes such as natural hazards climate change loss of biodiversity and proliferation of invasive alien species some of which are caused by direct human exploitation . A Land Cover Land Use Change detection approach based on PCA and vegetation indices derived from low cost high resolution RapidEye multispectral satellite data and available vegetation maps was developed to assess vegetated forested aboveground carbon stocks and their changes in Madeira Island Portugal for the period between December 2009 and August 2011 due to catastrophic events occurred in 2010 .
