 Precast construction of structural buildings requires connection techniques that can shorten the process using only simple on site activities while still guaranteeing adequate strength energy dissipation stiffness and ductility . The construction methods should decrease the use of formwork and temporary bracing to save time and costs . In this study innovative hybrid connections using steel tubes steel plates and steel couplers to join beams and columns were proposed and tested under reversed cyclic loading . Five half scale samples of the hybrid precast joints including the monolithic and precast joints were examined to evaluate the seismic performance of the connections . The hybrid connections showed better performance in terms of load displacement drift ratio ductility strength stiffness and energy dissipation compared to a monolithic connection . The drift ratio moment capacity strength and total cumulative energy dissipation of the hybrid connections were higher by 12.550.0 34.6859.57 35.060.0 and 50.99331.32 respectively when compared with a monolithic connection . The failure modes of the hybrid connections were governed by yielding steel reinforcement yielding steel plate and flexural failure with less extensive damage compared to the monolithic joint . The hybrid connections were effective in shifting the plastic hinges to outside the connection zone . Therefore the hybrid connections can be used in high seismic zones because the superior performance results meet the requirements of the seismic codes .

@highlight The plastic hinges of hybrid connections were enhanced to form outside the connection zone.
@highlight The performance of hybrid connections effectively emulated monolithic joints in seismic zones.
@highlight Hybrid joints using steel plates can be used in highly seismic regions due to the high ductility ratio.
@highlight The use of steel plates steel tubes steel couplers and steel bolts in the joint enhanced the seismic performance.
