 Curvilinear stiffened panels are being developed for aerospace structures and other applications . This paper presents an experimental and numerical study into the vibration response of three curvilinear stiffened square plates clamped at the edges . The experimental modal analysis was performed using laser Doppler vibrometry and an impact hammer test . Two of the three plates was constructed with curvilinear stiffener geometry while the third was a straight stiffened plate with the stiffeners oriented at an angle to the edge of the plate . Even though the natural frequencies of the plates are similar the different stiffening patterns was sufficient in providing unique directional properties and therefore distinct mode shapes . The numerical modal analysis of the plates was performed using finite element analysis . A comparison of the experimental and numerical results was carried out in terms of natural frequencies and mode shapes using relative differences and modal assurance criterion respectively . The experimental and numerical results were in good agreement for all the three plates . The difference between experimental and numerical natural frequencies was typically less than 5 and the diagonal MAC values typically ranged from 0.8 to 1 . This is in line with previously published results in the literature . The reasons for differences between the experimental and numerical results and the practical significance of the findings are also discussed .
