 Satellite remote sensing offers an effective remedy to challenges in ground based and aerial mapping that have previously impeded quantitative assessments of global seagrass extent . Commercial satellite platforms offer fine spatial resolution an important consideration in patchy seagrass ecosystems . Currently no consistent protocol exists for image processing of commercial data limiting reproducibility and comparison across space and time . Additionally the radiometric performance of commercial satellite sensors has not been assessed against the dark and variable targets characteristic of coastal waters . This study compared data products derived from two commercial satellites DigitalGlobe s WorldView 2 and Planet s RapidEye . A single scene from each platform was obtained at St. Joseph Bay in Florida USA corresponding to a November 2010 field campaign . A reproducible processing regime was developed to transform imagery from basic products as delivered from each company into analysis ready data usable for various scientific applications . Satellite derived surface reflectances were compared against field measurements . WorldView 2 imagery exhibited high disagreement in the coastal blue and blue spectral bands chronically overpredicting . RapidEye exhibited better agreement than WorldView 2 but overpredicted slightly across all spectral bands . A deep convolutional neural network was used to classify imagery into deep water land submerged sand seagrass and intertidal classes . Classification results were compared to seagrass maps derived from photointerpreted aerial imagery . This study offers the first radiometric assessment of WorldView 2 and RapidEye over a coastal system revealing inherent calibration issues in shorter wavelengths of WorldView 2 . Both platforms demonstrated as much as 97 agreement with aerial estimates despite differing resolutions . Thus calibration issues in WorldView 2 did not appear to interfere with classification accuracy but could be problematic if estimating biomass . The image processing routine developed here offers a reproducible workflow for WorldView 2 and RapidEye imagery which was tested in two additional coastal systems . This approach may become platform independent as more sensors become available .

@highlight A reproducible WorldView and RapidEye processing regime was developed for seagrass.
@highlight WorldView 2 had disagreement positive bias in shorter wavelengths against field data.
@highlight RapidEye had lower overall disagreement slight positive bias compared to field data.
@highlight WorldView 2 RapidEye classification had 97 agreement with aerial photointerpretation.
