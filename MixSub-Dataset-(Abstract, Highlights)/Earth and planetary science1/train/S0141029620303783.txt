 The hollow circular steel tubes support the permanent and construction loads of several upper floors during the construction of a high rise building structure before the concrete is filled into the steel tubes to form circular concrete filled double steel tubular columns . The preloads acting on the steel tubes may cause a marked reduction in the performance of slender CFDST columns . This paper presents a numerical modeling technique underlying the method of fiber elements for quantifying the behavior of circular slender CFDST beam columns loaded eccentrically with preloads acting on the hollow steel tubes . The numerical model considers the concrete confinement second order effects initial geometric imperfection deformations induced by preloads as well as geometric and material nonlinearities . The dynamic nonlinear equilibrium functions are solved using efficient computational solution algorithms developed . The validation of the numerical modeling technique is made by comparing computations with existing results obtained by experiments and finite element analyses . The influences of preloads on the structural behavior of slender CFDST beam columns with various important parameters are investigated by means of utilizing the developed computer model . It is shown that the numerical modeling method is an efficient computational simulation and design tool for slender CFDST columns including preloads .
