 Limnologists often adhere to a discretized view of waterbodiesthey classify them divide them into zones promote discrete management targets and use research tools experimental designs and statistical analyses focused on discretization . By offering useful shortcuts this approach to limnology has profoundly benefited the way we understand manage and communicate about waterbodies . But the research questions and the research tools in limnology are changing rapidly in the era of big data with consequences for the relevance of our current discretization schemes . Here I examine how and why we discretize and argue that selectively rethinking the extent to which we must discretize gives us an exceptional chance to advance limnology in new ways . To help us decide when to discretize I offer a framework that can be used to compare the usefulness of various discretization approaches to an alternative which relies less on discretization . This framework together with a keen awareness of discretizations advantages and disadvantages may help limnologists benefit from the ongoing information explosion .
