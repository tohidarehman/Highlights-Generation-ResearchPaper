 Effective sludge treatment with bioenergy production is attracting increasing interests as large quantities of waste activated sludge are produced during the wastewater treatment . In this study a new biotechnical process for converting the WAS alkaline fermentation liquor into valuable easy separated medium chain fatty acids through chain elongation was investigated which may provide a new insight into sludge treatment . In the process ethanol was served as the electron donor and WASAFL were main electron acceptors . The MCFAs productions were investigated under three different ED to EA ratios . The result showed that MCFAs production was increased from 2.880.01 to 5.280.18g COD L with the increase of ED to EA ratio . However the highest MCFA selectivity was achieved at 72.9 when the ED to EA ratio was 1 1 . The decrease in the selectivity at high ED EA ratio is mainly due to the production of higher alcohol . The thermodynamic analysis confirmed all CE processes for MCFAs production from WASAFL were exothermic reactions with the spontaneity and energy release of the reactions increased with the ethanol level . The microbial community analysis showed that the relative abundances of
