 This work evaluated the formation of transformation products during the degradation of diazepam by a solar photo Fenton process . Six TPs were identified three of them for the first time . After elucidation of the TPs a new cheap fast and easy method was employed to extract and preconcentrate DZP and its TPs using dispersive liquid liquid microextraction . The method was optimized using factorial and Doehlert designs with the best results obtained using acetonitrile as disperser solvent and chloroform as extraction solvent with volumes of 1000 and 650 L respectively . When DZP degradation was performed in ultrapure water the extraction preconcentration of DZP and its TPs by DLLME was very similar to the results obtained using a traditional SPE method . However when hospital wastewater was used as the matrix more limited extraction efficiency was obtained using DLLME compared to SPE . Meanwhile all the TPs extracted by SPE were also extracted by the DLLME technique . Furthermore DLLME was much less expensive than SPE besides being faster easier and requiring only small amounts of organic solvents . This work reports a new and very important tool for the extraction and preconcentration of TPs formed during degradation using techniques such as advanced oxidation processes since without this step it would not be possible to identify all the TPs formed in some complex wastewater matrices .
