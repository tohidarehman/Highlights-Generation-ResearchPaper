 The nitrate concentration in groundwater has been increasing over time due to the intensive use of nitrogen fertilizer . Current nitrate removal technologies are restricted by the high operational cost or the inevitable secondary contaminations . This study proposed a two chamber sulfide driven denitrifying microbial electrochemical system to denitrify nitrate in its cathode chamber . Instead of conventional organic substrates sulfide is oxidized in the anode chamber to generate electrons for cathodic denitrification . Long term performance of this novel system was evaluated over 200 days of batch fed operation . With the assistance of anodic microorganisms sulfide can be directly oxidized to sulfate thus avoiding passivating the anode . Catalyzed by the cathodic microorganisms complete denitrification was realized with neither nitrite nor nitrous oxide accumulation . Benefiting from the electroautotrophic behavior of the functional microorganisms high electron utilization efficiencies were achieved 80 and 85 for the anode and the cathode respectively . Both observed electrode potentials and microbial analyses revealed that cytochrome
