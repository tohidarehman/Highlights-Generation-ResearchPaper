 For comprehensive insights into the effects of multiple disinfection regimes on antibiotic resistome in drinking water this study utilized metagenomic approaches to reveal the changing patterns of antibiotic resistance genes and bacterial community as well as their associations . A total of 297 ARGs within 17 types were detected in the drinking water and their total relative abundance ranged from 195.4924.85 to 626.3138.61 copies of ARGs per cell . The total ARG abundance was significantly increased after the antimicrobial resin and ultraviolet disinfection while significantly decreased after the ozone and chlorine O

@highlight ARGs within bacitracin multidrug and beta lactam were dominant in drinking water.

@highlight Persistent ARGs accounted for the majority of total ARGs during disinfection.
@highlight Bacterial communities shifted significantly after multiple disinfection strategies.
@highlight Fate of ARGs may relate to the survival ability of corresponding bacterial hosts.
