 This paper investigates the time dependent flexural capacity of recycled aggregate concrete beams . The long term properties of the RAC are first analyzed . In particular the development of the compressive strength is investigated and a prediction model is established . Then the stressstrain curves of the RAC and corroded reinforcement are randomly generated to evaluate the long term properties based on the statistical parameters . With the stressstrain curves the flexural capacity of the RAC beams is calculated by the finite element method and the results indicate that the numerical simulation is capable of predicting the flexural capacity of the RAC beams . Therefore a time dependent flexural capacity model of RAC beams is proposed based on the simulation results . Finally the predicted results demonstrate that the mean flexural capacity of the RAC beams decreases while the standard deviation increases with increasing service time . At a given time the flexural capacity follows a lognormal distribution indicating that it is a lognormal stochastic process during the service life .
