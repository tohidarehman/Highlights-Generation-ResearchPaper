 Structural failure of existing unreinforced masonry buildings when subjected to earthquake loading is often caused by the out of plane response of masonry walls . Their out of plane resistance could vary considerably depending on several factors such as boundary conditions vertical overburden and construction technique . Amongst the latter the cavity wall system originally introduced in Northwest Europe in the 19th century and then spread to several countries including USA Canada China Australia and New Zealand has been shown to be particularly vulnerable towards out of plane actions . In this work the use of the Applied Element Method was investigated and subsequently considered for reproducing the experimentally observed out of plane shake table response of unreinforced masonry full scale cavity wall specimens subjected to both one way and two way bending . Finally given the adequate results obtained and aimed at investigating further both potential limits and actual capabilities of the adopted modelling strategy the latter was also extended to the simulation of the dynamic out of plane governed failure mode of a full scale building specimen tested up to complete collapse .

@highlight Applied Element Method models validated against tests on cavity wall systems.
@highlight Dynamic response of out of plane loaded masonry specimens adequately captured.
@highlight Actual crack propagation explicitly represented until up full collapse.
@highlight Simplified assumptions introduced for decreasing analysis time.
@highlight Potential limits and actual capabilities of the adopted model widely discussed.
