 Pesticides are frequently detected in surface waters sometimes at levels exceeding ecotoxicological guidelines . We screened for almost 100 pesticides in 32 streams from intense agricultural areas in Southern Sweden in concert with water chemistry parameters . In addition we investigated the communities of benthic macroinvertebrates biofilm nematodes and algae and calculated multiple bioassessment metrics . The number of pesticides found in each stream ranged between 2 and 52 but the sum of Toxic Units for the mixtures was generally low and exceeded the European Uniform Principles only in a single sample for algae and in 2 of the samples for

@highlight 32 agricultural streams in Sweden were screened for pesticides.
@highlight Between 2 52 pesticides were found per stream albeit mostly at low concentrations.
@highlight Biological indices showed generally good moderate status of the streams.
@highlight Nematode species composition was correlated to pesticide toxic units for
@highlight Diatom genus composition was affected by eutrophication not pesticides.
