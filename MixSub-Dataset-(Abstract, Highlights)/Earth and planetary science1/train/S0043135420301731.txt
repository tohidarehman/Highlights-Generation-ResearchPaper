 Oxidation is a widely used method in drinking water treatment to mitigate the membrane fouling caused by the natural organic matters from the surface water during ultra filtration and nano filtration processes and H

@highlight Fenton reaction at neutral pH by CFPN and H
@highlight CFPN could create an acidic microenvironment for catalysis at neutral pH.
@highlight NOM were carboxylated hydroxylated by low dose of H
@highlight and CFPN.
@highlight Carboxylation hydroxylation of NOM decreased membrane fouling.
