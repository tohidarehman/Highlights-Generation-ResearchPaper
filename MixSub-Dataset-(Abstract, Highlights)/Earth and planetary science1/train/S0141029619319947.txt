 This article presents a novel inverse method for identification of a space and time dependent load applied to a two dimensional viscoelastic solid . Measured strains at several points are considered as sampling quantities . An improved meshfree radial point interpolation method is employed to solve the direct problem . The inverse problem is treated by an optimization approach where the cost function is described in terms of the differences between measured and computed strains . The damped Gauss Newton method is utilized to solve the inverse problem . A new approach for the sensitivity analysis based on direct differentiation of governing equations is presented . The Tikhonov regularization method is employed to eliminate the undesired oscillations of the solutions of the inverse problem . Using a method based on the condition number of the sensitivity matrix an appropriate configuration for sensors is determined . The effects of the location and the number of sensors on the accuracy of the identified loads are investigated . The robustness of the presented method to handle noisy measured data is investigated too .
