 The occurrence temporal variation and spatial variation of antibiotics in coastal bays and estuaries worldwide are not well documented or understood . Fifteen target antibiotics within the five classes of lactams amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides were measured during the summer and winter in the water of Jiaozhou Bay in China which is a semi enclosed urbanized bay . Fourteen antibiotics were detected thus demonstrating the widespread occurrence of their residues in the bay . The total antibiotic concentration ranged from 71.8ng

@highlight The urbanized bay was heavily contaminated by amoxicillin and fluoroquinolones.
@highlight Total antibiotic concentrations were 71.8 840ng
@highlight for the estuarine water and 38.7 181ng
@highlight for the bay water.
@highlight Total antibiotic concentrations in the bay water were significantly higher in winter than in summer.
@highlight Spatiotemporal changes in antibiotics were driven by their sources and runoff dilution.
@highlight Amoxicillin and enrofloxacin presented high risks to algae in the urbanized bay.
