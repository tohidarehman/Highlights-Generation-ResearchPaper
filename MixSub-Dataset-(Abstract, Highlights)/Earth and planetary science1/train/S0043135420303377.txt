 In order to improve the dissolved organic matter removal efficiency an electro hybrid ozonation coagulation system was developed in this study in which the electro coagulation and ozonation occurred simultaneously in one integrated unit . Higher removal efficiency was observed for the E HOC process compared with those of EC ozonation and pre ozonation EC process for the treatment of wastewater treatment plant effluent and ibuprofen . 58.6 dissolved organic carbon removal efficiency was achieved in the E HOC process for the treatment of WWTP effluent at optimal operational condition current density 15mA cm

@highlight The E HOC showed higher organic removal than EC ozonation and pre ozonation EC.
@highlight Synergistic effects between ozone and coagulants SOC are involved in the E HOC.
@highlight The peroxone and SOC effects played almost equal major role in the E HOC at pH 5.
@highlight The SOC effects can further improve the ROS generation in the E HOC process.
