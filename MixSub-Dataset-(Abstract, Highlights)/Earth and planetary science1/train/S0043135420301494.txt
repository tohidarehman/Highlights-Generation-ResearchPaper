 Operational and financial constraints challenge effective removal of natural organic matter and specifically disinfection by product precursors at remote and or small sites . Granular activated carbon is a widely used treatment option for such locations due to its relatively low maintenance and process operational simplicity . However its efficacy is highly dependent on the media capacity for the organic matter which in turn depends on the media characteristics .

@highlight Impact of GAC media pore size distribution on THM and HAA formation potential FP.
@highlight 8 GAC media and both adsorption isotherm microcolumn tests on raw treated water.
@highlight Correlations of capacity vs pore volume across different pore size ranges produced.
@highlight No selectivity of DBP FP observed for any of the media tested.
@highlight Strongest correlation of capacity observed for 510nm pore size range.
