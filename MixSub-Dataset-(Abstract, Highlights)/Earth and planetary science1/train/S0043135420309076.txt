 Magnetite is known to exhibit high catalytic reactivity in Fenton like reactions merely at low pH conditions . Here we report the association of Cu

@highlight Cu
@highlight can synergistically activate PDS with magnetite to generate radicals.
@highlight Synergistic activation of PDS is effective to degrade contaminants in groundwater.
@highlight The adsorbed Cu
@highlight is reduced by the structural Fe II to generate Cu
@highlight Stability of Cu
@highlight is enhanced on magnetite surface at pH 7 and higher.
@highlight The generated Cu
@highlight on magnetite surface contributes to PDS activation.
