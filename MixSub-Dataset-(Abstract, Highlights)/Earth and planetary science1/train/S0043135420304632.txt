 Waterborne enteric viruses are an emerging cause of disease outbreaks and represent a major threat to global public health . Enteric viruses may originate from human wastewater and can undergo rapid transport through aquatic environments with minimal decay . Surveillance and source apportionment of enteric viruses in environmental waters is therefore essential for accurate risk management . However individual monitoring of the 100 enteric viral strains that have been identified as aquatic contaminants is unfeasible . Instead viral indicators are often used for quantitative assessments of wastewater contamination viral decay and transport in water . An ideal indicator for tracking wastewater contamination should be easy to detect and quantify source specific resistant to wastewater treatment processes and persistent in the aquatic environment with similar behaviour to viral pathogens . Here we conducted a comprehensive review of 127 peer reviewed publications to critically evaluate the effectiveness of several viral indicators of wastewater pollution including common enteric viruses the pepper mild mottle virus and gut associated bacteriophages Type II III FRNA phages and phages infecting human

@highlight Human mastadenoviruses are robust indicators for human associated pollution in water.
@highlight  associated phages and crAssphage are promising indicators.
@highlight Multiple indicators should be used to assess wastewater treatment efficiency.
@highlight Survival and abundance of indicator viruses should be further assessed.
