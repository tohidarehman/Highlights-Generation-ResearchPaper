 Many cities are confronted with both water scarcity and urban flooding as centralized water infrastructures becoming increasingly inadequate in a changing climate . Decentralized infrastructures like rainwater harvesting can ease both issues . Yet most studies find RWH offers limited infrastructure capacity at high cost . Previous assessments however fail to consider two critical advantages multi functionality and high adaptability . By improving the incorporation of these advantages in our analysis of 1.06 million buildings with distinct design and water demand characteristics and 20 year hourly precipitation records in New York City we demonstrate contrary to existing studies that strategically designed financed and implemented rooftop RWH systems in all or a subset of the buildings can meet large scale infrastructure development needs for water supply and stormwater management . RWH implementation featuring public private partnerships in 4396 of the buildings can serve 1729 of the citys non drinking water demands while reducing the public expenditure per unit of water supply by 1385 . The distributed citywide RWH implementations prevent 3556 of rooftop runoff from entering the sewage system rivers and or waterways per month with observed rooftop runoff reductions as high as 90 for a single rain event .

@highlight RWH systems are flexible for siting sizing and financing across the heterogeneous urban area.
@highlight Consistent water economy assessments of RWH based on a diverse stock of 1.06 million buildings.
@highlight Citywide RWH strategically funded by public private partnerships reduces public expenditure.
@highlight Large scale RWH can be a profitable climate change adaptation strategy for a major city.
