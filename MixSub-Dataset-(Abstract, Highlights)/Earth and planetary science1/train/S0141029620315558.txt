 Bridge expansion joint can accommodate the deformation under the effects of vehicle load and temperature . Fatigue damage readily occurs because it is directly subjected to repeated load . In this paper fatigue and static loading tests were conducted on modular bridge expansion joint . This is an innovative type of shallow buried modular bridge expansion joint and the anchoring depth is reduced by 40 50 compared with traditional ones . The reduced overall height can well adapt to the slide shutter rapid construction method in practical engineering . A loading device was designed to simulate vertical and horizontal load . The load deflection relationship after fatigue loading were discussed . The fatigue crack types crack initiation locations failure criteria and fatigue failure modes of MBEJs were also studied . Following that a finite element model was established to calculate the internal force of welded connections . Structural analysis on MBEJs was used to calculate the stress range within center beam and support bars under the test conditions . A theoretical fatigue performance assessment method on MBEJs was introduced which is based on the nominal stress method and a linear Miner damage accumulation rule . The theoretical prediction agreed well with the experimental observations .
