 Numerous experimental studies have identified a multi step reaction mechanism to control arsenite oxidation by manganese oxides . The studies highlighted the importance of edge sites and intermediate processes e.g . surface passivation by reaction products . However the identified reaction mechanism and controlling factors have rarely been evaluated in a quantitative context . In this study a process based modeling framework was developed to delineate and quantify the relative contributions and rates of the different processes affecting As oxidation by Mn oxides . The model development and parameterization were constrained by experimental observations from literature studies involving environmentally relevant Mn oxides at circumneutral pH using both batch and stirred flow reactors . Our modeling results highlight the importance of a transitional phase solely evident in the stirred flow experiments where As oxidation gradually shifts from fast reacting Mn to slowly reacting Mn edge sites . The relative abundance of these edge sites was the most important factor controlling the oxidation rate whereas surface passivation restricted oxidation only in the stirred flow experiment . The Mn edge sites were demonstrated to play a crucial role in the oxidation and therefore in controlling the long term fate of As . This study provided an improved understanding of Mn oxide reactivity and the significance in the cycling of redox sensitive metals in the environment .
