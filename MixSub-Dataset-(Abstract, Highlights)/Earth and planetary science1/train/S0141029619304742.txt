 A common problem of concrete bridges is corrosion damages of the steel reinforcement . The related loss of capacity as well as visual effects often require expensive and elaborate refurbishment or even reconstruction . To overcome these drawbacks the application of non corrosive fiber reinforced polymer reinforcement in concrete structures has been established and investigated throughout the last three decades . The successful application of prestressed carbon fiber reinforced polymer reinforcement in bridge constructions was demonstrated by several projects realized in the United States and Canada . Nevertheless despite the successful realization of these projects a widespread application has not yet been possible due to the lack of consistent and approved design regulations . In Germany and Europe the use of FRP reinforcement in bridge construction is even limited to individual cases and non prestressed reinforcement . Thus further investigations are necessary to develop a comprehensive guideline for the design of members with pre tensioned CFRP tendons in compliance with current codes of practice .

@highlight Development of a flexural design model for bridge girders pre tensioned with CFRP tendons.
@highlight Determination of the model uncertainty of the flexural model using a test databank of 33 flexural tests.
@highlight Reliability analysis of the proposed design model considering the reliability requirements of Eurocode 0.
@highlight Discussion of the results of the analysis and proposal of a safety factor for the CFRP tendons.
