 This study aims to extend and demonstrate the application of fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring the water quality of three differently operated full scale drinking water treatment plants located in the Shenzhen city . A ratio of fluorescent dissolved organic matter which describes relative changes in humic like to protein like fluorescence was used to explain mechanisms behind the physicochemical processes . The fluorescence components obtained through individual and combined parallel factor analysis modeling revealed the presence of humic like and protein like structures in the DOM . The C1 C2 ratio provided a direct relationship between the seasonal variations and DOM composition . Wet season generated DOM enriched with humic like fluorescence while dry season caused a higher release of protein like fluorescence . The fluorescence ratio presented unique patterns of DOM in treatment trains . The chemical pretreatment and disinfection unit processes showed a higher tendency to remove the humic like fluorescence . However the C1 C2 ratio increased during physical treatment processes such as coagulation precipitation and sand filtration indicating preferential removal of protein like fluorescence . The DOM composition in influent directly R

@highlight C1 C2 humic like protein like was directly influenced by seasonal variations.
@highlight Wet season produced DOM enriched with humic structures.
@highlight Dry season caused higher release of protein like fluorescence.
@highlight Chemical pretreatments units preferentially removed humic like fluorescence.
@highlight Protein like fluorescence was more prone to be removed in physical treatment units.
