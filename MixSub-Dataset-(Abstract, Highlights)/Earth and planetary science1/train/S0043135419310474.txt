 Bisphenol A and tetrabromobisphenol A endocrine disrupting compounds are of increasing concerns for many years . This paper presents the elimination of BPA under visible light irradiated solutions containing fulvic acid and MnSO

@highlight BPA was removed by soluble Mn III 
@highlight formed in VL FA Mn II system.
@highlight The co existence of TBBPA inhibited the transformation of BPA by Mn III .
@highlight Self oligomerization was the leading reaction pathway of BPA.
@highlight Proposed pathways of oxidation of BPA were consistent with theoretical calculations.
