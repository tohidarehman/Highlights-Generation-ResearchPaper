 The use of geopolymers has spread over the last 60years as an alternative to traditional cementitious systems due to their environmental benefits and mechanical properties for construction . Nowadays the state of the art on reinforced geopolymer concrete has focused on the micro scale analysis of the materials but it has vaguely dabbled into the macro scale context . This research experimentally assessed the shear behavior of geopolymer concrete panels that may be promising for construction of low rise and low cost housing . The parametric testing program included diagonal tension tests of 27 panels built with three different concrete types and three shear reinforcement ratios . The measured response of the specimens is compared in terms of cracking patterns shear capacity and drift demands . Overall results indicated that the shear capacity of panels mainly depends on the concrete type but it is slightly governed by the reinforcement ratios . Furthermore the program contributes towards developing new provisions for code based structural design of geopolymer concrete walls as an environmentally friendly construction option .

@highlight Shear strength of geopolymer panels is 12 higher than cement panels.
@highlight Drifts capacities for commercial and alternative silicate geopolymer panels are 0.45 and 0.20 .
@highlight Alternative silicate from rice husk ash reduces 33 the shear drift of cement panels.
@highlight Geopolymer concrete could be reliable for construction of low rise shear walls.
