 Environmental risk assessment increasingly relies on speciation modeling of bioavailability . Heavy metals are the most prevalent pollutants globally and dissolved organic matter plays an important role in speciation and bioavailability of heavy metals . Due to the variation of DOM properties in natural aquatic systems improvements to the standard one size fits all approach to modeling metal DOM interactions are needed for ERA . In this study we investigate variations in DOM and lead DOM binding in Lake Tai a large impacted lake in eastern China that is characterized by a complex drainage network and is an important water resource at a regional level and we assess implications of our findings within the context of ERA needs . In our study DOM in water samples collected from across the 2 400km

@highlight Harmful algal blooms cause large regional variations in DOC composition and reactivity.
@highlight Metal reactivity can be predicted by water quality and DOC parameters.
@highlight Findings support understanding of watershed processes across an extended complex drainage area.
@highlight Approach to parameter development would be fit for ERA applications at regional levels.
