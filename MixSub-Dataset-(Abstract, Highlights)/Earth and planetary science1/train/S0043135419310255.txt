 Anaerobic membrane bioreactor technology is being recognized as an appealing strategy for wastewater treatment however severity of membrane fouling inhibits its widespread implementations . This study engineered novel facultative quorum quenching consortiums coping with membrane fouling in AnMBRs with preliminary analysis for their quorum quenching performances . Herein Acyl homoserine lactones based quorum sensing in a lab scale AnMBR initially revealed that N Hexanoyl

@highlight Higher growth rate using AHLs than acetate endowed FQQs with high QQ performance.
@highlight FQQs degraded wide range of AHLs.
@highlight FQQs especially FQQ C6 and FQQ 10 significantly retarded EPS production.
@highlight FQQ C6 reduced membrane fouling by 2 times.
@highlight in FQQ C6 and FQQ 10 played a crucial role in their QQ performance.
