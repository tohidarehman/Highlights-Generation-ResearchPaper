 Microbial regrowth during drinking water distribution can result in a variety of problems such as a deviating taste and odor and may even pose a risk to public health . Frequent monitoring is essential to anticipate events of biological instability and relevant microbial parameters for operational control of biostability of drinking water should be developed . Here online flow cytometry and derived biological metrics were used to assess the biological stability of a full scale drinking water tower during normal and disturbed flow regime . Pronounced operational events such as switching from drinking water source and seasonal changes were detected in the total cell counts and regrowth was observed despite the short hydraulic residence time of 68h . Based on the flow cytometric fingerprints the Bray Curtis dissimilarity was calculated and was developed as unambiguous parameter to indicate or warn for changing microbial drinking water quality during operational events . In the studied water tower drastic microbial water quality changes were reflected in the Bray Curtis dissimilarity which demonstrates its use as an indicator to follow up and detect microbial quality changes in practice . Hence the Bray Curtis dissimilarity can be used in an online setup as a straightforward parameter during full scale operation of drinking water distribution and combined with the cell concentration it serves as an early warning system for biological instability .
