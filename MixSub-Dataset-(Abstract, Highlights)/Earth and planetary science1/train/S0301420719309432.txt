 Mineral resources are vital for economic growth and maintaining quality of life . In order to maintain a steady adequate and sustainable supply of minerals it is important that appropriate policies exist at all levels of government . Sufficient information must be available to inform the land use planning process and the development of minerals supply strategies . An important first stage for improving the security of supply of minerals is to identify the locations of a country s mineral resources and estimate the quantities that may be present . Whilst the existence of resources does not mean that they will be extracted knowing what minerals can be found within a jurisdiction can facilitate the development of strategies for their sustainable management and to inform the negotiation of trade relationships .
