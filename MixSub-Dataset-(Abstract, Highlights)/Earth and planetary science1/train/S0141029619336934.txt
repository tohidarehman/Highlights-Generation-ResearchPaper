 Several confinement methods using concrete casing steel jacketing and wrapping with Fibre Reinforced Polymer sheets are widely implemented to enhance the strength and ductility of reinforced concrete columns . Recently smart materials such as Shape Memory Alloys are utilized for repair and strengthening of RC columns . The SMAs exhibit unique thermo mechanical properties such as shape memory effect that enables the material to achieve high recovery stress and strain . Recent findings in the literature show the SME and high recovery stress of the SMA wires used to confine concrete columns significantly enhanced the strength and ductility performance of concrete . Realizing the potential of the SMA confinement technique this paper aims to present an analytical model to describe the behaviour of SMA confined RC columns subjected to uni axial compressive loads . Experimental data are compared against theoretically predicted results to validate the proposed analytical model . Results show the proposed analytical model predictions are in good agreement with the experimentally observed axial compressive response of SMA confined RC columns .
