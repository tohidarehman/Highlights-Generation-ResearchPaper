 Applications of digital agricultural services often require either farmers or their advisers to provide digital records of their field boundaries . Automatic extraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance on manual input of these records which is time consuming and would underpin the provision of remote products and services . The lack of current field boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing methods presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and local often arbitrary tuning . In this paper we propose a data driven robust and general method to facilitate field boundary extraction from satellite images . We formulated this task as a multi task semantic segmentation problem . We used ResUNet a a deep convolutional neural network with a fully connected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions and conditioned inference to identify 1 the extent of fields 2 the field boundaries and 3 the distance to the closest boundary . By asking the algorithm to reconstruct three correlated outputs the model s performance and its ability to generalise greatly improve . Segmentation of individual fields was then achieved by post processing the three model outputs

@highlight We extract field boundaries from Sentinel 2 data using a convolutional neural network.
@highlight High thematic and geometric accuracies were obtained using a composite image.
@highlight The same model generalised well across sensors resolution space and time.
@highlight Building consensus by averaging predictions from multiple dates improves accuracy.
