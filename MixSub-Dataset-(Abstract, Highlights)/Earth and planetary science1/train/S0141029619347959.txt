 The demand for lightweight materials in construction has become very popular due to its flexibility and economical importance . Cold formed steel beams and columns are used for provision of lightweight durable and cost efficient structures and its usage also helps to optimize the construction time . Cold formed steel section exhibits post buckling strength in which hot rolled section is deficient . However more theoretical background on design and behavior of cold form section is still required especially when it is subjected to axial loading . Thus this paper presents numerical and theoretical behavior of pin jointed cold formed steel column section under axial loading . The numerical modeling was done by using ABAQUS 6.10 software . Based on American Iron and Steel Institute specifications two types of sections were selected for single lipped channel and it was ensured that the selected chord spacing permits both moment of inertia about the major axis and minor axis are equal . The numerical and theoretical study were done using a varying batten number and section slenderness ratio . The ultimate loads were obtained under the two approaches for the lipped channel built up columns and were compared for the effective section proposed . From the results the prediction of buckling mode and the failure load of the column were found to be stable and approximately relevant to the FEM results from slenderness ratio ranging from 20 to 60 . Also flexural buckling of all column sections occurred about the axis parallel to the webs where there is an opportunity for composite action .

@highlight Flexural buckling of column sections occurs about the axis parallel to the webs.
@highlight Direct strength method predicts a stable buckling mode and failure load of columns.
@highlight Increase in slenderness ratio of column reduces its ultimate load carrying capacity.
