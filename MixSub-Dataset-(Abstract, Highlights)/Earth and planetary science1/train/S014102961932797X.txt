 In this study a novel prefabricated beam to column steel joint suitable for precast concrete structures was developed . The proposed steel joint with dampers could replace cast in situ concrete beam to column joints in precast concrete structures . Low yield point steel was selected for the damper to provide the energy dissipation capacity . The plastic hinge location of the beam can be controlled within the joint by the energy dissipation segments made of the LYP 100 steel . Compared with the monolithic joint the joint is easier to fabricate and take less time during construction while ensuring satisfactory construction quality . Experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the seismic performance of steel joints subjected to cyclic loading . The effects of the thickness of the non energy dissipation segments and the length of the EDS were investigated . The test results showed that the proposed steel joint exhibited better hysteretic performance and higher energy dissipation and ductility than a monolithic joint . The joints had sufficient initial stiffness . In addition an increase in the thickness of NEDS results in higher strength and lower energy dissipation of the PSJ specimens . The strength decreases and the energy dissipation increases with the increasing of the length of EDS .

@highlight A prefabricated steel joint for precast concrete structures was proposed.
@highlight Three PSJ specimens and a MJ specimen were cyclically tested.
@highlight Location of the plastic hinge in the beam was controlled.
@highlight The performance of PSJ specimens were improved due to the mild steel dampers.
