 Worldwide clinical data remain the gold standard for disease surveillance and tracking . However such data are limited due to factors such as reporting bias and inability to track asymptomatic disease carriers . Disease agents are excreted in the urine and feces of infected individuals regardless of disease symptom severity . Wastewater surveillance that is monitoring disease via human effluent represents a valuable complement to clinical approaches . Because wastewater is relatively inexpensive and easy to collect and can be monitored at different levels of population aggregation as needed wastewater surveillance can offer a real time cost effective view of a community s health that is independent of biases associated with case reporting . For SARS CoV 2 and other disease causing agents we envision an aggregate wastewater monitoring system at the level of a wastewater treatment plant and exploratory or confirmatory monitoring of the sewerage system at the neighborhood scale to identify or confirm clusters of infection or assess impact of control measures where transmission has been established . Implementation will require constructing a framework with collaborating government agencies public or private utilities and civil society organizations for appropriate use of data collected from wastewater identification of an appropriate scale of sample collection and aggregation to balance privacy concerns and risk of stigmatization with public health preservation and consideration of the social implications of wastewater surveillance .

@highlight Wastewater surveillance cheaper and less invasive than massive testing of individuals.
@highlight Useful early alert of viral circulation to prevent outbreaks and inform policy decisions.
@highlight Success of surveillance requires public legitimacy and trust of such measures.
