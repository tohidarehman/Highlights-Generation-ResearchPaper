 To monitor chalk cliff face along the Normandy coast which is prone to erosion we tested the potential of cliff face 3D reconstruction using pairs of images with high angle of incidence at different dates from the agile Pliades satellites . The verticality aspect of the cliff face brings difficulties in the 3D reconstruction process . Furthermore the studied area is challenging mainly because the cliff face is north oriented . Pliades images were acquired over several days with requested incidence angles until 40 . 3D reconstructions of the cliff face were compared using two software ASP and ERDAS IMAGINE . Our results are twofold . Firstly despite ASP provides denser point clouds than ERDAS IMAGINE ERDAS IMAGINE provides more reliable point clouds than ASP with a better spatial distribution over the cliff face and a better representation of the cliff face shape . Secondly the quality of 3D reconstructions depends mostly on the amount of noise from raw images and on the shadow intensity on the cliff face .

@highlight The potential of coastal cliff face 3D reconstruction using pairs of Pliades images with high angle of incidence is tested.
@highlight The cliff face 3D reconstruction is challenging in Normandy because of the subverticality of the cliffs and of the north oriented cliff face.
@highlight 3D reconstructions of the cliff face are compared using ASP and ERDAS IMAGINE.
@highlight ERDAS IMAGINE provides more reliable point clouds than ASP.
@highlight The amount of noise from raw images and the shadow intensity on the cliff face mostly explain the quality of 3D point cloud reconstructions.
