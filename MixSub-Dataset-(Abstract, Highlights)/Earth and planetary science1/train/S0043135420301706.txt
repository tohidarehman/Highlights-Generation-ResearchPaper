 Microplastics as an emerging class of pollutants has become a global concern and is receiving increasing attention . Interestingly microplastics are always in their ageing process when they enter the real environment . Our study investigated the ageing properties of polystyrene plastics in air pure water and seawater environments at 75C . A two dimensional Fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy analysis was used to better understand the ageing mechanism of the PS plastics . Based on the 2D COS analysis different ageing mechanisms were identified under different ageing conditions such as an ageing sequence of aged PS particle functional groups in air 1601 C

@highlight Microplastics were aged by air pure water and seawater on 75C.
@highlight The aging mechanism of PS were different under different aging conditions.
@highlight The adsorption capacities of PS were enhanced with the increase of aging degree.
@highlight The adsorption of PS on organic pollutants depend on its properties.
