 Sugarcane is a major crop for sugar and ethanol production and its area has increased substantially in tropical and subtropical regions in recent decades . Updated and accurate sugarcane maps are critical for monitoring sugarcane area and production and assessing its impacts on the society economy and the environment . To date no sugarcane mapping tools are available to generate annual maps of sugarcane at the field scale over large regions . In this study we developed a pixel and phenology based mapping tool to produce an annual map of sugarcane at 10 m spatial resolution by analyzing time series Landsat 7 8 Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 1 images during August 31 2017 July 1 2019 in Guangxi province China which accounts for 65 of sugarcane production of China . First we generated annual maps of croplands and other land cover types in 2018 . Second we delineated the cropping intensity for all cropland pixels in 2018 . Third we identified sugarcane fields in 2018 based on its phenological characteristics . The resultant 2018 sugarcane map has producer user and overall accuracies of 88 96 and 96 respectively . According to the annual sugarcane map in 2018 there was a total of 8940km

@highlight A sugarcane mapping tool was developed using time series Landsat and Sentinel 1 2.
@highlight Annual maps of sugarcane fields and phenology metrics at 10 m were developed.
@highlight Green up dates of sugarcane fields were monitored in time for planting management.
