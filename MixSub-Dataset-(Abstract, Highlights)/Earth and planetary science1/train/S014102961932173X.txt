 The neutral axis depth is adopted by many codes of practice as an indicator of flexural ductility to quantify moment redistribution in continuous prestressed concrete beams . Moment redistribution however does not only depend on ductility but also on differences in stiffness along the length of the beam . Therefore the effectiveness of using solely the neutral axis depth for redistribution quantification needs to be further evaluated . This study examines moment redistribution against neutral axis depth in two span PSC beams with external CFRP tendons by applying a validated finite element model . The main variable is the content of non prestressed reinforcement either at the positive or negative moment zone to generate varying stiffness differences between critical sections . The study shows that the use of neutral axis depth as a key parameter is inadequate when quantifying moment redistribution in these beams . Modifications of CSA BSI and EC2 equations are proposed by introducing a parameter reflecting the impact of stiffness difference . The proposed equations show much better fit to the actual redistribution than that provided by equations in current design codes .
