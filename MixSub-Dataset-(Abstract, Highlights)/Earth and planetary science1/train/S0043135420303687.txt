 Thermal stratification and mixing are important to the physicochemical composition of reservoirs and lakes and impact their water quality and biogeochemical cycles . However it remains unclear how thermal stratification and mixing process control the exchange of CO

@highlight Varying thermal structure control temporal variations of CO
@highlight emissions.
@highlight Thermal stratification limits CO
@highlight emission during summer.
@highlight Mixing processes stimulate CO
@highlight emissions during early winter.
