 An energy recovery technique using a high current bi directional dc dc converter for membrane capacitive de ionization of brackish waters is described and its performance assessed in a pilot scale prototype . The energy recovery system is shown to reduce the energy consumption of the pilot scale mCDI unit powered by photovoltaics and with battery storage by between 30 and 40 . Use of a stopped flow process also enables water recovery of up to 87 .

@highlight Energy recovery system reduces mCDI energy consumption by 3040 .
@highlight Energy usage by mCDI process of lower than 0.4kWh m3 achieved.
@highlight Total energy usage of 1.11.2kWh m3 achieved.
@highlight Use of a stopped flow discharge process enables water recovery of up to 87 .
