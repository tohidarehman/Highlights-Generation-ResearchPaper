 Floating offshore wind turbines have substantial potential to harness energy in deep water locations however compared to fixed bottom offshore wind turbines they also have more complicated dynamic behavior that may lead to larger structural loads . In this paper structural control using tuned liquid column dampers is applied to a tension leg platform type floating offshore wind turbine in order to improve the structural response and reliability of the system . A structural control module in the aero hydro servo elastic wind turbine simulator FASTv8 is developed that enables the analysis of passive orthogonal tuned liquid column dampers with variable cross sectional areas . Multi objective optimization using the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II is solved to provide an optimal Pareto front that can be used to select designs of the orthogonal TLCDs . With the optimal designs non linear fully coupled time marching simulations are conducted to evaluate the impacts of the orthogonal TLCDs on reducing fatigue and extreme loads . The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the orthogonal TLCDs on reducing the fore aft and side to side fatigue and extreme loadings .

@highlight TLCDs are placed orthogonally to dampen the fore aft and side to side motion of the turbine tower.
@highlight Design variable ranges are determined and used to solve a multi objective optimization problem.
@highlight The mass ratio has a significant impact on the TLCDs control performance.
@highlight The optimized orthogonal TLCDs can significantly reduce the fatigue and extreme loads.
