 The fibre beam element method has been widely used to investigate the behaviors of concrete filled steel tube columns for its high efficiency and accuracy . The existing models were generally developed or calibrated by using specimens with relatively small size in which the size effects were ignored or poorly incorporated . Additionally most existing FBE models focused on CFT stub columns . In this paper a new FBE model for nonlinear analysis of concentrically loaded stub and slender columns was proposed in which the size effects on the effective stress strain relationships of steel tube and core concrete were well incorporated . The proposed FBE models were then used to develop an ultimate strength model for the design of both stub and slender columns . A total of 1029 specimens assembled from 72 previous studies were used to verify the proposed models . The results suggested that the proposed FBE model performs quite well for both small and large size CFT stub columns and predicts the behaviors of slender columns with reasonable accuracy . Moreover the ultimate strength model developed based on the proposed FBE models was found to make satisfying prediction of test results .
