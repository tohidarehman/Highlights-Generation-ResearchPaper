 Poly and perfluoroalkyl substances are a wide group of environmentally persistent organic compounds of industrial origin which are of great concern due to their harmful impact on human health and ecosystems . Amongst long chain PFAS perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid are the most detected in the aquatic environment even though their use has been limited by recent regulations . Recently more attention has been posed on the short chain compounds due to their use as an alternative to long chain ones and to their high mobility in the water bodies . Therefore short chain PFAS have been increasingly detected in the environmental compartments . The main process investigated and implemented for PFAS removal is adsorption . However to date most adsorption studies have focused on synthetic water .

@highlight Most PFAS adsorption studies were carried out under unrealistic conditions.
@highlight Organic matter often improves long chain PFAS adsorption by aggregates formation.
@highlight Co existing OM reduces the short chain PFAS adsorption efficiency.
@highlight Short chain PFAS are better removed by anion exchange mechanism.
@highlight Regeneration of PFAS saturated adsorbents often needs harmful organic solvents.
