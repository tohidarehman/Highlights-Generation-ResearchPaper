 Soil salinity is one of the crucial factors which undermines agricultural production in the semi arid region . The study was attempted for the Vellore district one of the worst hit semi regions of Tamil Nadu by salinization . The Sentinel 1 data product of C band frequency was instrumental in the development of the model . In the present research a semi empirical dielectric model was proposed and its potential in demonstrating the rate of soil salinity was validated with in situ measurements under semi saturated conditions . The dielectric behavior of saline and non saline soil was simulated by investigating the paradigm of the parameters namely the backscattering coefficient of VV polarization soil texture and in situ dielectric constant in the three dimensional density space . The imaginary part of the dielectric constant was retrieved by simulating the dielectric loss from the partition observed between the dielectric constant of saline and non saline soils in the third dimension . The resultant product of the proposed model has achieved the best fit R

@highlight The dielectric behavior of soil was simulated in three dimensional density space.
@highlight The imaginary part of the dielectric constant was simulated from dielectric loss.
@highlight The imaginary part to quantify soil salinity over vegetated and bare surfaces.
@highlight The simulation is dependent on soil texture under a semi saturated state.
