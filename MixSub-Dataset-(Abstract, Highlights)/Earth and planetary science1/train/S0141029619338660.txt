 Despite the increasing popularity of modular buildings there are relatively few published case studies considering the overall structural responses to wind and earthquake load . As a result there is limited structural performance data for the overall behaviour of modular buildings which in turn impedes the development of appropriate design standards . At the same time different inter module connections exhibit different structural behaviours and the overall response of a building assembled from interconnected modules may be influenced by the inter module connection . However the structural behaviours of inter module connections in modular building structures subjected to lateral dynamic loads are not well known in the existing literature . This paper therefore presents a numerical investigation into the overall structural behaviour of a selected case study building . In particular the moment rotation and force displacement behaviours of the inter module connection were simplified and incorporated in the overall structural model . The numerical technique was verified by comparison with a previous study and the verified technique was then extended to the selected six storey case study building . The results showed that the overall response was affected by the inter module connection stiffness especially the translational stiffness in the along load direction .

@highlight A numerical model is developed to predict the overall behaviour of a modular building.
@highlight Wind and earthquake loads are considered while design methods are compared.
@highlight Inter module connection stiffness significantly affects the overall building response.
@highlight Translational shear stiffness has greater effect than rotational stiffness.
@highlight Development of a more accurate model for the shear behaviour is recommended.
