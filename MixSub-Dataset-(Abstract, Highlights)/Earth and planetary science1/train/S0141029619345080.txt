 Accurate prediction of buildings response subjected to earthquakes makes possible to evaluate building performance . To this end we leverage the recent advances in deep learning and develop a physics guided convolutional neural network for data driven structural seismic response modeling . The concept is to train a deep PhyCNN model based on limited seismic inputoutput datasets and physics constraints and thus establish a surrogate model for structural response prediction . Available physics can provide constraints to the network outputs alleviate overfitting issues reduce the need of big training datasets and thus improve the robustness of the trained model for more reliable prediction . The surrogate model is then utilized for fragility analysis given certain limit state criteria . In addition an unsupervised learning algorithm based on K means clustering is also proposed to partition the datasets to training validation and prediction categories so as to maximize the use of limited datasets . The performance of PhyCNN is demonstrated through both numerical and experimental examples . Convincing results illustrate that PhyCNN is capable of accurately predicting buildings seismic response in a data driven fashion without the need of a physics based analytical numerical model . The PhyCNN paradigm also outperforms non physics guided neural networks .
