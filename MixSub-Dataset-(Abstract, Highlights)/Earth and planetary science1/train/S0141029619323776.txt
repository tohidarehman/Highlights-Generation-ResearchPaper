 When using headed bars the distributive relationship of anchorage force between reinforcement and headed bars is crucial . This study conducted pull out tests on 120 specimens categorized into 24 groups with a cross sectional area of 150150mm and the parameters considered were diameter

@highlight 120 specimens with different parameters were tested.
@highlight Experimental phenomena were explained and verifying the accuracy of the programs by test data.
@highlight The concept of stable development length was proposed and the fitting equation was given.
@highlight The distributive relationship between
@highlight and
@highlight was found at reinforcement yield moment.
