 The influence of the pre ozonization on the formation of disinfection by products upon chlorination for fresh waters containing three common cyanobacteria namely Microcystis aeruginosa Anabaena aequalis and Oscillatoria tenuis at 10 000cells mL is reported . Specifically the formation carbonaceous DBPs haloacetic acids and haloketones and nitrogenous DBPs and trichloronitromethane has been determined as a function of the pH . The main C DBPs were THMs and HAAs with negligible formation of HKs accompanied by minor amounts of HANs in the absence of TCNM . Pre ozonation of the aqueous cyanobacteria suspensions does not allow a control over all the DBPs . In fact pre ozonation increases THM formation and generates TCNM has low influence on HAAs and only decreases the formation of HANs . The overall conclusion of this work is that pre ozonation of waters containing a relatively low concentration of common fresh water cyanobacteria is not an appropriate process to decrease DBP formation from chlorine . Cyanobacteria removal from raw water before chlorination or ozonation should reduce DBP formation .

@highlight Microcystis Anabaena and Oscillatoria cyanobacteria are important DBP precursors.
@highlight THMs and HAAs are the main chlorinated C DBPs and HANs the N DBPs.
@highlight Cyanobacteria ozonation increases THMs content and favours chloropicrin formation.
@highlight Cyanobacteria ozonation increases THMs produce chloropicrin and does not reduce HAA.
@highlight Pre ozonation of cyanobacteria decreases HAN.
