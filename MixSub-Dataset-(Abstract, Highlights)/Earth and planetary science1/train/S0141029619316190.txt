 To study the compressive bearing capacity and stiffness of welded hollow spherical joints with H shaped steel member axial compression test was conducted on eight specimens of WHS HSM joints . By verifying the correctness of the numerical model the parametric analyses were done considering the following factors such as the welded hollow sphere diameter the wall thickness of the welded hollow sphere and the height and width of the H shaped steel member . The calculation methods of the compressive capacity and axial stiffness of WHS HSM were proposed . The results show that the failure mode of the joints under axial compressive load is the hollow spheres concave failure starting from the flange edge of H beam . Under axial compressive load the joints show good ductility . The bearing capacity and initial axial stiffness of the joints are positively related with the wall thickness of the welded hollow sphere
