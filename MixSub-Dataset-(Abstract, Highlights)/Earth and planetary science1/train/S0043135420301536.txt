 Full scale aerobic granular sludge technology under the trade name Nereda has been implemented for municipal as well as industrial wastewater treatment . Owing to the operational reactor procedures two types of waste aerobic granular sludge can be clearly distinguished 1 aerobic granular sludge selection discharge and 2 aerobic granular sludge mixture . This study systematically compared the anaerobic biodegradability of AGS SD and AGS RTC under mesophilic conditions . Results were further compared with the anaerobic conversion of waste activated sludge as well as primary sludge from full scale municipal wastewater treatment plants . Analysis showed similar chemical characteristics for AGS SD and PS which were both characterized by a high carbohydrate content mainly cellulosic fibres . Concurrently AGS RTC exhibited chemical properties close to WAS both characterized by a relatively high protein content which were individually 49814 and 38915mg g VS sludge . AGS SD was characterized by a high biochemical methane potential 29615mL CH

@highlight Anaerobic digestion of Nereda waste aerobic granular sludge was carried out.
@highlight Two Nereda waste aerobic granular sludge types had distinct digestion kinetics.
@highlight High cellulosic fibres content was observed in selection discharge sludge.
@highlight Protein and carbohydrate in aerobic granular sludge mixture were hardly digested.
@highlight Mechanically destroying granules structure did not affect overall digestibility.
