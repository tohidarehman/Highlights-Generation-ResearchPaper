 Indicators of landscape condition should be sensitive and specific to environmental change and provide early warning detection of ncipient changes . We assessed a suite of five spectral metrics derived from Landsat 5 TM imagery spanning a decade to quantify ecosystem condition in the ridge slough mosaic of the Everglades . These included the normalized difference vegetation index the same index using green instead of red band as the visible reference the normalized difference water index the simple ratio of NIR and red bands and the moisture stress index . Mean and variance from pure ridge or slough pixels were quantified for twentyfour 25km blocks across a gradient of hydrologic and ecological condition . Metrics were compared with field measures of landscape condition from block scale soil elevation surveys which capture dramatic spatial gradients between conserved and degraded locations . Elevationbased measures of landscape condition validated as diagnostic in previous work included soil elevation bi modality BI

@highlight Spectral metrics can diagnose the spatial extent and severity of ecological change.
@highlight Most metrics are lagging indicators indicating poor early warning detection.
@highlight Multivariate models outperformed univariate models for predicting degradation.
