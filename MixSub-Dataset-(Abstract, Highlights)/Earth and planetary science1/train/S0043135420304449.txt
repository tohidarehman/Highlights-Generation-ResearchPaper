 The main route of transmission of the human coronaviruses and presumably also of the new pandemic SARS CoV 2 is via droplets and close contacts however their fecal elimination also suggests the possible spread via water . A scientific literature search was thus carried out to highlight the current state of the art and knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus in water . Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria and considered heterogeneous purposes detection methods and types of water .

@highlight Only 22 heterogeneous studies addressed Human CoV or surrogates in waters.
@highlight Without better knowledge waterborne circulation of SARS CoV 2 cannot be excluded.
@highlight Urgent research on coronavirus presence and persistence in the environment is needed.
