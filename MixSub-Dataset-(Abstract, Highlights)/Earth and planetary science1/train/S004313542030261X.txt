 Free nitrous acid has been recently reported to be an effective and eco friendly inactivator for waste activated sludge while the limited decomposition of the extracellular polymeric substance matrix hampers resource recovery from WAS . This work employed peracetic acid to assist FNA and explored the contribution of co pretreatment to hydrogen recovery in a prefermentation bioelectrolysis cascading system . The results showed that co pretreatment led to approximately 8.8 and 20.4 increases in the exfoliation of particulate proteins and carbohydrates respectively from tightly bound EPS over that of sole FNA pretreatment . Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis verified that the synergistic effect of FNA PAA and various generated free radicals was the essential process . This effect further promoted the accumulation of volatile fatty acids after 96h of prefermentation and the peak concentration in co pretreated WAS was approximately 2.5 fold that in sole FNA pretreated WAS . Subsequently the cascading utilization of organics in the bioelectrolysis step contributed to efficient hydrogen generation . A total of 10.80.3mg H
