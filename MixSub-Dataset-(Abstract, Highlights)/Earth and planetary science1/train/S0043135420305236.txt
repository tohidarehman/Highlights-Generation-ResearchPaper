 This work reports the novel application of an Fe based 2D metalorganic framework prepared with 2 2 bipyridine 5 5 dicarboxylate as organic linker as highly active catalyst for heterogeneous photoelectro Fenton treatment of the lipid regulator bezafibrate in a model matrix and urban wastewater . Well dispersed 2D structures were successfully synthesized and their morphological physicochemical and photocatalytic properties were assessed . UV Vis PEF using an IrO
