 The growing interest in sustainable buildings has inspired the improvement of timber structures in the construction market . As a raw material wood may present natural defects that can cause changes in its mechanical properties such as strength reduction as well as brittle failure under tension which limit the application of this material in construction . In recent decades synthetic fibers with high tensile strength are available as construction material and research to evaluate the efficiency of synthetic fibers and adhesive composites as a reinforcement for glued laminated timber beams has been carried out . This paper deals with an experimental study applying bending tests to glue laminated timber beams made of

@highlight This work investigated timber beams strengthened by Vectran FRP reinforcement.
@highlight Vectran is a high performance synthetic fiber whose application as reinforcement is little explored.
@highlight Reinforced glue laminated timber beams from reforested wood of
@highlight are tested in bending.
@highlight Vectran fibers provides increase in the initial stiffness and the ultimate load.
@highlight The use of fibers changes the failure mode of the timber from brittle to ductile.
