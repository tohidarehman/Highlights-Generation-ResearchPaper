 Currently resource efficiency is getting more importance due to a build up of disposed waste in landfills . The closed raw material cycle is an important topic in industries as it is economic and pollute free . This scenario applies to both existing and innovative future materials . To tackle the pollute emission of vehicles multimaterial and hybrid structures are gaining importance in lightweight construction . Hybrid structures that are a combination of metallic materials and carbon fibre reinforced plastics are often used for lightweight structures . In the present work a method is presented that can separate hybrid structures using thermal process so that they can be recycled separately . The thermal process was investigated with the help of different heating techniques such as the furnace induction resistance and infrared on the hybrid structures . Corresponding process windows and the boundary conditions for respective heating techniques are investigated in the current work . The influence of various heating techniques on the separation process is validated using microscopic results .

@highlight Different heating methods for separating hybrid compounds was investigated.
@highlight The process window are in the range of 275C to 400C with in 15min.
@highlight Recycling concept for the separating of Hybrid Structure was developed.
