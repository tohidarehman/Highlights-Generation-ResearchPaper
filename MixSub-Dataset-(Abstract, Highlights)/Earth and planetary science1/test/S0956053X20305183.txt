 Packaging waste production especially single use containers is exerting detrimental effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including human health . To internalise the externalities associated with single use containers different instruments including a deposit refund scheme have been operationalised in many countries . Therefore DRS is introduced in Scotland to reduce plastic litters by increasing recycling rates and incentivising pro environmental behavioural change . This study addresses the complexity of single use plastic containers by analysing consumers perceptions regarding the introduction of DRS in Scotland . Using 940 comments from the BBC Have Your Say messageboard this study adopts sentiment analysis to understand consumers opinions about the introduction and implementation of DRS in Scotland . Findings suggest that a UK wide scheme that is similar in terms of operations and structure is required for DRS to be successful . While consumers knowledge and opinions about DRS are mixed the efficacy of DRS including its relevance is questioned and raises doubts about its contribution to sustainability . The findings imply the need for UK countries to negotiate and collaborate on appropriate and attractive interventions in addressing post consumer single use plastic containers . The implications of the findings for policy and practice especially in improving the operations of DRS are further discussed .

@highlight Online platforms are now an effective tool for marketing and policy development.
@highlight Consumers emotions and opinions are important for interventions to be effective.
@highlight Clarity about DRS including its operations is required to enhance participation.
@highlight A UK wide scheme with similar operations and structure should be introduced.
@highlight DRS may not contribute to sustainability rather it might increase pollution.
