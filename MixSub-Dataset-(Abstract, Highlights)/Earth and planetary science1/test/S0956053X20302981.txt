 It is a fact that plastic packages are widely used over the world . This large scale consumption has resulted in a decrease of the initial resources used to manufacture the packages and has made it more of a challenge to dispose the increased amount of solid plastic wastes . Plastic waste is one of the most significant types of waste materials in the world owing to its non degradation and low biodegradability . The presence of large quantities of plastic waste has led to a number of environmental problems . Various researches have already been conducted to find a safe and environmentally friendly solution for the disposal of plastic wastes . Recently different types of plastic have been incorporated into concrete mixtures because of its long service life and lower weight in order to eliminate or reduce environmental problems . This paper presents an overview of previously published research papers which is investigating the use of different types of plastic wastes in concrete mixtures . In addition a global view is summarized regarding the effects of plastic waste on fresh mechanical thermal and acoustical properties of concrete .

@highlight Plastic wastes incorporated as aggregate and fibers in cementitious materials.
@highlight Development of new possibilities for the use of plastic solid waste in concrete.
@highlight The workability of concrete decrease due to high porosity of plastic waste.
@highlight The mechanical properties of concrete decrease by increasing the waste ratio.
@highlight The flexural strength and ductility increase by adding the fiber plastic waste.
