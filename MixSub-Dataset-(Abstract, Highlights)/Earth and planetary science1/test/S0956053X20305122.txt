 The present work explored the production of volatile fatty acids through the anaerobic co digestion of sewage sludge and cheese whey . Two batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of the substrate mixing ratio and the initial pH on the acidogenic fermentation of SS with CW at different temperatures . The first batch experiment showed that a decrease of the SS proportion in the co digestion with CW led to a higher degree of acidification observing a synergistic effect at a SS CW mixing ratio of 25 75 . In the second batch experiment three temperatures and two initial pH were studied at SS60 CW40 and SS25 CW75 substrate mixing ratios . Maximum degrees of acidification of 56 and 73 were achieved at 50C and initial pH of 5.5 for the SS60 CW40 and SS25 CW75 substrate mixing ratios respectively . Finally the performance of a semi continuous reactor was demonstrated at laboratory scale reactor . Different hydraulic retention times pH and the effect of a thermal pre treatment of the SS was studied . The maximum degree of acidification in the lab scale reactor was 45 at 37C HRT of 20days and pH of 5.5 . Under these conditions the volatile fatty acids profile was dominated by butyric and acetic acids .
