 This paper presents a research project spanning over 15years dealing with territorial resilience to flooding . This paper presents a global retrospective view on how research on the concept of resilience began with a primary focus on critical infrastructure resilience networks . These infrastructures are always identified by experts as an aggravating factor leading to territorial systems disruptions . The focus on critical infrastructure resilience networks served as an important first step to improve knowledge on mechanism failures and their impacts on communities . However this first step was insufficient in providing more resilient systems and territories to floods . Today other approaches are useful for implementing strategies of resilience to answer city managers needs such as organizational strategies including participative tools . Long term resilience is addressed within this research for territorial resilience monitoring and planning . This article is primarily based and illustrated on the research projects and scientific advances conducted by the authors .

@highlight This article defends the usefulness of the concept of urban resilience as a risk management tool.
@highlight It presents two approaches to operationalizing the concept of resilience a technical functional approach and an organizational approach.
@highlight The technical functional approach is developed around the issue of critical infrastructures and urban networks.
@highlight The organizational approach is analyzed through indicators of global social urban and technical resilience.
@highlight The originality of the article is that after analyzing these approaches it concludes on the problem of the multitude of methodologies that aim to operationalize resilience including a resilience observatory.
