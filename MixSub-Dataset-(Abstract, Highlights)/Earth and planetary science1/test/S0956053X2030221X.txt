 Acidogenic fermentation of food waste for production of volatile fatty acids contributes to both food waste minimization and resource recovery . To gain knowledge on functional bacterial communities and facilitate continuous production of VFAs this research firstly studied the effects of initial pH values and temperatures on VFAs production distribution and bacterial communities during acidogenic fermentation of food waste . The optimal conditions were determined as pH 7 and 35C corresponding to the highest total VFAs yield of 11.8g COD L with major components of acetic propionic and butyric acid . Bioinformatic analysis showed that the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial classes e.g .

@highlight Food waste acidogenic fermentation for volatile fatty acids production was studied.
