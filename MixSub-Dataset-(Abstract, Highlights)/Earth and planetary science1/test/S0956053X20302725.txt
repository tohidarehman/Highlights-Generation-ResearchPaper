 Knowledge on the material flows of engineered nanomaterials is crucial for assessing their environmental risks . Waste management processes constitute important parts of material flow analyses as they affect large fractions of the ENMs . Accordingly their detailed representation could substantially improve the models . Our goal was to consider the temporal variations of wastewater and solid waste management in the dynamic probabilistic material flow analysis of carbon nanotubes nano Ag TiO

@highlight Waste treatment was refined to model environmental releases of engineered nanomaterials.
@highlight Results provide more accurate estimations of releases of engineered nanomaterials.
@highlight Most environmental releases of nano Ag and nano ZnO enter surface water.
@highlight Soil is the environmental compartment receiving most engineered nanomaterials.
