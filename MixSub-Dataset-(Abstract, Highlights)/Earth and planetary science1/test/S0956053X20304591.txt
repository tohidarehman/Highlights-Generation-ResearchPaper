 This research proposed to investigate a possible destination for the cocoa waste as component in the core layer of Medium Density Particleboards and to evaluate the effect of the waste insertion on the physical mechanical properties of the panel . The core layers of the MDPs were composed by different percentages of cocoa wastes in combination with pine wood . The targeted density of the panels was pre established in 0.7gcm

@highlight Cocoa almond husk waste was destined as alternative to produce MDP panels.
@highlight Extractives and ash may cause a damage in the adhesive particles interaction.
@highlight Decrease in resin to particle ratio may cause damage to the mechanical properties.
@highlight Low percentages of cocoa waste did not hamper the properties of the panels.
@highlight Inclusion up to 21 of cocoa waste meet the standardization for all properties of MDP.
