 Flood waste management is important for reducing the damage and secondary environmental pollution caused by delays in disaster recovery . One key issue related to flood waste management concerns estimating the precise quantity of waste to plan recovery strategies and policies . In this study an advanced flood waste estimation technique was devised using data stratification . In total 90 flood cases in South Korea were sorted by three strata characteristics administrative region urbanization rate and disaster type and coastal accessibility . According to the results such data stratification led to flood waste prediction improvement not only by the single stage stratification but also by successive stratifications . Data stratification was effective both for identifying groups with similar contexts and for eliminating disparities in the dataset that impede accurate waste prediction . Among the stratification sequences tested the order resulted in the most improvement in flood waste prediction was UR AR and DC . This stratification order yielded enhanced waste prediction in 74 cases . Since this study deals with a strategy to resolve gaps in disaster data which is a crucial issue in many countries it is envisaged that this strategy can be transferred to other countries .

@highlight Flood waste data contained case dependent heterogeneity.
@highlight Multiple regression of damage variables was performed for flood waste estimation.
@highlight Data grouping may enhance the accuracy of flood waste estimation.
@highlight Sequential grouping may result in more efficient flood waste prediction.
