 Critical materials are vital to modern technology . Components of modern vehicles can be recycled to recover and reuse the CMs to help ensure a supply of these materials . Electronic components from a 2015 GMC Sierra truck and 2016 Toyota Camry sedan were analyzed for CMs . The components were processed via size reduction aqua regia leaching and dissolution and final solutions were analyzed for metal content . It was found that most electronic components of both vehicles contain CMs . The most concentrated CMs in the components were Sn Nb and Tb . Nd and Co were found in several of the magnetic components . CM economic value was found to be low compared to the overall value of the components and the CM content would not allow for a viable pathway for recycling . Remanufacturing of components may be a more economic option of reuse in the future .

@highlight 31 electronic components of 2 modern vehicles were analyzed for critical materials.
@highlight 12 elements were found in higher content than previously reported up to 1000 times.
@highlight Economic value of critical materials mainly came from precious and magnet metals.
@highlight Critical material recycling economics remains cost prohibitive.
