 Brazilian municipalities face several difficulties while carrying out the municipal selective waste collection at the same time waste pickers organizations need to overcome many challenges to compete in the waste management market . In order to reach the requirements of the Brazilian National Solid Waste Policy it is necessary to know which factors interfere in the performance of MSWC programs and WPOs to understand the relationships between these factors . The objective of this paper was to evaluate the sustainability of MSWC programs and WPOs in the State of Esprito Santo Brazil and propose a new methodological strategy . For data collection questionnaires were given to municipal civil workers from 24 municipalities and managers of 23 WPOs to calculate sustainability indicators and their correlations . Means and frequencies were calculated to analyze indicators in relation to sustainability peer to peer correlation analyses were performed to the construct graphs that obtained correlation coefficients which were applied to study the normality distribution . For each indicator we provided necessary investments to practical solutions . As a result a methodological proposal was presented to improve their actions which was hierarchized by degrees of temporal urgency for their implementation . The design of the actions has great potential to improve and develop sustainability practices in WPOs and MSWC programs . Due to the low quality of primary data collected we recommend the creation of the data control systems to continuously monitor .
