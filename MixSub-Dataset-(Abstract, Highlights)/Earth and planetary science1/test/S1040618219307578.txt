 The horticultural societies of the central zone of Chile in the first millennium AD and the first half of the second have been the subject of archaeological study for many years and their cultural contexts have been described extensively . Their material culture lifeways and settlement patterns present significant differences between the Bato and Llolleo groups in the Early Ceramic period and between these and the Aconcagua groups of the Late Intermediate period . Increasing complexity social differentiation and changes in polity structure have been proposed but robust data are still missing for many of these interpretations . The object of this work was to contribute to the identification of inter and intra group social differences in mobility sex and age patterns and maize consumption based on stable isotope analysis of human bones and a sub sample of teeth . Analysis of the C N and O stable isotopes in collagen and bioapatite extracted from the samples showed differences between the three groups studied in spatial mobility patterns and consumption of C

@highlight Isotope results from Central Chile show differences in mobility patterns between Bato Llolleo and Aconcagua groups.
@highlight People during the Late Intermediate Period show differences according to sex and age.
@highlight Maize intake increases notoriously during the Late Intermediate Period.
