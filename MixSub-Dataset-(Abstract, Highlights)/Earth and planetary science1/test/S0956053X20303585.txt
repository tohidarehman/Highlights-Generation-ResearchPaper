 Dry anaerobic digestion has advantages over wet AD in treating high solid organic wastes like livestock and food wastes but an elevated total solids content would affect the AD performances . In this study methane production of digesters co digesting pig manure and food waste at different TS contents R

@highlight A superimposed model was developed to simulate two peak methane production curves.
@highlight Methanogenic pathway shifted to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in dry AD.
@highlight Acetoclastic methanogenesis overwhelmingly dominated in wet AD.
@highlight High TS content at 20 decreased the specific methane yield.
