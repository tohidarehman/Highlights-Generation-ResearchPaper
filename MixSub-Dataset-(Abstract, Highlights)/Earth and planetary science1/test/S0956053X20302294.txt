 Carbon based bimetallic electrocatalysts were obtained by catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics with Fe Ni based catalysts and were used as efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalysts in this study . The prepared iron nickel alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in oxidized carbon nanotubes are solid products with a unique structure . Moreover the chemical composition and structural features of FeNi OCNTs were determined . The iron nickel alloy nanoparticles were wrapped in carbon layers and the carbon nanotubes had an outer diameter of 2050nm and micron scale lengths . FeNi OCNT with a Fe Ni ratio of 1 2 exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance as an ORR catalyst with a positive onset potential of 1.01V and a half wave potential of 0.87V which were comparable to those of a commercial 20 Pt C catalyst . Furthermore FeNi OCNT12 exhibited promising longterm stability and higher tolerance to methanol than the commercial 20 Pt C catalyst in an alkaline medium . These properties were attributable to the protective OCNT coating of the iron nickel alloy nanoparticles .
