 To study the effects of different ash organics and C H O ratios on bio fuel characteristics and energy efficiency four kinds of sludge with different properties were used for microwave pyrolysis . Moreover the microwave pyrolysis reaction mechanisms of different sludge were also explored . The results showed that high ash sludge could accelerate the frequency of polar molecule rotation in the microwave field due to the presence of oxides with dielectric properties in ash thereby achieving faster heating rates and higher temperatures . However compared with high organic sludge high ash sludge exhibited lower bio gas yield and higher bio char yield . As the H C ratio increased from 0.127 to 0.148 the bio gas yield increased from 15.41 to 40.01 and the content of H

@highlight High ash sludge achieved a faster pyrolysis heating rate and higher temperature.
@highlight High organic sludge generated bio gas with a higher yield and a higher LHV.
@highlight Increases in H C ratios enhanced the H
@highlight and aliphatic contents of bio fuels.
@highlight Decreases in O C ratios resulted in higher CO and oxygenated compound contents.
@highlight A mixture of high ash and high organic sludge can improve pyrolysis efficiency.
