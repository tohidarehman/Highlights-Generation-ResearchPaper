 Landfill simulation experiments were run at lab scale to compare the effects of intermittent and continuous aeration on the evolution of leachate composition and biogas production . The experiments were carried out using six reactors two of them under continuous aeration two under intermitted aeration and two anaerobic as a control . Different aeration regimes produced different effects on reactors . As expected carbon discharge via biogas was higher in reactors under continuous aeration than under intermittent aeration . The evolution of leachate quality was affected by the aeration regimes however at test end very similar concentration were ascertained for relevant leachate parameters in all aerated reactors .
