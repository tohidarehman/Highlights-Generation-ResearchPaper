 Thermal hygienization of waste animal by products before anaerobic digestion is imposed by EU regulations in order to minimize its sanitary risk during digestate land application . This process is energy and time consuming . The present paper deals with the hygienization of ABP using pulsed electric field in a continuous system .

@highlight Hygienization of animal by products prior to biogas production is mandatory in EU.
@highlight Pulsed electric field PEF is proposed as an alternative hygienization technology.
@highlight and
@highlight reduction kinetics by continuous PEF process are studied.
@highlight Synergistic effect of PEF and ohmic heating can reduce 5 log10 of
@highlight PEF treatment with ohmic heating at 25kVcm
@highlight is the most efficient.
