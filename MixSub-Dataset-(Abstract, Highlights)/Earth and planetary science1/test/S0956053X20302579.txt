 Black soldier fly larvae treatment is an emerging technology for the conversion of biowaste into potentially more sustainable and marketable high value products according to circular economy principles . Unknown or variable performance for different biowastes is currently one challenge that prohibits the global technology up scaling . This study describes simulated midgut digestion for black soldier fly larvae to estimate biowaste conversion performance . Before simulation the unknown biowaste residence time in the three midgut regions was determined on three diets varying in protein and non fiber carbohydrate content . For the static

@highlight Digestion products can indicate biowaste treatment performance.
@highlight digestions can be a screening tool for treatment design.
@highlight First study to determine BSFL diet intake and midgut region residence times.
@highlight Biowaste protein and carbohydrates influence midgut residence time.
