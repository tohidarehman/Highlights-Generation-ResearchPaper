 We analyze waste generation differences across Spanish regions by studying the evolution of two complementary indicators municipal solid waste per unit of GDP as well as in per capita terms . To that end we apply the recent statistic developed by Phillips and Sul which allows us to test for the null hypothesis of convergence . In the present case this hypothesis is equivalent to admitting that the waste generation follows a similar path across the Spanish regions . Our results lead us to reject this hypothesis which implies that Spanish regional waste generation is quite heterogenous and exhibits several patterns of behavior . We observe that the northern regions exhibit the lowest waste ratios while the insular and Mediterranean coast regions have the highest waste generation . This different behavior is also explained by some socioeconomic factors . Per capita income environmental spending and education level are helpful in this regard . The population dispersion and the number of years that a region has been governed by a left wing party are also associated with lower levels of waste generation . Finally we can also observe that the regions with the highest levels of waste generation are greatly dependent on the tourism industry . Then strategies targeting the transit towards a more sustainable economy in Spain should take into account this fact . In particular the adoption of methods for the reduction of the waste levels generated by tourism activities in these areas can be very useful .

@highlight Spanish waste generation has reduced since the end of the last century.
@highlight Spanish regional waste generation does not show a common pattern of behavior.
@highlight Madrid and the northern regions have the lowest rate of waste generation.
@highlight The regions that greatly depend on tourism show the highest values.
