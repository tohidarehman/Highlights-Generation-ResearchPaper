 Biodiesel was prepared at laboratory scale via transesterification reaction from waste cooking oil using Sr Ti mixed metal oxide as a heterogeneous base catalyst . The solid base catalyst was synthesized by polymer precursor method . The most efficient active phase of catalyst was explored by varying the Sr Ti atomic ratio in mixed metals oxides . The synthesized catalyst underwent for TGA Powder XRD SEM EDX FT IR XPS and BET surface area analysis to assess its physicochemical characteristics . Additionally basicity which has been observed as the most process governing factor was also evaluated through Hammett indicator benzoic acid titration method . The Sr Ti mixed metals oxide with 4 1 was observed with highest catalytic activity for methanolysis reaction . Its potency was facilitated by fairly acquired BET surface area 43.6m
