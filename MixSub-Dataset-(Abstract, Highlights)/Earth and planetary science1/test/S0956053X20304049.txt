 Safe disposal of the sludge generated from sewage treatment plant is a major challenge worldwide . Hydrothermal carbonization is considered a potential pretreatment alternative for sewage sludge to facilitate the improved resource recovery . In the present study the mixed centrifuged sewage sludge was subjected to the HTC pretreatment to determine characteristics of the solid hydrochar and liquid fraction with a purpose of energy recovery and extraction of value added compounds respectively . HTC was performed in a high pressure batch reactor at 200C temperature for 18h duration . The HC produced after HTC resembled with the low quality peat coal whereas the LF contained value added chemicals such as humic acid and phosphate phosphorous PO

@highlight HTC pretreatment greatly improved resource recovery from sewage sludge.
@highlight The properties of hydrochar formed after HTC at 200C resembled with peat coal.
@highlight TGA kinetics of hydrochar combustion showed great reduction in activation energy.
@highlight 6070 HA and 80 PO
@highlight  P struvite were recovered from process wastewater.
@highlight The recovered HA showed improvement in seed growth.
