 Municipal solid waste is massively generated all over the world . Its organic fraction which represents a high percentage of MSW mainly contains biodegradable materials namely food waste paper and garden waste . The social cost of OFMSW treatment and or disposal is a serious and widespread problem particularly in highly populated areas . Thus effective and innovative solutions which include the upgrading of OFMSW are being currently sought . In fact the OFMSW abundance availability and average composition suggest its considerable potential within the circular economy desideratum paving the way to valorisation approaches . In this context an OFMSW sugar rich hydrolysate and its validation as a substrate for the production of the polyester poly to date the only bioplastic easily biodegradable in marine environment were successfully obtained in a previous study . Based on those results this work addresses the upscaling of the fermentative production in fed batch mode of P by

@highlight Previously validated OFMSW hydrolysate was used to lab scale P 3HB production.
@highlight The OFMSW hydrolysate is a suitable substrate for use as media in the batch phase.
@highlight Sugar rich plum concentrate promotes the production of P 3HB in fed batch phase.
@highlight Combining both substrates the yield was 0.15g P 3HB per gram of sugar consumed.
@highlight The suggested process can integrate into a circular economy model.
