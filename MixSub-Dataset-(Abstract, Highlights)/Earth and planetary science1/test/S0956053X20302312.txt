 Novel and efficient drying method based on electromagnetic induction plate heating was used to treat sewage sludge . This work focused on the effects of EMI P action on heavy metals in dried SS . Surface functional groups surface chemistry and microstructures of SS treated were investigated and compared to provide insights into the transformation mechanisms of HMs during EMI P drying process . The results show that the EMI P dried SS showed undesirably total concentrations of Cd and Zn and leaching concentrations of HMs exceeded the Chinese ground water standard . Ni Zn and As in the EMI P dried SS still exhibited high mobility the leaching percent of Ni Zn and As can reach up to 28.56 10.36 26.96 26.61 and 30.64 23.14 respectively . Compared with conventional thermal drying the EMI P method can effectively reduce the eco toxicity derived from HMs by 28.06 under 500V condition . The stabilization effect of the EMI P action can be attributed to the following EMI P action promoted the generation of surface complexes with HMs HMs adsorption by silicate minerals was enhanced under high frequency magnetic fields and honeycomb structures of EMI P dried SS with micropores provided abundant active sites to bond with HMs .
