 A process for the valorization of citrus peel waste has been developed aiming to produce succinic acid and a series of added value products through the biorefinery platform . CPW was subject to physicochemical and biological treatment to isolate essential oils and pectin as extractable products pretreating the material for subsequent production of succinic acid that enabled application of remaining biorefinery residues as fertilizer substitute . Cellulose hemicellulose and lignin contents of CPW accounted for 22.45 8.05 and 0.66 respectively while acid hydrolysis reduced hemicellulose by 3.42 in BR . Moreover essential oils extracted from CPW included 17 compounds among which D limonene reached 96.7 . The hydrolyzate generated was fermented for succinic acid production using

@highlight A biorefinery process isolated essential oils 0.43 and pectin 30.53 from CPW.
@highlight D limonene comprised 97 of essential oils composition among 17 compounds detected.
@highlight Combined use of CSL and vitamins in CPW hydrolyzates enhanced succinate production.
@highlight Fed batch fermentation improved succinate production from CPW hydrolyzates by 27 
@highlight Biorefinery residues were used as fertilizer imposing stress on plant growth.
