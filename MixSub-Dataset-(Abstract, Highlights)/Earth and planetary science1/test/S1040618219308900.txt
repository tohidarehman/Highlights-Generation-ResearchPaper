 Study of clay mineral is one of effective methods for reconstruction of the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment . Here we represent clay mineral records from an upper MiocenePliocene red clay succession in the central Chinese Loess Plateau . On the basis of the existing age model we employ X ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy to carry out clay mineral analyses the results indicated that illite was the dominant clay mineral and the contents of smectite chlorite and kaolinite were minor . From the analysis of contents of clay minerals illite crystallinity illite 5 10 smectite ratio magnetic susceptibility summer monsoon intensity and deep sea

@highlight Clay minerals of Chaona red clay belong to detrital origin.
@highlight The paleoclimate evolution recorded by clay minerals between 7.5 and 2.6Ma experienced cool and dry cool warm oscillations and warm and humid three intervals.
@highlight The regional tectonic activity and global cooling have affected East Asia Monsoon which was characterized by the different temperature and precipitation in the central CLP.
