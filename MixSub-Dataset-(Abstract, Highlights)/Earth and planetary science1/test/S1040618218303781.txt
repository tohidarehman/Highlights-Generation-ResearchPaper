 Samples from 12 drillhole cores from the Urals Emba region to the north east of the Caspian Sea were analysed for pollen and spores . The records reveal vegetation and climate changes for the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene within the time interval from ca . 3.6 to ca . 1.65Ma . According to the results of the pollen analysis at the beginning of the Akchagylian stage there was a cooling and change in structure of the dendroflora and steppe dominated landscapes were present . At the end of the early Akchagylian and continuing into the middle Akchagylian a maximum variety of pollen from tree species occurred . The presence of mesophilic and thermophilic elements signifies a moderately warm and humid climate occurred at around 3.2Ma probably related to the Mid Pliocene Warm Period . A second major cooling occurred at around 2.5Ma coinciding with the onset of northern hemisphere glaciations . During this time coniferous forests dominated by
