 Recycling of spent lithium ion batteries has drawn considerable attention in recent years as an economic solution to the resource shortage . Selective ammonia leaching is recognized as an economical and environment friendly method yet it is difficult to separate and reuse the valuable metals from the leachate . In this study we proposed an NH
