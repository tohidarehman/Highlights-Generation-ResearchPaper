 Waste mobile phones contain significant amounts of valuable metals and non metallic materials . Consequently the extraction of valuable materials from discarded phones which is a more cost effective method compared with primary mining is an essential step for maximizing the recovery of secondary resources and minimizing e waste pollution . We designed a green and efficient path for recovering valuable metals from waste mobile phones and explored its technical feasibility from both environmental and economic perspectives through life cycle assessment and revenue expenditure model .

@highlight An efficient hydrometallurgical process for recovering valuable metals was designed.
@highlight Technical feasibility from both environmental and economic perspectives was explored.
@highlight Local life cycle inventory relating to hydrometallurgical process was established.
