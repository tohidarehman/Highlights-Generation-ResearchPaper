 Over the last two decades Barcelona has implemented a far reaching reform of the citys solid waste collection . In 2000 the city was divided in four zones with four separate solid waste collection contracts being awarded to private firms with none being allowed to obtain more than two zones a rule that was revised in 2009 to just one contract per firm . This division of the market via exclusive territories sought to enhance competition in the expectation of the convergence of relative costs efficiency and service quality throughout the city . This study analyzes and evaluates the creation of lots as a tool of competition with monthly observations of costs and outputs between 2015 and 2019 . Main findings are that firms producing in larger zones report higher costs that increased competition was not sufficient to lead to converging costs and that none of the firms operate under increasing returns to scale . Based on our results we recommend creating an additional zone . We further suggest that if a public firm managed one of the zones the regulator would obtain more reliable information on the service costs and technical characteristics thus increasing her capabilities as supervisor of the private firms delivering the service in other zones .

@highlight Barcelona has been undergoing a continuous reform of waste collection service.
@highlight The division of the city in service delivery areas promotes competition.
@highlight Scale economies allow proposing an additional area to enhance competition.
@highlight Re municipalization of one area would improve the regulatory capacity of the city.
