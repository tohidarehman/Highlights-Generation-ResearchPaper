 Pneumatic separation was used to separate the valuable current collectors and harmful separators in spent lithium ion batteries to avoid the plastic pollution caused by the separators in this study . Theoretical calculations for suspension velocities of the current collectors and separators indicate that they could be separated under special conditions . Furthermore a special Z shaped pneumatic separator was used to separate the current collectors and separators for the first time . Experiments for manually cut samples indicate that the efficiency of pneumatic separation is approximately 100 with the sizes and airflow velocities in the range of 34cm and 6.967.8m s respectively . Furthermore industrial experiments of pneumatic separation indicate that the recoveries of the current collectors and separators are approximately 99.23 and 98.64 respectively . Computer simulations of the separation process indicate that the turbulence and the changes in high speed zones in the pneumatic separator benefit the separation of current collectors and separators . In conclusion pneumatic separation is a promising technology to separate crushed current collectors and separators .
