 LED lamps have already conquered the market of general lighting . This new product will generate a substantial flow of e waste requiring studies for the correct management especially concerning recycling alternatives . This study proposes a material characterization of all the tubular and bulb LED lamp components . After manual disassembling polymers were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and the metals by X ray fluorescence and acid leaching followed by ICP OES analysis .

@highlight Novel assessment of the materials distribution within tubular and bulb LED lamps 
@highlight Gold silver and others exceed the natural ore concentrations. Found presence of lead 
@highlight LEDs are the most valuable LED lamp component and gold the most valuable material 
@highlight Most of the gallium content is in the printed circuit boards not in the LEDs 
@highlight Need of new recycling alternatives and eco design to segregate the components
