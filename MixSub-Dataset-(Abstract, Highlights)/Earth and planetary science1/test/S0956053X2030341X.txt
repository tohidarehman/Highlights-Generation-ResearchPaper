 This paper contributes to the knowledge on waste biomass conversion processes occurring in the presence of hot compressed water . The experimental procedure detailed herein assesses different process schemes based on the low temperature reaction known as hydrothermal carbonization . The performances of two lab scale reactor configurations with and without a downstream flash expansion step were evaluated and compared . Each setup was tested with six different types of waste biomass . Fir beech and olive prunings are representative of lignocellulosic raw materials while potato pea and carrot are representative of non lignocellulosic wastes from processing in the local agro food industry . The batch reactions were carried out for up to 120min . The hydrochars were characterized by elemental composition humidity heating value and mass and energy yields . The extent of difference between the results obtained for the two procedures varied significantly with the material treated . At a residence time of 30min the solid yields increased due to expansion ranging from 10 to 36 for lignocellulosic material and 50 to 220 for agro food industry scraps . The downstream flash expansion step causes an increase of the solid yields especially for hydrochars from lignocellulosic materials leading to higher energy recovered compared to the configuration without expansion . Lignocellulosic and agro food wastes behaved dissimilarly likely because of different hydrothermal reaction pathways . The additional expansion step can considerably increase the efficiency of energy recovery in full scale plants the extent of which depends on the biomass waste substrate used .
