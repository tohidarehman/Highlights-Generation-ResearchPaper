 In this work the hydrothermal coupling pyrolysis method was used to treat municipal solid waste incineration fly ash and municipal sewage sludge . The regulation of migration mechanism of heavy metals which included Cr Ni Cu Zn Cd and Pb were investigated including the conditional effects of hydrothermal pretreatment the pyrolysis temperature the pyrolysis time and the heating rate on the HM distribution . The results indicated that HTT as a pretreatment method achieved the redistribution and preliminary immobilization of the HMs decreasing the potential environmental risk level . After HTP the HMs were more immobilized and this effect was enhanced when the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 300 to 800C . However Zn Cd and Pb evaporated under high temperature . Leaching experiments revealed that all the HMs in the pyro char from pyrolysis at 800C were below the standard . The influences of the HR and pyrolysis time on the HM immobilization were slight under a higher temperature . After HTP the HM environmental risk decreased to a low level . The physicochemical characteristics of the pyro char demonstrated that carbon trapping and chemical sedimentation played leading roles in the middle temperature range while mineral matrix encapsulation might have been dominant under high temperature .

@highlight Heavy metals were redistributed and mainly accumulated in hydro residue.
@highlight Different HM migration behaviors were observed during hydro residue pyrolysis.
@highlight The leaching content and environmental risk of HMs were significantly reduced.
@highlight The immobilization of HMs was the result of physical and chemical action.
