 China produced a large amount of construction and demolition waste owing to the rapid development of construction industry . Although a set of policies and regulations are being drafted in China for promoting C D waste recycling execution of these policies in practice seems to be far from effective . Currently approximately 75 of Chinese cities are still surrounded by large volumes of C D waste . Therefore identification of challenges in the development of C D waste management specially recycling is essential . This paper employs site visits to 10 recycling plants in 10 Chinese cities and interviews with 25 industry practitioners for examining the challenges . Eight challenges are identified unstable source of C D waste for recycling absence of subsidies for recycling activities and high cost for land use insufficient attention paid to design for waste minimisation absence of regulations on on site sorting unregulated landfill activities a lack of coordination among different government administration departments a lack of accurate estimation of waste quantity and distribution and a lack of an effective waste tracing system . Recommendations to address these challenges are presented . The results of this study are expected to aid policy makers in formulation of proper C D waste management in China and provide a useful reference for researchers who are interested in C D waste recycling industry .
