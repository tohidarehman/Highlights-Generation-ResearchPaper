 The preparation of lightweight aggregate by high temperature sintering is a promising method for recycling solid waste safely especially for solidifying heavy metals effectively . The main aim of this research was to systematically evaluate the effects of the flux components on LWA including Na

@highlight The influence of flux components on the physical properties of LWA is fully analyzed.
@highlight Beneficial to the composition regulation of LWA for recycling solid waste.
@highlight The mechanism of flux components on solidification of Cr was revealed.
@highlight The valence state of Cr in LWA with different Fe content was tested by XPS.
