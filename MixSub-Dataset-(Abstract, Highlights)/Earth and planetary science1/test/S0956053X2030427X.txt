 Municipal solid waste is an environmental threat worldwide however the organic fraction of municipal solid waste has a great potential for the generation of fuels and high value products . In the current study OF MSW was utilized for the production of ethanol hydrogen as well as 2 3 butanediol an octane booster by using

@highlight Ethanol pretreatment improved enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation for OF MSW.
@highlight The pretreatment agents i.e. ethanol and acetic acid were produced from OF MSW.
@highlight The maximum glucose yield of 498.5g kg OF MSW was obtained.
@highlight From each kg of OF MSW biofuels equivalent to 257.4mL gasoline was produced.
@highlight Biodegradable PHAs yield was 40g kg OF MSW.
