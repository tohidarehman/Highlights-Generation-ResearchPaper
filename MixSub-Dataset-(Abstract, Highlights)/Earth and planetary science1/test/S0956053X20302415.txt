 A shift is underway in China from perceiving municipal solid waste as a strictly environmental concern to identifying MSW as a resource . China exhibits a growing focus on using MSW in the energy sector while putting more emphasis on waste sorting and recycling in general and sorting food waste in particular . Timely planning of MSW treatment capacity requires reliable forecasts of future MSW quantities and their characteristics . This article uses econometric analysis to perform regional specific projections for collected MSW . Four scenarios are presented three of which include sorting of food waste from the mixed MSW stream and or capping mixed MSW generation . In the different scenarios aggregated on a national level mixed MSW ranges from 159 million metric tons to 340 MMT and sorted food waste from MSW from zero to 109 MMT in 2050 . Conclusions show that sorting of food waste will create stable levels of mixed MSW in many provinces and that there is a risk of overinvestments in MSW incineration capacity in most provinces .

@highlight A forecast of mixed municipal solid waste MSW and sorted food waste to 2050.
@highlight The article combines econometrics and policy scenarios in MSW projections.
@highlight Results show mixed MSW from 159 to 340 million metric tons MMT in China by 2050.
@highlight Sorted food waste in China is expected up to 74 MMT by 2030 and 109 MMT by 2050.
@highlight The analysis suggests near term MSW incineration over capacity in several provinces.
