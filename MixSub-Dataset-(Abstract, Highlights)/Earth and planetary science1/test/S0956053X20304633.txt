 Relieving from ammonia inhibition and enhancing the utilization of thermodynamically unfavorable propionate are crucial for methane harvest in the high solid anaerobic digestion of ammonia rich swine manure . In this study the potential of dosing zero valent iron for enhancing the methanogenesis to resist total ammonia over 5.0g NL

@highlight ZVI induced 22 CH
@highlight production enhancement and 51 digestion time saving in HSAD.
@highlight Full utilization of propionate in FAN inhibited HSAD was realized by ZVI addition.
@highlight enriched by ZVI were crucial to degrade propionate.
@highlight FAN further decreased
@highlight and then more ZVI was needed to relieve FAN inhibition.
@highlight could produce CH
@highlight in aceticlastic pathway even at FAN about 1.0g L.
