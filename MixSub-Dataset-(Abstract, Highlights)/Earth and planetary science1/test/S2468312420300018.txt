 Central Asia is characterized by a continental climate and a pronounced inter annual variability of precipitation and discharge . In the past hydro climatological droughts led to serious water shortages resulting in crop shortfalls significant economic loss and inter state political tensions . Robust forecasts of anomalous climatic and hydrological conditions may reduce regional vulnerability to hydro climatic extremes and thus can serve as a scientific basis for national and trans national water management . Based on a synthesis of international literature and on our decadal long experience in the region we systematically review the scientific progress in seasonal forecasting and evaluate the potential for a scientifically informed water management . Additionally we discuss to what extent the scientific progress meets the requirements of stakeholders and reveal major obstacles for a sustainable knowledge transfer . Our review shows that exceptionally skillful discharge forecasts for the agricultural relevant vegetation season can be derived by means of statistical models taking remote sensing based estimations of the snow coverage in the Central Asian mountain regions as independent covariates . The consideration of global climate indices in particular El Nio allows to extend the forecast lead times . However decision makers are often not aware of the scientific progress and its implications for improved water management . Despite the continuous international effort with regard to knowledge transfer and capacity development modernization at Central Asian water management institutions is proceeding slowly . A continuous engagement in the field of capacity development and knowledge dissemination at various institutional levels appears necessary in order to stimulate a multi disciplinary network and to support a sustainable regional collaboration in the water sector .

@highlight Central Asia is prone to water shortages during the vegetation period.
@highlight Snow cover observations in spring allow very skillful summer discharge forecasts.
@highlight El Nino influences the winter climate and allows the seasonal forecast of winter precipitation.
@highlight National forecasting services rely on outdated data and forecasting approaches.
@highlight A network connecting forecasting experts and decision makers is highly recommended.
