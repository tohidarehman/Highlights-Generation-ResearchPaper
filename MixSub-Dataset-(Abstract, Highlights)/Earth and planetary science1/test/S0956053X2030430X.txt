 In recent years anaerobic digestion of organic waste is rapidly appearing as a winning waste management strategy by producing energy and anaerobic digestates that can be used as fertilizers in agricultural soils . In this context the management of the OW treatment process to maximize agro system sustainability satisfying the crop nutrient demands represents the main goal . To investigate these traits two protocols to assess the plant availability of digestate nitrogen and phosphorus were evaluated . With this aim the N and P availability was determined on 8 digestates and 2 types of digestate based compost from different OW via sequential chemical extractions . In addition the digestates were tested in soil incubations and in plant pot tests with Italian ryegrass and compared with chemical fertilizer and a non amended control soil . The N extracted from digestates via SCE was related to soil N mineralization and plant N recovery . The C N ratio had negative impact on mineralized N and its recovery in shoots Shoots

@highlight The biogas plant feedstocks impacted digestates quality and nutrients recovery by plants.
@highlight C N ratio increase led to a decrease of nitrogen recovery in plants.
@highlight Labile phosphorous extracted had a positive impact on plants phosphorous recovery.
@highlight First prediction models were done for nutrient recovery prediction.
