 Snow glaciers and permafrost translate fluctuations of atmospheric conditions and highlight current environmental changes . Monitoring of these changes is one of the major objectives of the international climate observation strategy developed by the Global Climate Observing System . Under ongoing climate change the implication of altering meltwater released by snow ice and permafrost will become increasingly relevant for the fragile mountain and lowland environments of Central Asia . These changes will affect the livelihood particularly for mountain communities but also for the highly populated regions downstream . A degrading cryosphere may cause drastic ecological changes and endanger water food and health security leading to pronounced political instabilities and changing socio hydrological interactions . For successful mitigation the adaptation capacity has to be enforced by first creating basic observational datasets on the state and changes of the cryosphere and secondly by providing well calibrated models in connection with climate scenario output . This information is a pre condition to reduce on mid to long term the vulnerability of the local population .

@highlight Cryosphere plays a key role for future water availability in Central Asia.
@highlight Cryosphere monitoring has to be combined with remote sensing and modelling.
@highlight New snow monitoring tools are essential for sound quantification of snow resources.
@highlight Resumed glacier monitoring data improves understanding of the glacier role in runoff.
@highlight Continuous permafrost warming for the past 9 years.
