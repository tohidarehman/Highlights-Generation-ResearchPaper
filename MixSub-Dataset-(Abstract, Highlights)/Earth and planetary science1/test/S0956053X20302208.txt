 Elevated boron concentrations above the regulatory standard were inadvertently discovered in downgradient groundwater monitoring wells at 22 construction and demolition debris landfills in Florida US . This created a unique opportunity to evaluate whether C D debris can be considered a plausible source of boron at unlined landfills . Approximately 1200 historical landfill leachate and groundwater records were surveyed from semi annual and annual monitoring reports covering a 9 year period . Laboratory leaching experiments were conducted on soils from each of these sites to determine if the source could have been boron mobilized from naturally occurring soils . Historical leachate quality data from lined landfills near four of the unlined C D debris landfills were examined to determine if leachate from the unlined landfills could be the boron source . The US Environmental Protection Agency Method 1312 or Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure and the EPA Method 1316 were performed on materials commonly found in C D debris to see if these products have the potential to leach appreciable levels of boron . The results of this work indicate leachate from unlined C D debris landfills as the most plausible source of elevated boron concentrations in downgradient monitoring wells .

@highlight Boron not typically a contaminant of potential concern at C D debris landfills.
@highlight Boron detected at 22 Florida C D debris landfills some above risk based levels.
@highlight Two sources were investigated landfill leachate and site soils.
@highlight Leaching tests performed on 19 materials prevalent in C D debris landfills.
@highlight Results suggest that the source of boron in groundwater is landfill leachate.
