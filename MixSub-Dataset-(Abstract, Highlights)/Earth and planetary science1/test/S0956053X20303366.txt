 Neem leaves possess antimicrobial insecticidal and nitrification inhibitory biochemicals that may influence compost stability . However if neem based compost achieves stability it can prove useful by providing fertilizer cum pesticide properties . Therefore conventional thermogravimetric and spectroscopic analyses FTIR and
