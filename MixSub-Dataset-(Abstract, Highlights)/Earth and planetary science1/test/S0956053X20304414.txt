 The Quebec residual materials management policy implies the banning of organic waste disposal or incineration from 2022 onwards . This policy also applies to domestic ship generated organic waste . However little is known about the current state of ship generated organic waste management in the province of Quebec . This study aims to analyse the current situation and propose sustainable strategies for ship generated organic waste valorisation in Quebec . Using the available data it was attempted to estimate ship generated waste quantities in Quebec after which the current practices of domestic ship generated organic waste management in Quebec and Europe were inventoried along with international waste management practices . Five waste valorisation scenarios were then proposed and compared in terms of advantages and disadvantages required equipment and associated costs and revenues . It involves 1 composting on board of the ship 2 centralised composting 3 composting at the port 4 centralised biomethanation and 5 biomethanation at the port . The current available data on ship generated waste quantities in Quebec did however not allow selecting an optimal scenario . The information provided in this short communication can serve as a valuable basis to guide future research efforts and decision making in this regard . Furthermore the current management of international waste was found to be complex and costly although biomethanation of such waste could offer a suitable and more sustainable solution . Finally it was concluded that a good cooperation between ships and ports is crucial to the implementation of any sustainable waste valorisation strategy .

@highlight The state of ship generated organic waste management in Quebec was inventoried.
@highlight Current available data did not allow total quantification of ship generated waste.
@highlight Five waste valorisation strategies were proposed using biomethanation or composting.
@highlight In depth coordination between ships and ports is crucial to any valorisation strategy.
@highlight Recommendations to guide future research efforts and decision making are provided.
