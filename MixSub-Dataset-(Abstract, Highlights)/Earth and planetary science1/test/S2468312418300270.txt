 Resilience is a topic of extensive academic discourse as its relevance is elevated in response to climate change . There is limited research into the concept of resilience from the perspective of those in fields of practice . To address this gap we conducted fieldwork in four cities to ask for perspectives on what enables cities to cope with water related shocks and stresses . Based on analysis of interview responses and focus group discussions we propose key characteristics of human societal and institutional capacity necessary for urban water resilience . We discuss findings in the context of evidence gathered in the field and prevalent work in current water resilience literature . It is our hope that this work may provide insights into the critically important human dimensions necessary for a shift towards resilience as a prevailing paradigm for urban water management .
