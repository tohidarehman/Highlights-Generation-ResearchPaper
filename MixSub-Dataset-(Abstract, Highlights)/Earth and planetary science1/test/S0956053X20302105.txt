 This study investigates an image recognition system for the identification and classification of waste electrical and electronic equipment from photos . Its main purpose is to facilitate information exchange regarding the waste to be collected from individuals or from waste collection points thereby exploiting the wide acceptance and use of smartphones . To improve waste collection planning individuals would photograph the waste item and upload the image to the waste collection company server where it would be recognized and classified automatically . The proposed system can be operated on a server or through a mobile app . A novel method of classification and identification using neural networks is proposed for image analysis a deep learning convolutional neural network was applied to classify the type of e waste and a faster region based convolutional neural network was used to detect the category and size of the waste equipment in the images . The recognition and classification accuracy of the selected e waste categories ranged from 90 to 97 . After the size and category of the waste is automatically recognized and classified from the uploaded images e waste collection companies can prepare a collection plan by assigning a sufficient number of vehicles and payload capacity for a specific e waste project .
