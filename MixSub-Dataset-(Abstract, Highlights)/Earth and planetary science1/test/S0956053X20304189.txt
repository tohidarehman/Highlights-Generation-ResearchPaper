 Investigations of stabilized solidified sediment by simulated field construction processes are fundamental to evaluating the potential reuse as fill materials . A series of tests were conducted on the samples prepared from S S sediment grains which was obtained by crushing the cement treated sediment . By sampling the SG with different field curing durations and measuring them by unconfined compressive strength tests the effect of t1 on the UCS was investigated . By continually curing the samples prepared from the SG with 28 field curing days in laboratory for an additional 7 28 35 and 70days and subjecting them to UCS and tank leaching tests with different ambient pH values the effect of t2 and ambient pH was evaluated . Increasing t1 and t2 was found to significantly influence the strength of SG which highlights the importance of an appropriate curing period . The releases of the metals in the SG exhibited a strongly pH dependence but less correlation with t2 . Neutral conditions offered the best immobilization capacity for Cu As Cr Ni and Zn exhibited the lowest release at pH 10 the release of Pb decreased moderately with increasing pH . The S S sediment complied with the acceptance criteria in terms of metal release and can be regarded as an environmentally friendly fill material . The results highlight the technical feasibility of stabilized sediment recycling in aquatic environment projects .

@highlight Reusing as fill material in an aquatic condition is a practicable management.
@highlight Extra curing after sampling offers marked technical advantages as fill material.
@highlight Leaching of S S sediment has strong pH dependence and slight time dependence.
