 This study proposes a design of a household waste collection system based on a two stage procedure . First the bin location allocation problem is solved by selecting collection sites from a set of potential sites and determining the type and number of bins at each selected collection site . Second bin to bin waste collection routes are obtained for a fleet of homogeneous vehicles that are restricted by either work shift duration or vehicle capacity . Mixed integer linear programming models are proposed for both stages considering the particular characteristics of the problem . The models are applied to a real world instance in the commune of Renca in Santiago Chile . The results of first stage indicate an important preference for small bins since they have a lower unitary cost . Due to the large size of the real instance a Large Neighborhood Search heuristic is used in the second stage to find good feasible vehicle routing solutions in a reasonable period of time . The results for the routing phase suggest a larger number of routes in the morning work shift since these routes have shorter distances . The LNS heuristic presents a satisfactory behavior when compared to the MILP model with small instances . The proposed bin to bin household waste collection vehicle routing presents a more efficient solution than the existing door to door waste collection in the commune of Renca with respect to the total daily traveled distance and the average work shift duration . Finally a sensitivity analysis is presented and discussed for both models .
