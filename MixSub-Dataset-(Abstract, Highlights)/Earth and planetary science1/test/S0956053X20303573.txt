 An environmentally benign leaching process for recovering valuable metals from the cathodes of spent lithium ion batteries was developed . Glucose oxidase produced by

@highlight A biocatalysts based acid leaching process is developed to recover valuable metals.
@highlight Gluconic acid as the leaching agent is produced through glucose oxidation.
@highlight More than 95 of the Co Li Mn and Ni are recovered from spent LIBs.
@highlight The acid production and acid leaching mechanisms has been preliminarily studied.
@highlight Kinetic analysis is performed to better understanding the leaching process.
