 Liberation and reduction of cathode material are the necessary procedures for improving the recycling efficiency of cathode material derived from spent lithium ion batteries . In this research work a pyrolysis technology was utilized to remove the organic binder and enhance liberation of electrode materials . At the same time pyrolysis treatment can facilitate the thermal reduction of Co

@highlight Thermal reduction of transition metal is synchronized with the liberation of electrode materials.
@highlight Organic binder and carbon black play a role of reductant in thermal reduction process.
@highlight Water leaching combined with reductant free acid leaching can be used to recover Li and transition metals.
