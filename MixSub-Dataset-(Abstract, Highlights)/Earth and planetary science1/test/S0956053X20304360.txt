 Hydrothermal treatment for dairy manure into value added hydrochar and bio oil is a potential technology for its resource utilization . During the process of treatment extractant is applied to the separation of hydrochar and bio oil . In this study three polar extractants and two nonpolar extractants were used and the physico chemical properties of hydrochar and the composition of bio oil were investigated . Compared with nonpolar extractants polar extractants could extract the bio oil absorbed on the hydrochar exterior and interior surface resulting in more mass loss of hydrochar and better extraction performance on the production of bio oil . The decrease of H C atomic ratio and the increase of O C atomic ratio indicated the demethanation tendency to occur during the extraction process and enhanced the hydrochar stability . The scanning electron microscope and specific surface area analysis revealed that polar extractant had a more positive effect than nonpolar extractant on the occurrence of disperse spherical microparticles and the augment of hydrochar specific surface area . The bio oil from polar extractant mainly consisted of N containing compounds ketones phenols and acids while the bio oil from nonpolar extractant mainly consisted of esters alkanes and aromatics . These results reveal that the hydrochar extracted by polar solvent exerts a greater potential for the production of carbon based material .

@highlight Effect of five extractants on yield and properties of hydrochar were investigated.
@highlight Polar solvent extracted bio oil absorbed on exterior and interior hydrochar surface.
@highlight Polar extractant caused more mass loss of hydrochar than nonpolar extractant.
@highlight Demethanation tendency during extracting can enhance the hydrochar stability.
@highlight More disperse spherical microparticles were found after polar solvent extracting.
