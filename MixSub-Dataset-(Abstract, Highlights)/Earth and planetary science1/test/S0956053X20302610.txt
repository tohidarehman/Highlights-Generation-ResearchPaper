 Volatile fatty acids are intermediates of anaerobic digestion with high value and wide range of usage . Co digestion of sewage sludge and external organic waste for VFA production can help achieve both resource recovery and ensure sustainable and innovative waste management . In view of this the effect of substrate proportions on VFA production from co digestion of primary sewage sludge and OW is studied . Long term operation in a semi continuous reactor was performed to assess the resilience of such a system and the VFA rich effluent was tested for its ability to be used as carbon source for denitrification . Co digestion was initially carried out in batch reactors with OW proportion of 0 25 50 75 100 in terms of COD and scaled up in a semi continuous reactor operation with 50 OW . In the short term operation in the batch mode acetic acid dominated however increasing OW fraction resulted in increased valeric and caproic acid production . Moreover in the long term semi continuous operation caproic acid dominated accounting for 55 of VFAs . The VFA rich effluent from the semi continuous reactor achieved the highest denitrification rate as a carbon source when compared with acetic acid and methanol . The results demonstrate that co fermentation can increase VFA yield and shift products from acetic acid to caproic acid in long term operation and the VFAs can be used within wastewater treatment plants to close the loop .
