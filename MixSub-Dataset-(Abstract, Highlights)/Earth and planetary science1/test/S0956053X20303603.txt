 Spent liquid crystal displays are a secondary source of precious strategic metals including indium . The present study involved optimizing the solubilization of this strategic element from samples of indium tin oxide glass prepared from LCD screens of computer monitors and laptop screens . The influence of operating conditions on In solubilization as well as optimum conditions for sulfuric acid leaching were defined by a BoxBehnken type experimental design methodology . Optimum operating conditions include a leaching step for 30min at a temperature of 70C in the presence of 0.4N H

@highlight Sulfuric acid leaching of indium from liquid crystal displays was studied.
@highlight A Box Behnken design was used for the optimization of the operating parameters.
@highlight Optimum leaching conditions are 0.4N H
@highlight SO
@highlight  t 0.5h T 70C and 50 w v .
@highlight A quadratic model has been defined to predict the indium solubilization.
@highlight Using the optimum conditions 99.5 of indium was solubilized.
