 In Japan approximately 64 of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash is landfilled . Because landfills in Japan are operated without capping the landfill body is directly exposed to climatic events . Increased frequency of heavy rain is predicted to affect the chemical stabilization of bottom ash landfill as rainwater seeps into and interacts with landfill components . This study examined the effect of normal rainfall and heavy rainfall events on the leaching behavior of ions Cl

@highlight Leachate carbonation appears to be a major factor in lowering pH values.
@highlight Normal rain eluted more TOC and soluble ions from BA than heavy rain.
@highlight Heavy rain intensity did not affect cumulative TOC and soluble ion release.
@highlight Notable correlation exists between rainfall and leachate component concentrations.
