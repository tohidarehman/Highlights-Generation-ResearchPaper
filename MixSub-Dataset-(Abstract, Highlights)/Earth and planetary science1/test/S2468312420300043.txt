 Anthropocentrism poses two major challenges to American stormwater management . First the conviction that runoff is a threat to human health and property promotes the construction of storm sewers to rapidly remove runoff from cities with consequent significant deleterious ecosystem effects . Second the pastoral aesthetic preference prompts the dissatisfaction with low impact development that aims to effectively and sustainably manage stormwater because of its unkempt appearance . The 1987 National Pollution Discharge Elimination System initiated a regulatory framework that not only considered human wellbeing but ecological health thereby instigating a challenge to anthropocentrism . With Phase I and Phase II the NPDES stormwater program explicitly include specific measures to regulate stormwater discharges and promote the implementation and appreciation of LID . The advance of American stormwater regulations therefore manifests the intention to attenuate the anthropocentrism impeding the proliferation of sustainable stormwater management moving the country toward ecocentricism and environmental sustainability .
