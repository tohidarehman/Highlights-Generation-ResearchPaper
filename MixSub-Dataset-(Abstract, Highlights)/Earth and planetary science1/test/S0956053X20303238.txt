 Current studies on the food energy water nexus do not capture effects on human health . This study presents a new methodology for assessing the environmental sustainability in the food energy water health nexus on a life cycle basis . The environmental impacts estimated through life cycle assessment are used to determine a total impact on the nexus by assigning each life cycle impact to one of the four nexus aspects . These are then normalised weighted and aggregated to rank the options for each aspect and determine an overall nexus impact . The outputs of the assessment are visualised in a nexus quadrilateral to enable structured and transparent interpretation of results . The methodology is illustrated by considering resource recovery from household food waste within the context of a circular economy . The impact on the nexus of four treatment options is quantified anaerobic digestion in vessel composting incineration and landfilling . Anaerobic digestion is environmentally the most sustainable option with the lowest overall impact on the nexus . Incineration is the second best option but has a greater impact on the health aspect than landfilling . Landfilling has the greatest influence on the water aspect and the second highest overall impact on the nexus . In vessel composting is the worst option overall despite being favoured over incineration and landfilling in circular economy waste hierarchies . This demonstrates that circular does not necessarily mean environmentally sustainable . The proposed methodology can be used to guide businesses and policy makers in interpreting a wide range of environmental impacts of products technologies and human activities within the food energy water health nexus .
