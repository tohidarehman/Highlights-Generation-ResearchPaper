 The management of food waste has been considered an extremely important issue since the 1990s but finding efficient solutions for small and rural communities is still challenging . Anaerobic digestion may provide interesting opportunities in terms of carbon emissions and economic payback in the long term but the choice of the correct technology and the spatial scale requires attention . The focus of this study is on a small rural municipality which is selected as a case study to assess the environmental and economic sustainability of the application of two options for AD and two spatial scales . Both the AD configurations are examined in terms of biogas exploitation through a combined heat and power generator and in combination with a post composting stage of the digestate . From economic and environmental perspectives the consortium scale application of the conventional wet process is expected to generate greater benefits in the long term as it enables 80 more electric energy production and economic revenues savings and avoids carbon emissions . However before selecting the technology decision makers should consider the public acceptance of local communities as the best technical economical solution may not be the most appropriate to specific communities . The methodology developed in this paper and the discussion of the results will inform decision makers about how to identify the most appropriate alternative for their purposes .

@highlight Exploiting biogas in small communities is economically and technically challenging.
@highlight Evaluating the spatial scale for waste collection and treatment is crucial.
@highlight Food waste anaerobic digestion and post composting were studied at different scales.
@highlight Energy savings and carbon balance were analyzed considering two digestion processes.
@highlight Conventional wet processes are preferable if the input waste flow is 3500t y.
