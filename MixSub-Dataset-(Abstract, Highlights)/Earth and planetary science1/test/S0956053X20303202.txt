 The uncertainty arising from laboratory sampling can compromise the accuracy of analytical results in highly inherent heterogeneous materials such as solid waste . Here we aim at advancing our fundamental understanding on the possibility for relatively unbiased yet affordable and practicable sub sampling benefiting from state of the art equipment theoretical calculations by the theory of sampling and implementation of best sub sampling practices . Solid recovered fuel was selected as a case of a solid waste sample with intermediate heterogeneity and chlorine as an analyte with intermediate variability amongst waste properties . ToS nomographs were constructed for different sample preparation scenarios presenting the trend of uncertainty during sub sampling . Nomographs showed that primary shredding final d

@highlight Cryogenic shredding is a highly recommended sample preparation process.
@highlight Practices that introduce bias during the selected sub sampling plan are negligible.
@highlight The selected sub sampling plan is fit for purpose on solid waste characterization.
@highlight Applicability of ToS formula in waste derived materials needs to re evaluated.
