 Nowadays municipal solid waste has become a vital part of the economy both as an output of human activities and as an input in the economy through material or energy recovery . Education has been shown to be closely related to the amount of MSW generated . The present research uses panel data obtained for 25 world counties for the years 19952016 and the examined variables include MSW Gross Domestic Product and education level . Through econometric methods the present paper accounts for the presence of cross section dependence and uses appropriate panel unit root tests to discover feasible cointegrated relationships . Also it strongly accounts for the interdependence between MSW economic growth and education level . Based on these the validity of the Waste Kuznets Curve hypothesis is redefined . Specifically an inverted U shape relationship is observed both in the static and dynamic analyses for MSW . The calculated turning points although quite high they are in all cases within the sample . In all specifications the sign of education level is negative as expected . Therefore it is shown that education can act as an effective tool to enhance pro environmental behaviour leading in turn to lower MSW arisings .

@highlight The relationship between MSW and education is evaluated through panel data.
@highlight Cross section dependence is noticed in the analysis.
@highlight An inverted U shape relationship is observed accepting the WKC hypothesis.
@highlight In all cases education has a negative sign as expected.
@highlight Education can enhance pro environmental behaviours with lower MSW arisings.
