 Worldwide production of large volumes of dredged materials has become a pressing environmental problem . In Turkey the government has yet to develop management strategies that successfully prevent or minimize dumping into the Marmara Sea . One potential solution is the utilization of the DMs as a source of material for earthworks particularly in sanitary landfills in Istanbul and Kocaeli . The most economically developed cities in Turkey they were evaluated in terms of potential environmental impacts and regulatory compliance . Five ports harbors representing specific portions of the study area and different industrial activities were selected as pilot regions . Physical chemical mineralogical toxicological and leaching potential measurements of DMs dredged from the seabed revealed they qualify as non hazardous waste . Index and engineering tests performed on raw and processed DMs were assessed to determine the geotechnical requirements for soil based materials used in sanitary landfills . The results showed that non hazardous DMs could be utilized as a cover base cap liner and or fill material at various sections within the landfills . This method provides environmental advantages not seen with other management strategies for DMs such as dumping at sea or upland disposal .

@highlight Marine dredged materials of Marmara Sea taken from five pilot areas were analyzed.
@highlight Environmental tests classify the samples of dredged sediments as non hazardous waste.
@highlight Beneficial use of dredged material in landfills were evaluated by geotechnical tests.
@highlight Raw or processed dredged material is applicable as cover barrier or restoration layer.
@highlight Beneficial use is cheaper than terrestrial disposal and ecologically more sustainable than dumping at sea.
