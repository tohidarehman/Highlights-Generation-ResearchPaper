 After the Central Asian republics became independent in 1991 the transformation process challenged water governance arrangements at all levels . Analysis of transboundary water governance has mainly found that cooperation has been prevailing over conflict . Much research is driven by the question how global concepts like IWRM or good water governance are implemented in the context of Central Asia studies reveal how their inherent ideas of participation and transparency clash with local realities . Only few authors have focussed on national water governance . Their studies show how powerful actors either resist reforms or use them to secure or enhance their positions . A genuine focus on region specific forms of water governance as well as on national politics is underrepresented in the literature which is explained with funding policies and the restrictions of the authoritarian political regimes .
