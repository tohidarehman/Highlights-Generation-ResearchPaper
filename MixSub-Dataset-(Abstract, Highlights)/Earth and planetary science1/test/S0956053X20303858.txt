 Due to the growing concerns about the increasing release of consumer products to the environment especially for defective electronic products the management of the closed loop supply chain is emerging . To do this a chain consisting of a manufacturer a retailer and a collector is offered in a manufacturer led Stackelberg game . Due to the presenting of some concepts in the model which are provided by considering two categories of customers for primary and secondary goods it is suitable for electronics supply chains . In order to coordinate between the members of the chain a hierarchical revenue sharing contract is introduced which is suitable for some members of the chain where operate as a holding company . In the following some numerical examples are applied to examine the applicability of the proposed models . The results of the sensitivity analysis on the main parameters of the problem indicate an increase in the profitability of all members in the coordination contract compared to the decentralized mode . Furthermore customer sensitivity to price and quality has also inverse and direct impact to members profitability respectively . Each of the analyzes provides some in depth managerial implications that can be considered for future research . Finally another research result will explain the increase in the amount of return defective goods by the customer in the contract mode .
