 Microplastic pollution is ubiquitous and has emerged as a severe global environmental issue . Recent research on microplastic pollution has mainly focused on aquatic ecosystems while knowledge gaps still exist regarding microplastic in terrestrial environments . In this study we established a new method for characterizing microplastic in complex soil substrate using FTIR spectroscopy . Microplastic was separated by density without removing soil organic matter to protect microplastic from damage . The Wizards feature was adopted to automatic direct and continuous characterize micron size plastic . Furthermore 33 soil samples were taken from Guiyu a notorious e waste dismantling area in Guangdong Province China under different land use . The results showed that microplastic was involved in 30 samples and the abundance of microplastic varied considerably among different soils ranged from 0 to 34 100n kg

@highlight A new method was established to test soil microplastic using FTIR spectroscopy.
@highlight Microplastic abundance among the soils in Guiyu ranged from 0 to 34 100n kg
@highlight 60 kinds of microplastics were detected and 88.61 had a size range 1mm.
@highlight The surface morphology of microplastics showed signs of aging and degradation.
@highlight Soil microplastic contained various levels of heavy metals.
