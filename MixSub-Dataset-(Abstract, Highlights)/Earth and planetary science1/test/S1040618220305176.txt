 Our understanding on glacier climate link in the Himalayan region is constrained due to lack of long term observational and high resolution proxy records . Hostile weather conditions and difficult approaches to access glaciers due to rough terrains largely limit observational studies on glaciers in the Himalaya . Sub alpine trees and shrubs close to glaciers growth of which is very sensitive to fluctuations in temperature provide precise continuous record on climate and glacier behaviour to supplement the observational records back to several centuries . To unfold the Gangotri glacier dynamics in the past we developed tree ring chronologies and studied the colonization pattern of the trees in the region . Tree ring chronologies of Himalayan birch and Himalayan pine developed from their respective upper tree line ecotone in the Gangotri glacier forefields showed impact of temperature on the growth variations . A comparison of Himalayan pine chronology with temperature proxies revealed regional and hemispheric scale temperature signal . Using tree ring chronologies we show expansion of the Gangotri glacier during cool phases that are also in agreement with the glacier fluctuation records from Central Asia and Southern Tibet . Moreover using tree colonization pattern in the glacier forefields we established for the first time that the Gangotri glacier terminus receded 1.853km since the late 16th century major part of which receded since 1935 C.E . The glacier retreat associated with the onset of 20th century warming got accelerated since 1957 C.E . . In view of our findings the Gangotri glacier might further face accelerated recession in the 21st century under the projected warming .

@highlight First precisely estimated Gangotri glacier terminus dynamics in the last 447 years using tree colonization pattern.
@highlight Colonization pattern revealed glacier terminus position 1.853km down from its current July 2017 position in 1571 C.E..
@highlight Glacier terminus retreated 1.79km since 1935 major part of which retreated since 1957 1.567km with 20th century warming.
@highlight Ring width chronology of Himalayan pine is consistent with temperature reconstructions from Asia and Northern Hemisphere.
@highlight Low growth periods in pine chronology reflecting Oct Dec temperature corresponding with Maunder Minimum and Dalton Minimum.
