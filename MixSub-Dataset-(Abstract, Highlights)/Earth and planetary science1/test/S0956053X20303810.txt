 Life Cycle Assessment is a widespread tool used to guide decision makers towards optimal strategic choices for sustainable growth . A key aspect of LCA studies of waste management systems where recycling activities are present is to account for resource recovery and the related substitution effects . Although multiple scientific papers assume a 1 1 substitution ratio between similar materials products this is often incorrect as the actual ratio is likely to vary . The focus of this paper is on the calculation of the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics . A state of the art literature review showed that many different calculation procedures were applied which led to a wide variety of substitutability coefficients . In this perspective the objective of this paper is to provide guidelines on the procedure to be followed to calculate the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics . These guidelines are then applied to two waste management case studies one dealing with bottom ashes from incineration and the other with plastic waste . In total sixteen technical substitutability coefficients are given for ten secondary materials based on state of the art and presented case studies . The paper thus represents a step forward in quantifying the substitutability of secondary materials in waste management LCA studies . The guidelines presented may allow other case studies to enrich the list of coefficients useful for all LCA practitioners in a harmonized way allowing a more correct evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with recycling activities .
