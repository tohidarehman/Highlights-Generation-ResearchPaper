 This paper reports a complete characterisation of poultry litter ash and its potential use as a heavy metal stabiliser . We propose a novel approach in which the ashes deriving from municipal solid waste incineration are combined with poultry litter ash rather than with coal combustion flue gas desulfurisation residues . Heavy metals stabilisation was demonstrated by comparing the elemental concentrations in the leaching solutions of the starting raw and stabilised materials leachable Pb and Zn showed a reduced solubility . The characterisation was conducted by total reflection X ray fluorescence X ray diffraction micro Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X ray spectrometry . The results showed that the poultry litter ash was Ca P K and S rich . It contained amorphous materials 73 and fly ash cyclone 61 and soluble phases as well as resilient crystalline and amorphous phases . After two months the Pb and Zn concentrations in the leachate solutions were below the limit set by the European regulations for waste disposal . We propose a mechanism for the heavy metals stabilisation based on the carbonation process and high amounts of P Ca and reactive amorphous phases . In conclusion it is demonstrated that poultry litter ash can be an effective secondary source of heavy metals allowing their immobilisation through P and Ca based reactive amorphous phases .

@highlight For the first time poultry litter ash are well characterized.
@highlight Poultry litter ash contains large amount of amorphous phase.
@highlight This waste is proposed to be used for heavy metals stabilization.
