 Pottery from Kom W a Neolithic stratified site on the Fayum north shore includes intact vessels as well as sherd fragments with fragmented pottery also found on adjacent deflated surfaces . In part because of this material Kom W was previously interpreted as a village associated with the introduction of domestic plants and animals from southwest Asia . Here pottery recovered from Kom W by Caton Thompson and Gardner during their 1920s excavations is reviewed and compared to pottery from other north shore sites . Vessel size is reconstructed as well as placement of the vessels within Kom W. It is suggested that a number of vessels found at Kom W were used for storage in line with similar evidence from the Fayum north shore and from northeast Africa more generally .

@highlight The volumes of vessels from Kom W are reconstructed and vessels are related to their original find contexts.
@highlight Pottery from Kom W has been subject to different deposition processes dependent upon depth below surface.
@highlight Some of the vessels from Kom W were used for storage which aligns with settlement practices elsewhere in the Fayum and northeast Africa.
