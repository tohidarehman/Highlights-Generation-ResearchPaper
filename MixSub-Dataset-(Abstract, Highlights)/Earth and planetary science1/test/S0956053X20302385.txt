 Bitumen ages in the short and long term due to environmental conditions . As the bitumen ages it loses its original properties and flexibility . Hardened bitumen causes certain distresses in pavement that may endanger traffic safety and reduce travel comfort . Bitumen is one of recoverable material however some techniques may not be ecological due to considerable energy time and cost . On the other hand recovering of aged bitumen might be eco friendlier energy efficient and economic by using bio based waste materials such as waste vegetable cooking oils . In this perspective this paper was established on the idea of sustainable recovery of aged bitumen and WVCO . Base bitumen was aged in case of short term and long term in laboratory condition and modified with WVCO ranging from 2 to 10 by weight of bitumen . To determine the effect of WVCO modification on aged bitumen conventional and rheological test methods were utilized . To find the optimum rate of WVCO for full recovery of aged bitumen an index called Pure Rejuvenation Index was specified and applied for each test results . It can be concluded from PRI analyses that WVCO can be used as rejuvenator to recover aged bitumen and approximately 3 and 6 of WVCO are required for ST and LT aged bitumen cases respectively . However different test methods yield different optimum rates of WVCO for ST and LT aged bitumen . Recovering of WVCO and aged bitumen by using together may provide environmental protection and conservation of resources .

@highlight WVCO can be recovered effectively as a rejuvenator in order to recover the aged bitumen.
@highlight The available rates of WVCO are 3 and 6 for short and long term aging case respectively.
@highlight Test methods take an important role to determine the optimum rate of WVCO.
@highlight PRI is an effective and easy methods to determine the optimum rate of WVCO for modification.
@highlight Recovery of WVCO and aged bitumen provides humanistic ecologic and economic benefits.
