 This study assessed the digester stability and overall methane production of co digestion of sewage sludge and pig manure . Four different ratios of PM were mixed with SS to reach different final concentrations of total solids i.e . 4 6 8 and 10 . Volatile solids reduction rate decreased along with an increase in TS and the maximum cumulative methane yield of 342mL g VS

@highlight Maximum methane yield was found in co digester of TS 6 .
@highlight Excess PM leads to the accumulation of VFAs and ammonia.
@highlight More balanced C N ratio is obtained in the co digestion.
@highlight Methane yield is negatively correlated with F I TAN FAN and VFA TIC.
