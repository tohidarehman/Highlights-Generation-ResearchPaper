 Material efficiency measures such as recycling rates are often used to set circular economy targets to achieve higher resource efficiency and lower environmental impact . The aim of this study was to identify material efficiency indicators suitable to reflect the environmental performance of waste and recycling systems using PET bottle waste management in three European countries with diverse waste management structures and recycling performance levels . Material flow analysis and life cycle assessment were performed to assess the material efficiency and environmental impacts of each system as a basis to analyze the relation between these two dimensions . PET bottle waste generation was 5.4kg person and year in Austria in 2013 6.0kg pa in Germany in 2017 and 6.9kg pa in Serbia in 2015 . Out of this waste flow 41 91 and 11 were directed into PET recyclate in Austria Germany and Serbia respectively . For all systems higher material efficiency translated into lower environmental impact and vice versa . However linear regression analysis between different material efficiency indicators and environmental impacts showed that indicators targeted at actual recycling specifically at closed loop were better suited to reflect environmental performance than input based indicators . Therefore whenever data are available output based quality related indicators should be used to measure the material efficiency of waste and resource systems because they correlate best with the goals of increasing resource efficiency and decreasing environmental impacts .

@highlight Relation between material and environmental dimension of waste systems is analyzed.
@highlight Higher material efficiency generally translates into lower environmental impact.
@highlight Final closed loop recycling rates correlate best with environmental impacts.
@highlight Material efficiency does not reflect toxicity impacts of recycling systems.
