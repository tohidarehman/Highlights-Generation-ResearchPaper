 The purpose of this study is to test alternative additives for trace element supplementation and process stabilization during anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge . Process instabilities due to acidification are a typical problem in waste fermentation . Provision with minerals and TE is crucial for microorganisms in AD to work effectively allowing higher organic loading rates within the digester without risking acid accumulation . In batch fermentation tests different mixture configurations of OFMSW digested sewage sludge and biomass ashes were evaluated . Based on an extensive characterization of the TE contained in wood ashes suitable combinations of digested sewage sludge and OFMSW as a baseline substrate together with ash additives were derived . While high dosages of ash reduced biogas production 1 1 mix of ash and OFMSW facilitated higher CH

@highlight Chemical composition of OFMSW and biomass ashes is presented.
@highlight Biomass ashes deliver complementary trace elements to OFMSW.
@highlight Biomass ashes show positive effects on AD.
@highlight CO
@highlight precipitation via metal oxides elevates CH
@highlight concentration in biogas to 98 .
