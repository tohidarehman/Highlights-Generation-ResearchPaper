 This paper presents data on the fragments of ancient sedimentary deposits placed around the Piedade and Casa Branca streams important right bank tributaries of the Paraopeba River . From these data it was possible to establish a picture regarding the paleomorphology and paleodrainage of the area . The methodological steps adopted consisted of the definition of sedimentary facies as well as the establishment of their sedimentary provenance and deposition age . Through the facies analyses it was possible to show channel facies associated with debris flows and sieve deposits . In the sedimentary provenance stage spectra of ages congruent with those found in literature for the Moeda and Cau Formations were identified suggesting that the Moeda mountain range is a source area . We also analyzed data on the sediments of the current bed which indicate the same provenance showing that the current courses constitute an embedded analog of the paleochannels . The data herein obtained corroborate the hypothesis that the eastern periphery of the Bonfim Complex was dominated by a system of alluvial fans between 9.51 and 15.51.6 ka before present whose remnants are preserved on the current hilltops and mid slopes of the basement landscape .

@highlight The ancient deposits are fragments of alluvial fans that dominated the region.
@highlight The Moeda and Cau Formations are the main source of your sediments.
@highlight The current fluvial courses constitute an embedded analogue of the paleochannels.
@highlight The fluvial incision in blocks surrounded by faults preserved adjacent deposits.
