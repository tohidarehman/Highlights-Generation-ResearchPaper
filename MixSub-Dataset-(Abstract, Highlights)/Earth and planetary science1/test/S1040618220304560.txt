 Kettle holes are common ice decay features in formerly glacial landscapes like those in Southern Scandinavia and Northern Germany . Here the kettle holes are represented either as dry depressions wetland areas or lakes . However the majority of these features are silted and part of the present farmland . We investigated a small kettle hole at Tyrsted near the township of Tyrsted south of Horsens with the aim to determine the extension and depth of this feature using geophysical methods . A former excavation at Tyrsted carried out from the Horsens Museum in 2017at a neighboring site revealed Late Palaeolithic flint of the Bromme type and worked reindeer antlers . This connection in a Late Glacial horizon is unique not only in a Danish context and it can help to improve and clarify the dating of the Bromme culture . We used ground penetrating radar electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity tomography to estimate the extension of the kettle hole . Shear wave reflection and refraction seismics were able to detect the bottom sediment of the former lake at about 5m depth . Furthermore a seismic event at about 1.30m depth is visible which can be associated to the transition between the Allerd and Younger Dryas sediment making the detection of the Bromme horizon possible . After the non invasive investigation a location for an open excavation has been chosen in a way to groundtruth the geophysical results allowing the direct comparison with the stratigraphy . These results allow the archaeologists to identify key excavation areas focused on the investigation of the Allerd and Younger Dryas layers in a way to improve the dating information about the Bromme horizon collected so far . Furthermore geophysical investigations together with excavations will enable the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research groups to search large scale palaeolandscapes for these very rare but highly important finds .

@highlight SH wave seismics enables exploring the kettle hole down to its full depth.
@highlight The detection of the Bromme horizon is possible with geophysical methods.
@highlight Ground truthing the results with corings allows the reconstruction of the stratigraphy to plan test excavation.
