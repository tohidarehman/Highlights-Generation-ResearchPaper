 Fast pyrolysis offers a promising efficient way for the resourceful disposal of waste tires and heating rate was a key influence factor on products properties . However the heating rates of the widely used experimental apparatus were generally outside the scope of most fast pyrolysis devices . To better guide actual pyrolysis process the present study focused on the effects of high heating rates on products distribution and sulfur transformation during waste tires pyrolysis . And experiments were conducted at temperatures from 425C to 575C by using a self designed photothermal reactor . The results showed that increasing heating rates posed slight effect on the products yields at 425C while obviously decreased char yield by forming more gases at higher temperatures . Moreover high heating rates promoted the fast cracking of tires to form more radical fragments leading to the formation of numerous small molecule H

@highlight High heating rate pyrolysis provides more radical fragments for secondary reactions.
@highlight Intense aromatization among volatiles at high heating rates altered tar properties.
@highlight Increasing heating rate from 60 to 600C min obviously decreased S content in char.
