 In this study we report the high resolution heavy mineral records from a 200.30m long borehole on the northern coast of modern Yellow River delta covering the last 1.90Myr . The results show that the heavy mineral assemblages are dominated by epidote followed by hornblende garnet and hematite limonite . In the Yellow River sediments the content of hornblende is higher than the epidote and the epidote to hornblende ratios are lower than the core YRD 1101 . The E H show two distinct lower values at depositional unit 42 and DU 41 to DU 2 indicating the obvious influence of YR sediments . The heavy mineral composition of DU 5 is distinct from YR sediments and interpreted as the result from heterogeneous provenance of the adjacent ancient rivers while DU 4 to DU 1 resemble the upper middle reaches of the YR sediments . The different sediment types of core YRD 1101 do not contain markedly different transparent heavy mineral assemblages in terms of concentration and mineral ratios . No matter how sedimentary environment changes the ratios of epidote and hornblende show very stable values in DU 41 and DU 3 due to the influence of YR sediments . The transparent heavy minerals such as hornblende epidote and other stable minerals which were relatively stable are controlled primarily by provenance while the sedimentary environment mostly influences the flaky minerals and the authigenic minerals . This study provides evidence regarding the history of the lower reaches of the YR and YRD since the early Pleistocene highlighting river s important role for the evolution of the western coast of the Bohai Sea .

@highlight The core YRD 1101 sediments are mainly derived by the Yellow River.
@highlight Epidote Hornblende E H ratio is relatively stable under hydraulic sorting and can be used as an indicator of the source areas.
@highlight The proportions of transparent heavy minerals of the core YRD 1101 are controlled primarily by provenance.
