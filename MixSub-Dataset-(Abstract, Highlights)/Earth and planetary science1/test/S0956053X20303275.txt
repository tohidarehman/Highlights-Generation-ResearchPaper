 Olive mill solid waste is an abundant agricultural waste without viable solution . The effects of OMSW different pretreatments different additives and utilization of different saccharification enzymes were tested on saccharification process and sugar release and on fermentation inhibitors formation and ethanol production . Microwave treatment with formic acid resulted in highest saccharification rates and fermentation yields although loss of sugars and fermentation inhibitors production was notable . Microwave with water treatment resulted in less saccharification and ethanol . To facilitate economical process and to extract maximum value solid remnants after saccharification were tested as heavy metal sorbent . Microwave with water resulted in the best sorbent followed by microwave with formic acid . Addition of sulfuric acid to either microwave or autoclave resulted in very poor saccharification and absorbance capacity . Therefore combination of ethanol and sorbent production from OMSW are suggested .

@highlight Microwave pretreatment better than conductive heating 
@highlight Acid and enzyme types are important for saccharification yield.
@highlight Microwave treatment with formic acid on OMSW showed highest saccharification rates.
@highlight The best ethanol yield was 9.1g 100g dry OMSW.
@highlight Hydrolysate solid remnants were effective for removal of Cu and Pb from water.
