 We present rapid and efficient identification of ten different types of post consumer plastics obtained from a local recycling unit by deploying a low cost compact CCD spectrometer in laser induced breakdown spectroscopy technique . For this investigation spectral emissions were collected by an Echelle spectrograph equipped with an intensified charge coupled device as well as a non gated Czerny Turner CCD spectrometer . The performance is evaluated by interrogating the samples in a single shot as well as accumulation mode . The results from principal component analysis have shown excellent discrimination . Further the artificial neural network analysis has demonstrated that individual identification accuracies rates up to 99 can be achieved . The data acquired with ES ICCD in the accumulation of ten shots have shown average identification accuracies 97 . Nevertheless similar performance is achieved with the NCT CCD spectrometer even in a single shot acquisition which reduces the overall analysis time by a factor of 15 times compared to the ES ICCD . Furthermore the detector collection system size weight and cost also can be reduced by 10 times by employing a NCT CCD spectrometer . The results have the potential in realizing a compact and low cost LIBS system for the rapid identification of plastics with higher accuracies for the real time application .
