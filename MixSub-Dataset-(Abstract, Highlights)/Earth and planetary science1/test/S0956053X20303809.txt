 Reducing food waste is necessary for achieving healthy diets and sustainable food systems due to its negative impacts on resource conservation food security and environmental social and economic costs . This paper aim is to quantify the amount and types of food that is wasted by the consumers in different restaurant configurations . The second aim is to understand the reasons which lead them to waste food and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the waste . To fulfil the aims a mixed methodology was used including primary data collection in restaurants for the quantification of food waste interviewing consumers and staff along with calculating the environmental impact from the waste using life cycle assessment . The results show that different incentives and levels of interaction in consumers choice of food types exert influence on plate food waste . When incentive and interaction are low the amount of food waste is larger . It is the case of a la carte restaurants . The best performance in the restaurant categories was when both incentive and level of interaction were higher . Buffet where the consumers pay by weight therefore is the configuration that generates less food waste on the consumer s plate . The main wasted products are rice and beans followed by beef and then other carbohydrates . The life cycle assessment indicated a carbon footprint varying from 128 to 324g CO

@highlight Different incentives and levels of autonomy influence consumes food waste.
@highlight When incentive and autonomy are low the amount of food waste is higher.
@highlight The best performance was when incentive and level of interaction were higher.
@highlight The main wasted products are rice and beans followed by beef and carbohydrates.
@highlight Plate waste is not visible to consumers.
