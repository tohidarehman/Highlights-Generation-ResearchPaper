 With the rapid development of renewable energy the impact on environment and resource caused by waste photovoltaic modules has been realized gradually . To solve the problem recycling becomes an effectual way . Therefore the aim of this paper was to assess the economic feasibility of the photovoltaic modules recycling project in China by using cost benefit analysis . It was found that under the estimated treatment quantity will generate in China in 20202034 the recovery cost per kilowatt of photovoltaic modules will be 25.11 USD the unit benefit is 25.68 USD kW and the unit net benefit is 0.57 USD kW . The net present value and benefit cost ratio are 21.14 million USD and 1.023 . The sensitivity analysis indicated that the sale benefits of recycled materials and tax were the most sensitive factors affecting the project s economy . Finally we proposed ways to improve the economy for the government and related enterprises .
