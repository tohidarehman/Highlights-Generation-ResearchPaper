 Recycling automotive waste has increasingly become an alternative solution towards producing sustainable materials given the rising issue of raw material shortages and waste management challenges at global level . The improper end of life vehicle waste management poses detrimental impacts on the environment . This paper proposes a novel method to develop thermal insulation sandwich panels using ELV waste motivated by the critical needs of creating high performance thermal insulation for buildings . Six sandwich panels of different weight and ratio of shredded ELV particles were manufactured . The sandwich panels structure was made of three layers a core and a glass face sheet bonded to each side . The core structure composed of Polycarbonate from headlamp lenses and polyurethane from seat bonded using resin casting approach . Thermal conductivity of the samples was measured using guarded hot plate apparatus . Results corroborated that thermal conductivity of ELV based sandwich panels reduced remarkably compared to panel without ELVs recorded at 15.51 reduction . Composition gives the best thermal performance was made of mixed ELV core materials of ratio 50 PC 50 PU it has a thermal conductivity value of 0.1776W mK . The transparency data were obtained using Haze gard plus haze meter . The best luminous transmittance value was exhibited by P2 67.47 . The best clarity value and haze value were shown by P6 55.13 and 52.6 respectively . ELV waste can be recycled to develop useful sustainable thermal insulation to improve thermal and optical transparency performance of buildings as a substitute for conventional materials which have a relevance for future faade concepts .
