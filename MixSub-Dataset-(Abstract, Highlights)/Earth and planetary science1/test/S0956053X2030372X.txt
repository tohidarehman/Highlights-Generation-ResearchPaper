 Municipal solid waste management is an important but complex logistical problem . The deployment of MSW management systems is hindered by the ever growing generation of waste and the often insufficient infrastructure to manage process and dispose of waste . This paper presents a coordinated framework for complex MSW management systems . The framework accommodates multiple key stakeholders in MSW systems such as suppliers of waste consumers of waste and derived products and providers of transportation and processing services . Here the stakeholders submit bids to a coordinator that solves an optimization problem to determine allocations and clearing prices that maximize the collective profit for all stakeholders and that balance supply and demand for waste and products . Furthermore the clearing process guarantees that the individual profits are non negative . Notably the framework operates as a competitive market that accelerates transactions between stakeholders and that handles complex logistical constraints that would be difficult to handle in peer to peer transactions . The framework also facilitates the integration of policy incentives and the monetization of environmental impacts . In this regard we evaluate a tax applied to open dump disposal . To illustrate the applicability an MSW system in Mexico was analyzed as a case study . Results reveal that taxation can be used to incentivize the provision of services for all stakeholders . Specifically we found that an appropriate tax can completely avoid disposal in open dumps . A tax of 5.1 USD tonne was identified as the minimum penalization that avoids diverting waste to open dumps .

@highlight A coordinated market framework for municipal solid waste management is proposed.
@highlight A taxation scheme that avoids open dumps disposal is presented.
@highlight Suppliers consumers and providers are identified as stakeholders.
@highlight Results show the allocations that maximize the profit for all stakeholders.
@highlight The clearing process balances supply and demand for waste and products.
