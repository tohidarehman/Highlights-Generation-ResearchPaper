 Process instability with consecutive low methane production are common challenges of the anaerobic digestion of municipal wastes . In the present study the co digestion of sewage sludge and municipal biopulp was investigated at batch and continuously fed digesters . At batch tests the highest methane yield for co digestion 46717 mLCH

@highlight Highest CH
@highlight yield was achieved when biopulp shared 80 VS and sludge shared 20 VS.
@highlight Co digestion process sufficiently succeeded in continuous mode.
@highlight IC
@highlight of potassium for co digestion 80 biopulp 20 sludge was 8g L.
@highlight The continuous co digestion process was validated using BioModel accurately.
@highlight Simulations confirmed the strong inhibition of potassium to the co digestion.
