 This research focused on the recovery of valuable materials from ferrous grinding swarf . We received the sample from the automobile industry . The sample has consisted of approximately 20wt moisture and 80wt residue . The chemical composition of the oven dried sample was approximately 87wt iron . In this study aqueous washing process for oil removal from ferrous grinding swarf was investigated with two different commercial reagents Micro 90 and Detergent 8 . Three different amounts of solids were mixed with 20mL of diluted reagents for the aqueous washing . In the Micro 90 solution about 80 of the oil was removed after three washing cycles at a solids content less than 3g 20mL . On the other hand when using Detergent 8 100 oil was removed after three washing cycles at a solids content of less than 3g 20mL . Pulp density was an important factor in determining oil removal efficiency . For the scale up experiment different washing methods such as ultrasonication and overhead stirrer were examined . The preliminary reuse test of the Detergent 8 solution was also conducted for the feasibility of the aqueous washing process .
