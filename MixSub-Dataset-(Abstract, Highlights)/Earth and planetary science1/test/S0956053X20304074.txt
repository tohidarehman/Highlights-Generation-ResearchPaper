 In recent years a growing number of investigations have examined food waste in the food service sector in which the catering of individual events received little attention .

The case study presents findings about the influences of four variables namely event type season event size and menu prices on buffet leftovers . We used a waste tracking system that allowed kitchen staff to quantify buffet leftovers for 4years from the beginning of 2014 until the end of 2017 . Among the studied variables the event size demonstrated the strongest influence on the generation of buffet leftovers in the case study . Buffet leftovers showed a trend of decreasing quantities relative to the number of guests for increasing event sizes . For instance smaller events with less than 100 participants recorded the highest quantities of approximately 280g of buffet leftovers per guest and larger events of more than 500 participants recorded the lowest quantities of approximately 74g per guest . In addition we found that three food product groups
