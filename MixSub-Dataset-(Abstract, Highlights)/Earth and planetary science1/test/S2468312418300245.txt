 Urban systems are embedded within and thereby reliant upon the complex systems of their surrounding watersheds . Building the freshwater resilience of urban systems therefore hinges on building the freshwater resilience of the larger human hydrological systems within which they are nested . This consideration creates a system of feedbacks and tradeoffs which are critical to the resilience of the system as well as complex to manage from both hydrological and institutional perspectives . There are few pragmatic examples within the literature of how to plan for freshwater resilience in urban hydrological systems . This article shows an example of the freshwater resilience planning and investment prioritization process for the water supply of Mexico City and the surrounding supply systems .

@highlight Introduction of approach for freshwater resilience planning under uncertainty.
@highlight Approach is applied to the Greater Metropolitan Supply System of Mexico City GMSS .
@highlight Need to treat urban areas as nested in the broader freshwater systems demonstrated.
