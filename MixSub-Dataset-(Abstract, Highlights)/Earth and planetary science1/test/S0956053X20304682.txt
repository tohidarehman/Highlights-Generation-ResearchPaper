 The present research focused on evaluating the role of waste fishbone hydroxyapatite in stabilizing heavy metals particularly Pb and Zn in incineration fly ash . Bones were collected from various fish species and processed for batch experiments . A commercial apatite product was also obtained for a comparative analysis . The experiments were performed at fishbone fly ash ratios of 0.0 and 1 10 settling times of 6 12 24 and 672h and W S ratios of 1.0 and 1.5mL g. The highest Pb removal efficiency reached 86.39 at 28days settling periods when the FB HAP dose was only 10 at W S 1.5mL g. FB HAP was found noticeably more effective than Apatite II particularly at shorter settling periods . Stabilization of Zn was efficient at longer settling period using FB HAP . The highest stabilization rate of Zn was 62.67 at W S 1.0mL g. The results indicated that settling time and W S ratio were the most important factors to enhance the stabilization of Pb and Zn in IFA . Utilization of waste fishbone is expected to be a low cost and eco friendly technology .

@highlight Waste fishbone hydroxyapatite FB HAP is a potential heavy metals stabilizer.
@highlight FB HAP and Apatite II are investigated for stabilization of Pb in MSWI fly ash.
@highlight Additional hydrous condition is preferred for heavy metal stabilization.
@highlight Longer period of settling time achieved higher Pb and Zn removal efficiency.
@highlight FB HAP was noticeably about 1.52 times more effective than Apatite II.
