 Bread waste represents a significant part of food waste in Sweden . At the same time the return system established between bakeries and retailers enables a flow of bread waste that is not contaminated with other food waste products . This provides an opportunity for alternative valorisation and waste management options in addition to the most common municipal waste treatment namely anaerobic digestion and incineration . An attributional life cycle assessment of the management of 1kg of surplus bread was conducted to assess the relative environmental impacts of alternative and existing waste management options . Eighteen impact categories were assessed using the ReCiPe methodology . The different management options that were investigated for the surplus bread are donation use as animal feed beer production ethanol production anaerobic digestion and incineration . These results are also compared to reducing the production of bread by the amount of surplus bread . The results support a waste hierarchy where reduction at the source has the highest environmental savings followed by use of surplus bread as animal feed donation for beer production and for ethanol production . Anaerobic digestion and incineration offer the lowest environmental savings particularly in a low impact energy system . The results suggests that Sweden can make use of the established return system to implement environmentally preferred options for the management of surplus bread .

@highlight An ALCA assessed seven management alternatives for surplus bread.
@highlight Better environmental results for alternatives that require segregated bread.
@highlight Donation feed beer and ethanol production had the best environmental performance.
@highlight Anaerobic digestion and incineration had the lowest environmental performance.
@highlight The return system for bread can be used to implement better management options.
