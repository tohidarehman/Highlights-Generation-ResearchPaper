 For sustainable growth an economic model must tend toward a circular system especially in the field of waste management . This work focuses on the valorization of spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst from oil refineries which generate 400 000 metric tons of spent catalyst per year worldwide most of which is sent to landfills . A new alternative to landfilling is proposed for this waste based on the combination of acid leaching for the recovery of lanthanum a valuable rare earth and the reuse of the leached solid residue as a cement substitute . A comparative life cycle assessment was made including four environmental impact categories i.e . global warming fossil resource scarcity mineral resource scarcity and water consumption in order to quantify the potential environmental benefits of secondary lanthanum recovery from industrial waste with respect to primary lanthanum extraction from mineral resources . A maximum of 85.6 La recovery was achieved and 15wt of cement can be substituted with leached solid residue without changing the original cement classification . The waste management process presented in this paper promotes the sustainable management of the spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst and contributes to the development of a new resource for a critical material such as lanthanum . The implementation of this novel waste management process could reduce global warming and mineral resource scarcity but would increase fossil resource scarcity and water consumption in comparison with primary La extraction .

@highlight Valuable products can be obtained from spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst.
@highlight More than 85wt of lanthanum recovery can be achieved by acid leaching.
@highlight The leaching solid waste can substitute 15wt of cement in cement pastes.
@highlight Net saving in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional LaCl
@highlight production.
@highlight Aluminium recovery by adding NaOH involves higher impact in other environmental categories.
