 Seismic hazards and risks around an individual fault can be assessed from complementary paleoseismic data . A high resolution sediment core recovered from the Yileimu Lake revealed 11 potential paleoearthquakes around the Fuyun fault in northern Xinjiang . Among them three events recorded by ductile deformation and turbidites or coseismic subsidence were possibly correlated with

@highlight Lake sediments recorded 11 potential paleoearthquakes around the Fuyun fault.
@highlight Intensities and magnitudes for distinct sedimentary events were distinguished.
@highlight Recurrence intervals for earthquakes with different magnitudes were proposed.
