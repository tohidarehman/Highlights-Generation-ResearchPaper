 The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of removal of difficult to biodegrade organic compounds from real stabilized landfill leachate with a membrane process alone and in combination with powdered activated carbon adsorption . For filtration ceramic membranes were used . The characteristics of the raw leachate were 788mg COD L and color of 0.4458cm

@highlight Stabilized landfill leachate was treated by PAC combined with ceramic MF UF fine UF.
@highlight Adsorption was the main process in organics removal regardless of the systems used.
@highlight Particles 100kDa removed most efficiently particles 3kDa least efficiently.
@highlight PAC 3g L 30min MF 0.3MPa most effective in terms of permeate flux.
@highlight COD and color removal efficiencies were 87.8 and 97.2 respectively.
