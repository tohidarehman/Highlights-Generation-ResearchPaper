 The possibility of a pyrolysis process as a mean of recycling the residual plastic rich fraction derived from of a material recovery facility has been evaluated . The unknown product composition of WEEE residue has been supposed through coupled thermal infrared analysis and ultimate analysis and resulted as PP 3wt PBT 3wt PVC 4wt styrene based polymers 50wt thermosetting resins 24wt inorganic fraction 16wt . DSC experiments showed that the overall energy defined as the degradation heat needed in order to completely degrade WEEE residue was about 4 of the exploitable energy of the input material . The effect of temperature and different zeolite catalysts were investigated in particular in terms of yield and quality of the produced oils during the pyrolysis process . Produced oils were potentially exploitable as fuels and almost all catalysts improved their quality . The best performance was reached by NaUSY with the second highest production of light oil and the greatest total monoaromatics yield plus 12wt in comparison to thermal pyrolysis experiments . Furthermore light oil produced by NaUSY has one of the best LHV and no halogenated compounds were detected by GCMS analysis . Char or pyrolytic gas combustion could supply the energy required for the thermal degradation of WEEE Residue .

@highlight Valorization of a WEEE plastic residue that currently dont find a proper recycling route.
@highlight Supposed product composition of WEEE plastic residue by thermal and infrared analysis.
@highlight Effect of different zeolites on pyrolysis of the WEEE plastic residue was investigated.
@highlight The best results in terms of light oil yield and quality are obtained using NaUSY 5.7 .
@highlight Highly contaminated and heterogeneous plastic waste is less susceptible to catalysts activity.
