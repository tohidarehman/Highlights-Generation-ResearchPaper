 This paper presents an inventory of sewage sludge ashes generated in the mono incineration plants for municipal sewage sludge in Poland . This research focused on the detailed study of mass flows chemical composition and phosphorus recovery potential . There are currently 11 sludge mono incineration plants operated with a total capacity of 160 300Mg dry weight of sludge annually . Recently a significant increase in the amount of SSA generated in these plants has been observed reaching 26 756Mg in 2018 . Chemical composition of SSA showed significant amounts of the main nutrients calcium phosphorus magnesium and potassium . Additional main elements were iron silicon and aluminium . The main trace elements in the SSA were zinc and copper . Pollutants according to fertilizer regulations of different countries present in Polish SSA were chromium nickel lead and cadmium . The radionuclides uranium and thorium often present in higher amounts in commercial phosphate rock based fertilizers were only detected in SSA at low levels of 49mg kg and 23mg kg respectively . Theoretical phosphorus recovery potential from the SSA was estimated at 1613.8Mg of which 33.9 is bioavailable . Currently in Poland the recommended approach is the production of fertilizers as a result of the extraction of phosphorus from the SSA with its use in the production of secondary mineral fertilizers . Further research in this area is required considering Polish conditions and legislation .
