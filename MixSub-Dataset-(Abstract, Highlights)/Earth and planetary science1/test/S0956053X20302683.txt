 Typical used disposable nappies usually consist of nonwoven fabrics Super Absorbent Polymer and organic material namely fluffy pulp urine and or excreta . Currently this waste stream is being disposed to landfills causing many environmental issues . An alternative management method could be the valorisation of the biodegradable material through anaerobic digestion and the recycling of plastics and SAP . Pretreatment of nappies is mandatory to separate SAP and plastics from the organic material . The aim of this work was the development of a process to minimize SAPs volume as this component can swell up to 1500 times its own mass by water absorbance thus hindering any further biological process . CaCl

@highlight A pretreatment procedure for used disposable nappies was developed.
@highlight CaCl
@highlight and MgCl
@highlight were tested against their deswelling efficiency on SAP.
@highlight pH and solution volume did not affect SAPs deswelling.
@highlight Mixtures of CaCl
@highlight and MgCl
@highlight could reduce SAPs volume by 93 
@highlight Nappies hydrolysate can be used as substrate in co digestion anaerobic processes.
