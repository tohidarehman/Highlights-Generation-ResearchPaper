 Platinum group metals have gained significant interest due to their unique characteristics which make them the main constituents in advanced applications . In this work we introduce new pH dependent optical mesocaptors for the colorimetric monitoring and separation of Au from E waste leach liquors without a preconcentration process . The mesoporous silica nanospheres are fabricated via simple reproducible and low cost procedures . The optical mesocaptor is designed via indirect immobilization of thiazole yellow G and amacid yellow M chromogenic probes onto mesoporous nanostructured scaffolds . The silanol groups in the mesopores of silica surface robustly anchored dilauryl dimethyl ammonium bromide linker to induce the interactions with the TYG and AYM chelates thereby leading to the fashioning of a stable optical mesocaptors without releasing of the chelates throughout adsorption and sensing assays . The finding provides evidence of the capability of the synthesized decorated new nanostructured sensor shows excellent sensitivity toward Au with a limit of detection as low as 1.16g L

@highlight A hand operating and easy to make synthesis of mesoporous sensors was achieved.
@highlight The synthesized sensors showed evidence of highly sensitive detection of Au III .
@highlight This process shown functionality in terms of selectivity and reversibility.
@highlight Extraction of gold ions from E waste was evident.
