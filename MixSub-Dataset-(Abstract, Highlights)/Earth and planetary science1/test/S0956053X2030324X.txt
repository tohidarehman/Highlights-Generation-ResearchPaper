 Optimization of anaerobic digestion poses many practical constraints . Therefore a new approach was developed by integrating mathematical modeling and desirability analysis to determine optimum amounts of input factors . For this purpose different proportions of co digestion and pretreatments NaOH and H

@highlight Optimization was done by integrating mathematical modeling and desirability analysis.
@highlight Box Cox transformation could determine the best lambda for model transformations.
@highlight Range optimization was more valuable for practical use than point optimization.
@highlight High amounts of H
@highlight and moderate NaOH could improve the anaerobic digestion.
@highlight Amount greater than 25 grapefruit waste in the digestion decreased plant efficiency.
