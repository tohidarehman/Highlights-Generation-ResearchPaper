 This study evaluated the physicochemical and morphological properties of pectin and chitosan particles combined with sugarcane vinasse for soil fertilization applications . Particles were obtained by adding the biopolymeric solutions dropwise into the crosslinking solutions followed by drying . Vinasse enhanced pectin gel stability improving pectin vinasse particle properties . Physicochemical characterization indicated that vinasse nutrients were properly incorporated in both pectin and chitosan matrices . Particles showed spherical shape with an average diameter of 3 and 2mm for the pectin and chitosan particles with vinasse respectively . Chitosan particles compared to pectin showed lower swelling capacity and solubility and higher mechanical resistance indicating a denser and more compact polymer network . Both particles were able to hinder water evaporation rates from sandy soil under water stress conditions . Biobased particles with vinasse added show potential to be applied as soil fertilizer representing an alternative to use and disposal of this expressive wastewater from sugar and alcohol industries .
