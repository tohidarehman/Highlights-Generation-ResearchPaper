 In the current scenario used paper cups are disposed of without any proper treatment thereby damaging the environment . Hence the vermicomposting technique is preferred for managing these wastes . The ability of bacterial strains on cellulase enzyme production at altered pH and temperatures were focused in this study . Among nine bacterial strains

@highlight Paper cup with polyethylene coating remains undegraded in environment.
@highlight Cellulolytic enzyme activity was studied both qualitatively and quantitatively.
@highlight Potential cellulolytic bacteria help in decreasing the duration of degradation.
@highlight Paper cup waste degradation is substantiate by insilco analysis.
