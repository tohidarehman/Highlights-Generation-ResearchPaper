 This research assessed the impact of volatile fatty acids recovery and biomethane potential in an integrated fermentation digestion process with a single stage digestion of primary and rotating belt filtration sludges . Implementing semi continuous fermentation at 1 2 and 4days solids retention time showed a direct impact on the hydrolysis and VFA recovery which increased as SRT increased while also improving the dewaterability by reducing the concentrated sludge volume index of the processed sludge . pH controlled fermentation was effective improving the VFA yields by up to 93 and 72 at pH 9 for RBF and primary sludges respectively although fermentation at pH 6 showed promise for enhancing VFAs while lowering the required chemicals significantly . Although cellulose constituted only 21.0 and 29.5 of the TSS in primary and RBF sludges it contributed 3841 of the methane production for the two sludges respectively . Experimental results of integrated fermentation digestion and single stage digestion processes were incorporated in techno economic analysis . Results confirmed the economic viability of fermentation with payback periods of 2.71.1years and 3.62.7years while also revealed that VFA recovery could save up to 7.22.0 and 7.62.7 of the respective total sludge handling and disposal costs despite an average of 12.7 and 8.4 decrease in biogas production due to VFA extraction in the integrated systems of RBF and primary sludges respectively . Overall the integrated fermentation digestion system economically outperformed the single stage digestion for both sludge types under all studied scenarios .
