 Much attention has been devoted to disposing traditional sized poly waste by pyrolysis for methyl methacrylate . The pyrolysis of micron sized PMMA waste which may be different from that of traditional sized PMMA waste received little concern . The present study investigated the kinetics and volatile products of micron sized PMMA waste pyrolysis in inert atmosphere using thermogravimetry and Fourier transform infrared analysis . A global optimization algorithm namely Shuffled Complex Evolution was employed to simultaneously optimize the kinetic parameters . Results indicated that one shoulder and one peak occurred in the MLR variations with temperature . The values of the MLR at the shoulder and peak the average MLR all increased with the heating rate . The optimized kinetic parameters by SCE can be utilized to well reproduce the experimental thermogravimetric data . The values of activation energy and natural logarithm of pre exponential factor were in the range of 235.95248.61kJ mol and 16.9628.76min
