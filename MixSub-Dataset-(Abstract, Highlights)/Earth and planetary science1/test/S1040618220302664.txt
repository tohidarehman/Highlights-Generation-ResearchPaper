 We present the results of a new dating study carried out at Lunery la Terre des Sablons and Brinay la Noira two key Lower Palaeolithic sites located in deposits associated to the Cher River . These sites preserve abundant Mode 1 and Mode 2 lithic industries and are considered as among the oldest evidence of hominin presence in Western Europe north of the 45N latitude . Following a multi technique approach combining electron spin resonance single grain thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence dating of quartz grains and palaeomagnetism we obtained new chronological constraints for the sedimentary sequence and the associated lithic assemblages at the two sites . The new independent dating results derived from each method are consistent and in overall agreement with existing ESR and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide burial age estimates except for the Lowermost Unit 3at LTS . By integrating all of the previous and new dating results we derive combined age estimates of 772 735 ka and 66529 ka for the fluvial sands at LTS and BN respectively . These two distinct aggradation phases may tentatively be correlated to interglacial glacial transitions associated with Marine Isotope Stage 19 18 for the former and MIS 17 16 for the latter .

@highlight New dating results for the Lower Palaeolithic sites of Lunery la Terre des Sablons LTS and Brinay la Noira BN France.
@highlight A multi technique approach was employed combining multiple centre ESR dating single grain TT OSL dating and palaeomagnetism.
@highlight At BN an age range of 638676 ka may be proposed for the hominin occupation.
@highlight At LTS the mean age result of 71050 ka oprovides a minimum age constraint for the archaeological level in Unit 3.
