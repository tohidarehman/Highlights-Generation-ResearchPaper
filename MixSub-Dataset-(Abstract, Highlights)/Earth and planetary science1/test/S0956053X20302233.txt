 The effect of a biosurfactant rhamnolipid coupled with a thermal treatment was investigated to determine its impact on improving the deflocculation of dehydrated sludge from wastewater treatment processes . Results showed that the RL treatment positively impacted sludge conditioning to weak acidity and hydrolyzed the carbohydrates and proteins released from the matrix of the extracellular polymeric substance . When RL was coupled with high temperature thermal treatments soluble chemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand solubilization increased by 9.619.7 times and 13.429.3 respectively . The RL treatment reduced antibiotic resistant bacteria by 5.498.4 and antibiotic activity was further accelerated by high temperature thermal treatment . The combination of biosurfactant and thermal treatment can effectively deflocculate dehydrated sludge and should be considered an alternative technology for the sludge management process .

@highlight The demands for sludge reduction is increasing due to strengthening regulations on sludge disposal.
@highlight Crude biosurfactant was considered as a cost effective treatment for the deflocculation of dehydrated sludge.
@highlight Rhamnolipids combined with thermal treatment effectively deflocculated the sludge.
@highlight Antibiotic resistance was also reduced following rhamnolipid treatment.
