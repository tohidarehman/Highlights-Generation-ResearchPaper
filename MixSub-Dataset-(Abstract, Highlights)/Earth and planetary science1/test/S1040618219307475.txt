 The clay mineralogy and geochemistry of loess is sensitive to variations in sediment source area transport processes and weathering regime over time and thus careful study of them can provide some insight into past climate variability . The well known loesspaleosol sequences on the Iranian Loess plateau are generally underlain by the red deposits consisting of reddish clay to silt sized sediments of wind blown origin . Study and analyzing of this oldest brown and reddish brown loess has a specific role in paleoclimate reconstruction but no previous study of the clay mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of them has been performed to date . Therefore total Fe

@highlight The clay mineralogy and geochemistry of Lower Pleistocene loess was studied.
@highlight Smectite chlorite illite vermiculite mica vermiculite and mica smectite minerals were detected in the red deposits.
@highlight The presence of smectite and vermiculite is in accordance with the xeric and udic soil moisture regime.
@highlight Clay minerals could be acceptable proxy to deduce paleoclimate.
