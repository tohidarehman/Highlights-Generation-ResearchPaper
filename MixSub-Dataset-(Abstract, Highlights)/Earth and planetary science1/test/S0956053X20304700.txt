 Electronic waste with an annual growth rate of 35 is one of the fastest growing waste streams . The unregulated accumulation and improper recycling can cause grave hazards to human beings and the environment . On the contrary e waste can be considered as a secondary source of metals and energy due to its high metal content and polymeric material . Thus the present study demonstrates technology for the metallic fraction recovery and the production of valuable gases from e waste . The process involves pyrolysis at a temperature range of 200C600C in a fixed bed setup for 1060min . Under optimized operating conditions 35wt combustible gases and 60wt solid product were obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 400C in 20min . The gaseous product consisted of CH
