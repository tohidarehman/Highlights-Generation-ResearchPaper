 This study investigated the morphology and potentially toxic metal concentrations of paper waste based biochar and kitchen waste based biochar obtained at 500 and 700 C. The morphology and potentially toxic metals concentrations in the biochars were determined by SEM and FT IR analysis . The Cr Mn Cu and Cd concentrations in PB were low while the Ba content was relatively high at 0.1mgkg

@highlight The content of potentially toxic metal in KB and PB was low.
@highlight Terminal temperature remarkably affected the morphology of potentially toxic metals in biochar.
@highlight PB and KB were not hazardous waste with low environmental risk.
@highlight PB and KB can fix potentially toxic metal in Tibet soil admirably.
