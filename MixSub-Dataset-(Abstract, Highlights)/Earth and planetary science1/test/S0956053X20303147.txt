 An 8 ton day solid refuse fuel gasification process with air oxidant was operated under various conditions to generate electricity . Solid refuse fuels with fluff type feedstock were fabricated from municipal solid wastes . The tested experimental conditions included feedstock charging rate into the gasifier equivalence ratio and oxygen enrichment varying these conditions resulted in different gasification characteristics such as cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion ratio . Optimum conditions were a charging rate of 50 to 60 by volume 504.71 to 605.65kg Sm

@highlight 8 ton day gasification process was operated using waste fuel for power generation.
@highlight Various experiments were conducted for finding optimal conditions of gasification.
@highlight Average cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion ratio were 71.30 and 72.07 .
@highlight Continuous operation was achieved for about 140h and average power generation 235kW.
@highlight Design factors of commercial process has been derived by successful plant operation.
