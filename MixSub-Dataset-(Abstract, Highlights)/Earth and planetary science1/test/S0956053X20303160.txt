 The Gasification performance of banana peel was examined in a fixed bed reactor . Effect of temperature steam to carbon ratio drying treatment on syngas composition gas yield CO

@highlight The effect of temperature on H
@highlight yield is divided into two control regions.
@highlight S C influences H
@highlight yield mainly through CCE rather than CO
@highlight selectivity.
@highlight Banana peel gasification has great potential for producing H
@highlight Drying treatment contributes to the increase of CO
@highlight selectivity and CCE.
