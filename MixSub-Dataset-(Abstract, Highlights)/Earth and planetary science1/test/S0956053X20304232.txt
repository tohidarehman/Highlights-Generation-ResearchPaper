 Tire scrap is a solid waste that can be potentially used as the feedstock for the production of liquid fuels via the thermochemical process such as catalytic pyrolysis . Nevertheless it remains challenging to develop the efficient while cost effective catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of tire . In this study the pyrolysis of tire scrap at 500C with the biochar produced from the gasification of poplar wood at 850C were conducted . The biochar catalyst significantly affected the evolution of the volatiles and the char properties while had a slight impact on the yields of the gas tar and char products . The biochar catalyst catalyzes the cracking of limonene a major liquid product in tar to form significantly more propane in gases and alkanes or alkenes in the tar . In addition the interaction between the biochar with the oxygen containing organics promoted the re condensation reaction which increased the oxygen content in the char but the biochar catalyst did not influence the evolution of the aromatics . Additionally the catalytic pyrolysis also makes the biochar catalyst more oxygen deficient and more resistant towards oxidation . Concluding all the results showed that biochar which were produced from the gasification of poplar wood can be a potential catalyst for the pyrolysis of tire .
