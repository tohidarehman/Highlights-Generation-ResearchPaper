 We reviewed the nature range and extent of literature on drinking water and human health outcomes in the context of climate change in the Circumpolar North . We used a systematic process to identify and synthesize articles . While the number of climate water health articles increased recently this topic remains under studied despite the transformational changes that the Circumpolar North has already experienced due to climate change . Of the climate focused articles most considered climate change to a major extent and discussed waterborne infections . Research examining and evaluating adaptation options and future impacts at the climate water health nexus is absent in the Circumpolar North . Responding to this research gap should become a top priority for research given the urgent need for this evidence to inform climate change policies actions and interventions .

@highlight Arctic climate water health research has increased over time but remains nascent.
@highlight Most research considering climate change took place in rural and or remote locales.
@highlight The majority of climate focused articles discussed waterborne infections.
@highlight Research examining climate water health adaptation was rare.
@highlight No articles quantitatively projected climate change impacts on drinking water.
