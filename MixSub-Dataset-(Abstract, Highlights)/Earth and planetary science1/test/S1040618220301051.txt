 The Three Gorges Valley linking the upper and the middle lower Yangtze River areas is a key area for understanding the geomorphological evolution of the Yangtze River valley especially the timing of its formation which remains controversial and occurred following the authors to from the pre Miocene to Late Pleistocene periods . The 100m thick Yichang Gravel Layer extending over an area 100km

@highlight Yichang Gravel Layer YGL represents the first sediment deposition phase after the incision of the Three Gorges valley.
@highlight Heavy mineral study shows that YGL materials were mainly sourced from the upper Yangtze River Basin.
@highlight ESR chronology indicates that YGL was deposited between 1.12Ma and 0.73Ma.
@highlight The incision of the Three Gorges valley was therefore realized before.
