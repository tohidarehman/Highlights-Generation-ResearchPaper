 Catalytic conversion of xylose and the hemicellulose fraction of waste biomass to furfural is important for the valorization of waste lignocellulose . Here a clean and efficient catalytic system consisting of sulfonated carbon microspheres catalysts and valerolactone was developed for the upgrading of xylose and waste lignocellulose to the furfural in one pot . Sulfonated carbon microspheres C
