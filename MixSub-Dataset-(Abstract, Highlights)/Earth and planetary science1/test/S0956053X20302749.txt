 The volume of end of life automotive batteries is increasing rapidly as a result of growing electric vehicle adoption . Most automotive lithium ion batteries are recycled but could be repurposed as second life batteries since they have 7080 residual capacity which can be adequate for stationary applications . SLBs have been proposed as potential inexpensive low carbon energy storage for residential and utility level applications with or without photovoltaics . However it is unknown whether SLBs will be better than new batteries and whether SLBs will provide similar cost and carbon emission reduction for the different stationary applications in all locations . This work compared the levelized cost of electricity and life cycle carbon emissions associated with using SLBs and new LIBs in the US for three energy storage applications residential energy storage with rooftop PV utility level PV firming and utility level peak shaving leading to a total of 41 scenarios . SLBs reduced the levelized cost of electricity by 1257 and carbon emissions by 731 compared to new LIBs in the considered applications with higher reductions for utility level applications . SLBs still provided benefits at the residential level when compared to rooftop PV alone by reducing the levelized cost by 1525 and carbon emissions by 2251 making SLBs attractive to residential consumers as well . SLBs offer an opportunity to utilize an end of life product for energy storage applications provided the uncertainty in SLB quality and availability is addressed .

@highlight End of life EV batteries can be used for energy storage.
@highlight Second life batteries offer lower cost versus new batteries for stationary storage.
@highlight They offer lower carbon emissions versus new batteries for stationary storage.
@highlight Utility level storage benefits depend on grid carbon emission and solar irradiance.
