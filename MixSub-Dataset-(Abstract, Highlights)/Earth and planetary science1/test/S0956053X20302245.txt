 The scope of this research is to present a more holistic approach on measuring countries performance in managing and exploiting their Municipal Solid Waste . Specifically we argue that relying solely on criteria like the recycling and or the cyclical material use rate can lead to an overestimation or underestimation of countries true performance . That is because the level of waste generation is left unaccounted despite the fact that low waste generation is an important environmental target and so is the countries true potential as it is reflected by their economic and social progress .
