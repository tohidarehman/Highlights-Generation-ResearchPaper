 The stratotype section of Paks brickyard provides the most detailed accessible loess paleosol sequence from almost the entire Pleistocene in the middle part of the Carpathian Basin . The best and thickest loess archives of Hungary are preserved in this part of the basin and now two more drilling cores were deepened in this area on plateau position on loessic ridges PA I and PA II .
