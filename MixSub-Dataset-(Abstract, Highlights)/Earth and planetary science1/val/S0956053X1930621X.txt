 Maximizing resource recovery from waste streams is a critical challenge for municipalities . Utilizing the ultimate analysis and high heat value we investigated the energy recovery and emission characteristics for 252 solid wastes of a diverse range of geographical origins classifications under the thermal waste to energy operation . Given the significance of wastes HHV data we proposed a rapid and cost effective methodology for filling the gaps in the experimental data by prediction of the missing or uncertain wastes HHV . We further employed wastes nitrogen and sulphur contents to assess their atmospheric emissions . The results from this analysis show the highest energy content belonged to plastic waste but higher levels of air pollution could be emitted during thermal energy recovery of sewage sludge rubber and textile wastes . Also we demonstrated more significant potential for recovering energy from plastic wood and paper wastes while emitting less nitrogen and sulphur compounds to the atmosphere . Finally our presented HHV models outperform concerning generalizability validity and accuracy when comparing the obtained results to those of previously published models . The results from this present study are particularly advantageous in designing sustainable thermal waste to energy systems to facilitate cities transition into a circular economy .

@highlight A rapid and cost effective approach for accurate modeling of HHV is proposed.
@highlight 252 experimental MSW data from a diverse geographical origins are utilized.
@highlight Our proposed HHV models outperform the accuracy of the previous studies.
