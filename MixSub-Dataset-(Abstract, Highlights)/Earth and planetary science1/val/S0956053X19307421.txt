 One of the solutions for decreasing the workers exposure to bioburden is the use of Filtering Respiratory Protective Devices . As such it is important to determine whether these devices are fulfilling their protective role . This is the basis of the current study aimed at characterizing bioburden retained by 120 FRPD through culture based methods and molecular tools and also via analysis of antifungal resistance and mycotoxins profile . Our results show that Gram Bacteria are present at a higher prevalence than total bacteria in both matrixes . Regarding fungal identification

@highlight Filtering Respiratory Protective Devices FRPD presented high levels of bioburden.
@highlight Several
@highlight sections exhibited reduced susceptibility to the tested azoles.
@highlight Toxigenic fungal strains were detected on FRPD.
@highlight Workers with more waste contact showed increased bioburden on FRPD.
@highlight FRPD can be used as passive sampling methods to assess occupational exposure.
