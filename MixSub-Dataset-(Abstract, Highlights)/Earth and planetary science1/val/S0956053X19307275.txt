 Almost 500 municipal solid waste incineration plants in the EU Norway and Switzerland generate about 17.6 Mt a of incinerator bottom ash . IBA contains minerals and metals . Metals are mostly separated and sold to the scrap market and minerals are either disposed of in landfills or utilised in the construction sector . Since there is no uniform regulation for IBA utilisation at EU level countries developed own rules with varying requirements for utilisation . As a result from a cooperation network between European experts an up to date overview of documents regulating IBA utilisation is presented . Furthermore this work highlights the different requirements that have to be considered . Overall 51 different parameters for the total content and 36 different parameters for the emission by leaching are defined . An analysis of the defined parameter reveals that leaching parameters are significantly more to be considered compared to total content parameters . In order to assess the leaching behaviour nine different leaching tests including batch tests up flow percolation tests and one diffusion test are in place . A further discussion of leaching parameters showed that certain countries took over limit values initially defined for landfills for inert waste and adopted them for IBA utilisation . The overall utilisation rate of IBA in construction works is approximately 54wt . It is revealed that the rate of utilisation does not necessarily depend on how well regulated IBA utilisation is but rather seems to be a result of political commitment for IBA recycling and economically interesting circumstances .
