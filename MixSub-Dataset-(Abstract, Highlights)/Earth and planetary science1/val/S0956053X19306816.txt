 In the present study anaerobic sludge was subjected to thermal and chemical pretreatments to favour VFAs production from a protein rich waste . Sludge pretreatments have been previously used in hydrogen production however information about how they can affect VFAs production from microalgae is still lacking . Thermal pretreatment was studied at 80C for 10 and 30min 120C for 10 and 30min and 100C for 20min . 2 bromoethanesulfonate at 10mM and 30mM was used as chemical pretreatment . Besides a combination of both pretreatment methods was also tested . Thermal pretreatment increased organic matter conversions into VFAs up to 71 COD VFAs COD

@highlight Anaerobic microbial biomass was more suitable than aerobic biomass.
@highlight Methane production contributed to VFAs consumption.
@highlight Anaerobic sludge thermal pretreatment maximized VFAs conversion yields.
@highlight 70 VFAs COD COD
@highlight conversion yield was attained at 120C for 10min.
@highlight VFAs distribution profile was sensitive to anaerobic sludge pretreatments.
