 Instrument bundles placed within the Ste . Sophie landfill have been collecting temperature and settlement data since January 2010 . Previous modelling efforts simulated settlement based on a three component model to account for primary or instantaneous compression secondary compression or mechanical creep and time dependent biodegradation induced settlement . In northern climates where waste may be placed under frozen conditions a time dependent biodegradation induced settlement term is unable to simulate settlement due to biodegradation as waste temperatures transition from below zero to optimal values for anaerobic degradation . This paper presents a temperature dependent biodegration induced settlement model . The model simulates heat generation as a function of temperature and tracks the expended energy as the waste degrades . The ratio of the expended energy to the total potential expended energy is used in the proposed temperature dependent biodegradation induced settlement term . The new term better accounts for the delayed biodegradation process observed in wastes placed under frozen conditions . The model was able to simulate the settlement trends observed at the Ste . Sophie landfill . The goal of developing and including a temperature dependent biodegradation induced settlement term in the model was to study the effects of operating conditions on waste settlement and stabilization . An optimized waste lift placement strategy could enhance waste stabilization and improve the airspace utilization within a landfill simultaneously bringing increased revenues to landfill operators while decreasing the post closure environmental burden of landfills .
