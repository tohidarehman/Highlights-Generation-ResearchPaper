 Biochar is a pyrogenous organic material resulting from the pyrolysis of organic residues which is attracting the interest from researchers and farmers for its potential to sequester carbon and its use as soil ameliorant . Pyrolysis conditions and feedstock determine the properties of the biochars produced . In order to understand the relationship between these variables we analysed in detail the physical chemical and surface characteristics of biochars produced from three contrasting agronomic residues abundantly generated in South Spain such as rice husk olive pit and pruning remains of olive trees using a temperature range from 350 to 600C and residence times from 0.5 to 4h . High pyrolysis temperature and time resulted in the greatest pH and C content in the biochars . In general elemental composition and ash content were dependent on the type of organic waste used as feedstock .

@highlight Effects of pyrolysis conditions on the biochar properties of three different organic waste.
@highlight Biochars from rice husk olive pit and olive prunings were produced and characterized.
@highlight C and N content mainly depended on biochar feedstock.
@highlight Aryl C alkylC and hydrophobicity were predominately influenced by residence time.
@highlight Feedstock and pyrolysis temperature conditioned water holding capacity and ash content.
