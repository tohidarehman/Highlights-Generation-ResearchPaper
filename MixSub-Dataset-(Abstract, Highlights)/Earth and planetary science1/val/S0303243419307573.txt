 Wetlands have been determined as one of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth and are currently being lost at alarming rates . Large scale monitoring of wetlands is of high importance but also challenging . The Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite missions for the first time provide radar and optical data at high spatial and temporal detail and with this a unique opportunity for more accurate wetland mapping from space arises . Recent studies already used Sentinel 1 and 2 data to map specific wetland types or characteristics but for comprehensive wetland characterisations the potential of the data has not been researched yet . The aim of our research was to study the use of the high resolution and temporally dense Sentinel 1 and 2 data for wetland mapping in multiple levels of characterisation . The use of the data was assessed by applying Random Forests for multiple classification levels including general wetland delineation wetland vegetation types and surface water dynamics . The results for the St. Lucia wetlands in South Africa showed that combining Sentinel 1 and 2 led to significantly higher classification accuracies than for using the systems separately . Accuracies were relatively poor for classifications in high vegetated wetlands as subcanopy flooding could not be detected with Sentinel 1s C band sensors operating in VV VH mode . When excluding high vegetated areas overall accuracies were reached of 88.5 for general wetland delineation 90.7 for mapping wetland vegetation types and 87.1 for mapping surface water dynamics . Sentinel 2 was particularly of value for general wetland delineation while Sentinel 1 showed more value for mapping wetland vegetation types . Overlaid maps of all classification levels obtained overall accuracies of 69.1 and 76.4 for classifying ten and seven wetland classes respectively .
