 Large scale land change maps are essential to support policies addressing land transformations . Calibration and validation of large scale land change maps require reference data that are commonly acquired by visual interpretation of remotely sensed images . However visual interpretation itself is prone to error . Little is known about factors influencing the quality and consistency of changes detected by visual interpretation . This paper reports on an experiment assessing the effect of the number of very high resolution images and land change process types on the consistency of visual interpretations . The experiment involved 48 sites scattered over Europe for which 18 individuals interpreted very high resolution images which were provided via Google Earth . Land change process type was found to have a significant impact on the consistency of visual interpretations while the marginal effect of the number of images was not significant . Absence of change on non agricultural land was interpreted with high consistency . On the contrary agricultural land abandonment and reforestation were the least consistent in their interpretation . We conclude that for increased efficiency resources allocated to acquire reference data by visual interpretation should be adjusted based on the expected type of land change . Interpretation of agricultural land abandonment reforestation and agricultural land expansion require most efforts .

@highlight Land change process type had a significant impact on interpretation consistency.
@highlight The number of available images had no significant effect.
@highlight Absence of change of non agricultural land was most consistently interpreted.
@highlight Land abandonment reforestation and agricultural expansion were least consistent.
