 Ammonia and odour emissions from one lagoon and three tanks used for slurry storage were sampled for two years in livestock farms that differed for animal breeding and manure management .

@highlight The storage facilities for animal manure determine ammonia and odour emissions.
@highlight These emissions cause environmental problems and annoyance to inhabitants.
@highlight The determination of emission rates is useful to quantify these problems.
@highlight Ammonia and odours have been detected studying four storage facilities during two years.
@highlight Both ammonia and odour emitted depended upon slurries characteristics and environmental parameters.
