 The fast pyrolysis of waste tires is studied by quasi isothermal thermogravimetric analysis kinetic modelling and an analytical pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry . The TGA demonstrated that the WTs pyrolysis is ruled by devolatilization condensation and depropagation reactions up to 482C . At higher temperatures the cyclization and aromatization of primary products take place to form mostly monoaromatics . Py GC MS experiments were performed under kinetic regime according to the thermal map established by the ratio between Biots and Py numbers 7.710
