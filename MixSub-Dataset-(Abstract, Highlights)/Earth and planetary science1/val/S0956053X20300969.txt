 In the South Tyrol region 46 gasifiers are currently operating and 200 000 are annually paid to dispose of as a waste 1300 tons of char . Therefore there is a considerable interest in finding alternatives for the valorization of this solid by product . The aim of this work is to assess the potential of char as energy source and to compare two scenarios . The first scenario considers the possibility of exploiting char in a dedicated burner integrated in the gasification plant . The second scenario assumes that all the char is collected from South Tyrol and co fired with biomass in an existing combustion ORC plant . An economic analysis was performed evaluating the discounted payback time and both scenarios were modeled using Aspen Plus . The results reveal that substantial savings in the operating costs of the plants can be achieved . In the first scenario the owners of the gasification plants could save from 50 to 94 of the char disposal costs with a payback time ranging between 3 and 7years . In the second scenario the owner of the plant could save approximately 235k per year with a payback time of approximately 7years . The present study provides a basis for further techno economic studies on char combustion . The results can be helpful for the owners of the gasification plants in determining the most cost effective way to dispose char and to avoid disposing it of as a waste . Furthermore it is demonstrated how char could be used as a renewable fuel with better performance than raw biomass .

@highlight Techno economic potentialities of gasification char as energy source are assessed.
@highlight Biomass and char gasification and combustion processes are modeled.
@highlight The use of char can reduce the operating costs of biomass plants.
@highlight Payback time of the char combustion equipment can be lower than 4years.
