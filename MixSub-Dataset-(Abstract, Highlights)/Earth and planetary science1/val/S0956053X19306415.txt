 Goal of the work was to compare the respiration activities as measured via oxygen consumption with three different organic waste stability methods so that to propose the optimal one . The novelty of the work is that there exists no comparison of solid phase with liquid phase stability assessment techniques in the literature . The respiration activities were assessed using two solid phase methods and a manometric liquid phase method performed on twenty seven organic substrates . The methods rely on measuring oxygen consumption via pressure drops or via direct O

@highlight A liquid phase stability test MANLIQ was compared to 2 solid phase stability tests.
@highlight The respiration indices order was Dynamic MANLIQStatic.
@highlight The strongest correlation was between the liquid and the static solid phase indices.
@highlight The ratio of the liquid indices to the static solid phase indices was 1.62.7.
@highlight The solid phase tests should be preferred over the liquid test to assess stability.
