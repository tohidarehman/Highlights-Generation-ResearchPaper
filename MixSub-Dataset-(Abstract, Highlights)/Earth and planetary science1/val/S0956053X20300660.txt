 Penicillin V mycelial residue is a byproduct of the pharmaceutical industry and may be disposed through land application after alkaline thermal treatment . However the efficacy of alkaline thermally treated PMR in soil amelioration and the potential contamination risk caused by introduced penicillin V are poorly understood . In this study soil pH the contents of organic matter available phosphorus available potassium were measured to study the effect of alkaline thermally treated PMR on soil fertility the numbers of culturable microorganisms and the activities of enzymes which not only reflect the decomposing ability of organic matter but also monitor the ecological suppression in soil ecosystem were also investigated moreover the persistence of introduced penicillin V and the variation of antibiotic resistance genes in soil were examined to evaluate the resulting antibiotic resistance risk . The results indicated that the pH and the content of available potassium in amended soil with treated PMR profoundly improved . In addition the culturable microorganisms and enzymes were not inhibited throughout the incubation of treated PMR in soil . The stability of treated PMR in soil relatively completed after 43days . More importantly the penicillin V derived by treated PMR rapidly depleted within 3days which suggested a relatively low environmental persistence . The treated PMR did not enrich the ARGs detected in soil demonstrating that the addition of treated PMR might not trigger the antibiotic resistance risk in the short term in soil . In conclusion our results concluded that alkaline thermally treated PMR is available for soil application .

@highlight The alkaline thermally treated PMR improved soil properties.
@highlight Soil microorganisms and enzymes were not suppressed during the incubation.
@highlight The alkaline thermally treated PMR in soil nearly matured after 43days.
@highlight The introduced penicillin V in soil could not persist and dissipated within 3days.
@highlight The alkaline thermally treated PMR did not enrich the ARGs in soil.
