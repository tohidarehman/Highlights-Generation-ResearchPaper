 Tourism contributes substantially to municipal solid waste generation yet the waste from tourism systematically remains hidden behind residential waste flows . As a result municipal fees are set without precise information about waste producers contributions causing budget imbalances and cross subsidies between residential and economic activities . To estimate tourisms contribution to mixed waste generation in an island destination socio demographic economic and disposal related factors are modelled using municipal panel data from 2004 to 2015 for Tenerife . In contrast to previous studies a mixed demand supply approach is adopted to estimate the contribution of main tourism activities to mixed waste generation thus differentiating between tourists and residents contributions . An auxiliary model is used to isolate employment levels in tourism activities attributable to residents consumption and to capture tourists and residents mobility on the island . Estimates show that main tourism activities generate 0.40kg of mixed waste per tourist daily while residential and economic sectors account for 1.19kg per resident daily . This tourism contribution is significantly lower compared to other studies as it captures tourisms contribution to mixed waste generation attributable only to tourists following a mixed demand supply approach . These results shift impacts from tourists to main tourism activities which highlights the choices made by producers rather than the final customers and reinforces the producers extended responsibility principle . The implementation of a Pay As You Throw tariff for mixed waste is discussed as a way of promoting waste prevention and recycling as well as avoiding cross subsidies among waste producers and as a result imbalances in municipal budgets .

@highlight Island destinations are ideal to study the impact of tourism on MSW generation.
@highlight A demand supply approach gives precise estimates of tourism contribution to MSW.
@highlight A demand supply approach considers the residents consumption in tourism activities.
@highlight Accommodation and Food and Beverages are the main tourism activities generating MSW.
