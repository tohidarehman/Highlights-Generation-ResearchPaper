 Co digestion of blackwater and organic kitchen waste is a promising and effective resource recovery based approach for municipal waste and wastewater treatment . In this study anaerobic co digestion treatments of BW and KW using anaerobic sequencing batch reactors under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions were compared . Our results showed that although higher sludge specific methanogenesis activities were observed in the thermophilic reactor mesophilic treatment achieved significantly higher treatment capacity and methane production . It was concluded that thermophilic conditions introduced H

@highlight Blackwater BW and kitchen organic waste KW were co digested with optimized VS ratio 1 2 .
@highlight Co digestion of BW with KW improved energy recovery efficiency and reactor treatment capacity.
@highlight The mesophilic reactor MR achieved higher organic loading rate than the thermophilic reactor TR .
@highlight The MR achieved higher methane recovery efficiencies up to 83 .
@highlight The poor performance of the TR was caused by H
@highlight inhiation introduced under higher temperature.
