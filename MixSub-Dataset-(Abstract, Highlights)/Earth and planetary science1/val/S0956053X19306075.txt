 Biosolarization utilizes organic amendments to produce biopesticide compounds in soil that can work in tandem with other stresses to inactivate agricultural pests . The prospect of using by products from industrial almond processing as amendments for biosolarization was assessed . Soil mesocosms were used to simulate biosolarization using various almond by products application rates and incubation times . Several potentially biopesticidal organic acids were identified and quantified in the soil and the toxicity of soil extracts was evaluated for the root lesion nematode

@highlight Feasibility of almond by products was demonstrated for use in biosolarization.
@highlight Treated soils experienced pH depression and organic acid accumulation.
@highlight Residue application to soil resulted in 84100 nematode inactivation.
@highlight Both endogenous and fermentative organic acids likely contribute to efficacy.
