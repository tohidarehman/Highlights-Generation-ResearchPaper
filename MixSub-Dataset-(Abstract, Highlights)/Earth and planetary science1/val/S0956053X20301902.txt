 In the last decade door to door waste collection methods have been largely applied by several municipalities in Italy with the main purpose to achieve higher rates of sorted waste . This approach requires waste collectors to handle a high number of small waste containers during their work shift especially in urban areas and historic city centres . Workers may experience ergonomic issues during door to door waste collection due to the characteristics of the waste containers the waste collection equipment the work organization and citizens behaviour . If not well planned and managed this activity may expose waste collectors to ergonomic risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders .

@highlight During Door to Door Waste Collection DDWC workers experience ergonomic issues.
@highlight This study introduces organic green and residual DDWC practises in a city centre.
@highlight Four decisional variables for DDWC practises are identified.
@highlight Ergonomics analysis reveals the impact of decisional variables on workers safety.
@highlight Results shows that DDWC can be a sustainable activity if well analysed and managed.
