 Waste printed circuit boards contain a large amount of brominated epoxy resins which may cause environmental problems . However BERs degradation under mild conditions is challenging due to the good thermal and chemical stabilities of BERs . This study proposes a mild and efficient method that uses subcritical acetic acid to decompose BERs . BERs swell quickly at 200C and are thoroughly decomposed into bisphenol A and phenol at 220C when the acetic acid mass concentration and holding time are fixed at 49.90 and 1h respectively . Experimental results show that subcritical acetic acid has excellent swelling and catalytic degradation effects on BERs . The quick swelling of BERs allows the free migration of the catalyst in the epoxy network and thus significantly enhances the catalytic degradation effect . Therefore BERs can be thoroughly decomposed by subcritical acetic acid under mild conditions . Temperature and acetic acid concentration are the major parameters that control the resin degradation rate . Bromine free oil phase products are obtained at 240C . The possible decomposition pathway of BERs in subcritical acetic acid is also investigated . Most of the bromine is transformed into HBr and enriched in the aqueous phase . In conclusion the proposed mild method could be used as a novel practical and industrial procedure for the degradation and debromination of BERs .
