 Many studies have sought to optimize operation parameters and enhance the treatment capacity of bioreactor landfills under ideal laboratory conditions . At pilot scale conclusions drawn from laboratory scale experiments will be different due to variations in actual landfill composition and changes in environmental conditions . However comparative pilot scale studies of traditional anaerobic landfills and BLs are rare . In this study three pilot scale landfills including an AnL anaerobic BL and semi aerobic BL were monitored to examine the difference in performance at different scales and among types of landfills . Settlement amount followed the order SABL AnBL AnL . Decomposition of organic matter was more rapid in SABL than in the other landfills and no hydrolytic acidification period was observed . Therefore among the three landfills SABL entered the methanogenic stage in a much shorter time and MSW stabilization was accelerated due to this landfills unique combination of aerobic anoxic anaerobic ambient . In addition NH

@highlight The performance differences of three pilot scale landfills were investigated.
@highlight MSW stabilization in the SABL was greatly accelerated.
@highlight NH
@highlight N in SABL leachate was substantially lower than that from the other landfills.
@highlight SABL leachate exhibited the least chloride pollution risk.
