 Heat recovery from composting processes and its use as a source of bioenergy have come into prominence in recent years . In this study the selection of an adequate bulking agent for the composting of the solid fraction of pig slurry has been based on the heat produced by the microbial activity during aerobic degradation of the organic matter . Residues of five plant species typical of the Mediterranean area were mixed with the solid fraction of pig slurry as bulking agents . The residues were the prunings of three common cultivated tree species and the biomass of two herbaceous species . Self heating tests were run for 18days in thermally insulated laboratory scale reactors the energy released as heat was calculated from the temperature increase inside the reactors . The mixtures were sampled at the beginning and end of the experiment and the microbial stability was evaluated by aerobic respiration tests . The heat energy produced was highest in the mixture with milk thistle 18.31.78MJkg

@highlight Lignocellulosic plant residues were evaluated as bulking agents for composting.
@highlight Self heating experiments of pig slurry with plant residues were run in 5 L reactors.
@highlight Energy produced during the self heating experiments was determined.
@highlight Heat energy produced was compared with higher heating values.
@highlight Chemical properties of plant residues conditioned heat release and microbial activity.
