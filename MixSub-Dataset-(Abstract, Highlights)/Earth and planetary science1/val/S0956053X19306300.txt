 A novel and efficient approach for stepwise recycling of valuable metals from Ni rich cathode material is developed . First the spent cathode materials are leached by H

@highlight Stepwise recovering metal values from spent Ni rich cathode material was developed.
@highlight Mn and Co were co extracted from leaching liquor of spent Ni rich cathode material.
@highlight Ni and Li were separated by solvent extraction with neodecanoic acid.
