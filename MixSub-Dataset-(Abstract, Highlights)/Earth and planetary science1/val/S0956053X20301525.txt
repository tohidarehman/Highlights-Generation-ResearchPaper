 Efficient reduction of environmental pollution caused by waste polyethylene terephthalate and production of carbon nanomaterials are desirable for nanotechnology printable electronics composites and environment protection . Here we report a simple top down micro nano fabrication process to prepare fibrous carbon nanomaterial from waste PET bottles . This process is highly efficient facile and catalyst free in preparing fibrous carbon nanomaterial with promising hydrophobic and electrical properties . The fibrous carbon nanomaterial can be used both in the form of sheet or powder and it supplies a versatile surface for preparing novel carbon based composites with significant optical properties and conductivity . The prepared carbon nanomaterial from waste PET has also been used in fabricating strain sensor with good durability .
