 Manure from lactating and non lactating water buffaloes was separately collected from a single dairy farm and anaerobically digested under mesophilic conditions in batch mode to produce biogas . This substrate scarcely studied in the literature showed two peculiarities regarding two fundamental parameters in the digestion processes C N ratio and initial pH . Typically optimal C N varies from 20 to 30 but in this work an almost negligible role of this ratio is observed . We demonstrated it by investigating a very large C N interval from 9.7 to 50.1 not by adding selected nutrients to the system but exploiting the natural variation of the substrate . Concerning the pH we show that also typically considered unfavorable conditions are feasible for this substrate . In fact though neutral basic initial pH is proved to be optimal to run the digestion process in line with many other kinds of dungs also acid initial pH leads to satisfactory CH

@highlight Anaerobic digestion of water buffalo manure is studied in batch mode at 37C.
@highlight This substrate has two peculiarities regarding C N and initial pH role in digestion.
@highlight High CH
@highlight yields 50 are obtained with C N far from the typical optimal values.
@highlight pH
@highlight confirms its pivotal role in digestion and favourable values are 7.07.5.
@highlight Manure shows the capability of auto regulating pH from acid 56 to neutral value.
