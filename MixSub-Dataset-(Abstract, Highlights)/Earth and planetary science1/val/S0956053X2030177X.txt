 The coordinated treatment for two kinds of waste is an effective way to save energy and improve the recovery efficiency of resource . In worldwide more than half of palladium is used to produce catalysts in automobile . However with the increasing consumption of palladium the scarcity of palladium resource is becoming prominent . This paper proposed an integrated process based on capture of copper scrap and electrodeposition process to recycle palladium in spent catalysis from automobile . The technological process mainly consisted of two procedures capture of copper scrap with the purposes of enriching palladium and electrodeposition process with the purposes of separating and purifying palladium . Several highlights were summarized as follows a capture mechanism of palladium by copper scrap was studied by the calculation of surface thermodynamics and first principles . Optimum designs parameter and product analysis were developed to guide industrial recycling . The appropriate parameters for capture of copper scrap are the melting temperature reached 1400C adding 20 dosage of copper scrap and 2 of mass ratio of SiO
