 Brazil stands out as one of the largest world powers in the agribusiness sector and with the increase of production capacity an enormous amount of waste is generated that cause serious environmental problems . Acerola is evidenced as one of the fruits of growing and important commercialization contributing significantly to regional development through the export of concentrated powder product . Thus in order to minimize the environmental impacts generated by the local fruit processing industry the proximate analysis of its residue after drying in a convective oven at temperatures of 50 75 and 100C was carried out in this work aiming at the reuse of this residue for thermochemical processes . Moisture ash volatile matter and fixed carbon content were analyzed as well as characterizations such as infrared spectroscopy elemental analysis calorific value and thermogravimetry . The results showed a significant difference in the moisture contents VM FC and elemental carbon for the dry residue at 50C compared to the temperatures of 75 and 100C while for the ash content there was no significant difference between the temperatures . The dry acerola residue at the three temperatures studied presented adequate properties for thermochemical application with lignocellulosic compounds that can be converted by thermochemical route good levels of calorific power low moisture and ash content associated with high amount of volatile matter .

@highlight The drying temperature led to significant differences in physicochemical contents.
@highlight The biomass maintained the structure of functional groups after thermal treatment.
@highlight The high value of volatile matter content is suitable for the pyrolytic processes.
@highlight The HHV H C and O C ratios were analogous to biomasses used in energy generation.
