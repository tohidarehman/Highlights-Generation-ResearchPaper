 Cattle manure is a major livestock waste in agroecosystem and in situ catalytic pyrolysis is considered as a potential technology for its disposal . In order to increase the gas production during cattle manure pyrolysis and alleviate the problem of frequent regeneration separation of the in situ catalyst a strategy of in situ catalytic pyrolysis was proposed in this work in which the pyrolytic char product was not separated from the pyrolysis catalyst of NiO Al

@highlight A cyclic in situ catalytic cattle manure pyrolysis strategy was proposed.
@highlight The pyrolytic char product was recycled as a co catalyst with NiO Al
@highlight The initial NiO Al
@highlight catalyst could be almost regenerated completely.
@highlight The activity of the initial NiO Al
@highlight catalyst did not reduce after regeneration.
@highlight The char can improve the catalysis activity through in situ reduction of NiO.
