 Several methods have been proposed to delineate management zones in agricultural fields which can guide interventions of the farmers to increase crop yield . In this study we propose a new approach using remote sensing data to delineate management zones at three farm sites located in southern Brazil . The approach is based on the hypothesis that the measured aboveground biomass of the cover crops is correlated with the measured cash crop yield and can be estimated from surface reflectance and or vegetation indices . Therefore we used seven different statistical models to estimate AGB of three cover crops in the season prior to cash crop planting . Surface reflectance and VIs were used as predictors to test the performance of the models . They were obtained from high spatial and temporal resolution data of the PlanetScope constellation of satellites . From the time series of 30 images acquired in 2017 we used the PS data that matched the dates of the field campaigns to build the models . The results showed that the satellite AGB estimates of the cover crops at the date of maximum VI response at the beginning of the flowering stage were useful to delineate the management zones . The cover crop AGB models that presented the highest coefficient of determination R

@highlight We delineated management zones using cover crop AGB estimates from PlanetScope data.
@highlight Cover crop AGB forage turnip white oats rye was correlated with cash crop yield.
@highlight Four of seven regression models SVM SGB CUB and RF had similar AGB performance.
@highlight Management zones from cover crop AGB agreed with those from cash crop yields.
@highlight Cover crop AGB estimates at the date of maximum VI were a proxy of management zones.
