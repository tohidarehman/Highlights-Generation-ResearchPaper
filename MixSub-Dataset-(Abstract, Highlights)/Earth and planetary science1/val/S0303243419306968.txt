 Satellite remote sensing is an effective method for extracting water bodies on a large scale . Radar imagery such as synthetic aperture radar imagery can penetrate clouds and provide opportunities for water body identification when in situ observations are difficult to obtain because of severe weather conditions . However when using SAR images in urban areas to extract water bodies the radars double bounce effect results in complicated backscatter patterns of water near urban features such as buildings due to the side looking properties of SAR sensors and the vertical urban structures . Therefore the objective of this study is to propose a reliable urban water extraction framework for SAR images that integrates urban surface morphological features for controlling radars multiple bounces . Statistical and machine learning models were used to explore how radars double bounce effect influences the prediction performance of urban water extraction . Our findings indicate that when extracting urban water bodies urban waters backscatter values could be significantly interfered by the neighboring building density above a threshold height that contributes to radars multiple bounces . Without model calibration our framework incorporating urban surface morphology demonstrates high prediction ability with an Area Under the Curve of 0.914 and with 97.0 of urban water cells correctly identified by testing in another city sharing similar urban forms . In summary our study provides a better understanding of the role of the urban surface morphology in the double bounce effect in SAR images specifically for differentiating urban water and land thereby improving the accuracy of urban water extraction and enhancing the feasibility of further applications of SAR imagery under complex urban landscapes .
