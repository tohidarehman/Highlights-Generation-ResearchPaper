 Sequential potassium hydroxide phosphoric acid activation was applied to biomass waste to fabricate activated carbon microspheres with a controllable porous structure . Carbon microspheres were first synthesized from xylose using a bottom up approach of hydrothermal carbonization . Sequential KOH and H

@highlight Activated porous carbon microsphere was synthesized from biomass derived xylose.
@highlight A controllable porous structure was fabricated by sequential base acid activation.
@highlight The large surface area and acid site on surface enhanced the specific capacitance.
