 Waste printed circuit boards contain a variety of valuable and hazardous materials . Recycling WPCBs is an important subject not only for environmental protection but also for sustainable development of resources . In this work a new method combined low temperature alkaline smelting with liquid liquid phase separation is proposed to separate and recycle metal mixture in pyrolysis residue of WPCBs of mobile phones . During the low temperature alkaline smelting process amphoteric metals Al Pb Si Sn and Zn are firstly separated and recycled from the metal mixture with the separation rates of 99.5 81.6 97.8 88.4 and 95.7 respectively . To separate the remaining metal mixture mainly containing elements Cu Fe Cr Ni Au and Ag a liquid liquid phase separation system is designed . As a result the noble metals Au and Ag are concentrated in the copper rich substance to form a high value group while the elements Ni and Cr distribute in the iron rich substance . The iron rich substance can be reused in the liquid liquid phase separation process . In the super gravity field the recycling rates of the metals Au Ag Cr and Ni reach 98.1 99.8 95.6 and 75.4 respectively . Furthermore the iron rich substance can be reused back to the liquid liquid separation system . The copper rich substance enriched by the noble metals can be efficiently recovered with low energy consumption and less pollution . This work provides an environmentally friendly and efficient route for separating and recycling the metal mixture in WPCBs .
