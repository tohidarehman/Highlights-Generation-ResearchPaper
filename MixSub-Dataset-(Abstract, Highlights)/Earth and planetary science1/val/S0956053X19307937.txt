 A substitution based method for chromium leaching from chromium tanned leather waste without destroying the collagen matrix was proposed . The leaching efficiency of Cr from CTLW using different organic salts was investigated and sodium oxalate was considered to be the best Cr leaching agent . The effects of leaching time temperature pH concentration shaking speed and leather thickness on Cr leaching rate were investigated and a Cr leaching rate of 98 was obtained . Thermodynamic parameters
