 Hydrochars are materials with a promising future as their high carbon content and porosity renders them suitable for uses including peat substitutes soil remediation and carbon adsorbent precursors . Combining hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis offers the prospect to provide advanced materials with a higher porosity and carbon content . This approach would mitigate drawbacks associated to hydrochars including phytotoxicity . This research studied the influence of pyrolysis temperature and heating time on the resulting properties of chars made from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass wastes at 200C for 4h and compared them to biochars that had not received any prior hydrothermal carbonization . Interestingly hydrochar followed by pyrolysis was able to result in phytostimulation while when only pyrolysis was carried out phytotoxicity was eliminated but no phytostimulant effect was observed . In addition the results indicated that the higher and longer the pyrolysis temperature and duration time respectively the more microporosity was generated while phytotoxicity was reduced . In addition aromaticity and thermal stability significantly increased with pyrolysis treatment . Consequently hydrochars improve their properties and offer more potential for environmental applications after a pyrolysis post treatment .

@highlight Pyrolysis used as post treatment to improve hydrochar.
@highlight Treated hydrochars become less phytotoxic.
@highlight Hydrothermal carbonization pyrolysis resulted in better pore development.
@highlight Pyrolysis at 550C during 5h increases BET of hydrochar to more than 130m
