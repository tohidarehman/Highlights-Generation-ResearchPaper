 There is a growing search for alternative raw materials to obtain collagen and hydrolysates and processes that do not threaten the environment or human health . Thus sheep slaughter residue which doesnt yet have an adequate and sustainable destination is an excellent source of study . The objective of this study was to investigate the technological properties of collagen extracted from sheep slaughter by products . It was possible to produce and characterize collagens extracted from sheep slaughter by products . The yield of collagen was 18.0 and 12.5 for lamb and sheep by products respectively on a dry basis . Lamb and sheep collagens showed similar FTIR and digestibility spectra and increased solubility at acidic pH value . Higher foaming capacity was found for lamb collagen while the sheep collagen presented higher viscosity . The emulsifying power of the collagens was 59.1 and 69.6m

@highlight The sheep slaughter by products proved to be a viable source for obtaining collagen.
@highlight The yield of collagen was adequate with values of 18.0 and 12.5 on a dry basis.
@highlight The collagens presented bands 
@highlight  and characteristic of collagen type I.
@highlight Obtaining collagen added value and gave the waste a sustainable destination.
@highlight Collagens obtained can be used to replace other collagens or synthetic agents.
