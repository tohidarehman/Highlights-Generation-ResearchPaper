 Existing studies have studied influencing factors of MSW generation behaviour at different spatial levels of organization but always one at a time and not simultaneously . Income is a strong influencing factor affecting MSW generation from the individual to the country level capable of hiding the effects of the others . This study shows that when MSW generation behaviour is holistically analysed across multiple levels of organization hierarchically organized as functional units of MSW generation within a specific study area it is possible to identify influencing factors in addition to income as explanatory variables . Increasing the number of influencing factors of MSW generation makes it possible to create a robust knowledge base for MSW management policies in fast growing urban areas of developing countries improving the information used to select proper policies and plans within their MSW management systems and avoiding overlapping policies causing legal gaps . Betania an urban area of the Panama City district has been chosen as a case study area . The results show that the household income explains 86 of its member MSW generation and the community indigenous population explains 21 of household MSW generation . It is concluded that MSW generation is not linear across levels it has as many degrees of freedom as influencing factors shaping the levels of organization where functional units generating waste exist . Influencing factors appearing at each spatial level affects MSW generation in an interdependent manner in variable degrees of magnitude .

@highlight Sudden changes in MSW generation behaviours are common to developing countries.
@highlight Determined by social practices at multiple hierarchical spatial organization levels.
@highlight Different influencing factors appear at each level and income is mostly the main one.
@highlight Most studies conclude this from analyzing this link one spatial level at a time.
@highlight Simultaneous analysis can reveal influencing factors others than income.
