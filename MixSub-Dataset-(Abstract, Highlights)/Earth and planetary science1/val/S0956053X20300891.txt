 Mycotoxins are metabolites secreted by certain types of moulds and some of them can be harmful to health . The objective of this study was to estimate the level of exposure to airborne aflatoxin B1 ochratoxin A gliotoxin and sterigmatocystin in waste recycling and recovery facilities . An additional goal was to assess the related health risks for workers . Targeted mycotoxins were analysed quantitatively in 94 air samples collected in five sites using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry . The level of exposure to mycotoxin during working day scenarios was compared to benchmark values either health based guidelines when available or the concentration of no toxicological concern when not . Eleven per cent of samples showed quantifiable measurement results . Aflatoxin B1 and sterigmatocystin were quantified at the mechanical separation area in mechanicalbiological treatment facilities and in the materials recovery facility but not in composting plants and composting units in MBT facilities . The levels of exposure were all below 1ngm

@highlight Mycotoxins are toxic metabolites secreted by certain types of fungi.
@highlight Potential exposure in waste management facilities is of health concern for workers.
@highlight We analyzed mycotoxins in the air in composting plants MBT facilities and a MRF.
@highlight Aflatoxin B1 and sterigmatocystin were quantified in 11 of samples.
@highlight The low levels of exposure do not suggest a threat to workers health.
