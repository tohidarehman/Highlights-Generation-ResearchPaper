 Solid recovered fuel has the characteristics of high calorific value and low chlorine and mercury content . The thermal decomposition of SRF collected from a municipal solid waste incineration power plant in Hangzhou was investigated in this study . The study exhibits far reaching significance for the design and commercial operation of SRF pyrolysis facilities and circulating fluidized bed power plants . The pyrolysis behavior of SRF and its sorted components was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis . Five heating rates of 10 15 20 25 and 30Cmin

@highlight Four stages can be distinguished during the pyrolysis process of SRF.
@highlight The pyrolysis performance of SRF becomes much better by increasing heating rate.
@highlight The plastic urges cellulose to decompose at a lower temperature.
@highlight CR method is more applicable for SRF than KAS and FWO methods.
