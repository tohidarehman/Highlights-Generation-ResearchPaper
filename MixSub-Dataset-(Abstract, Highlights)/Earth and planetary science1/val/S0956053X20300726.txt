 The implementation of solid waste selective collection systems is quite difficult in low middle income countries . Lack of awareness infrastructure administrative support and knowledge about recycling are the main barriers for its operation reducing the possibility of successes . This paper introduces the methodological approach for assessing a recyclable waste SC project in a Bolivian public University . The waste fractions generated before and after the action were assessed as well as the opinion and knowledge of the students providing reliable indicators of the improvements and benefits obtained . Results of the waste characterization analysis reported that after one month of implementation of the system about 15kg of plastic and 37.1kg of paper and cardboard were collected about 8wt and 42.9wt of the recyclable waste produced . At the same time the questionnaire survey allows demonstrating that the SC behavior of the students improved considerably from 2018 to 2019 t
