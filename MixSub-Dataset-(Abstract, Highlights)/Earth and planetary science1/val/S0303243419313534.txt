 Satellite derived vegetation indices are widely utilized in yield forecasting models however they can be heavily impacted by atmospheric conditions due to their reliance on visible and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum . Given the importance of soil moisture for crop development the objective of this study was to investigate the use of passive microwave derived estimates of surface SM obtained by the SM Ocean Salinity Mission satellite for forecasting canola yields across the Canadian Prairies within Agriculture and Agri Food Canadas Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster model . Weekly SMOS SM observations were combined with climate variables and normalized difference vegetation index data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer platform and used as an input for forecasting canola yields at the township scale across the Canadian Prairies from 2010 to 2016 . Top predictors were identified and regression models were built using a robust least angle regression and leave one out cross validation scheme . SM was found to provide a better descriptor of canola stress than the more widely utilized NDVI being selected as a predictor in 74.2 of developed ecodistrict models over the 7 year period compared to just 41.2 for NDVI . The difference between model R

@highlight Potential of passive microwave soil moisture in yield forecasting was evaluated.
@highlight Agroclimatic NDVI and SMOS soil moisture indices were included in crop forecast system.
@highlight Passive microwave soil moisture in Week 24 was the top predictor of canola yield.
@highlight SMOS soil moisture provided a better indicator of yield than NDVI.
@highlight Greater model improvements observed in regions with poor climate station coverage.
