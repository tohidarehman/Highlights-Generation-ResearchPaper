 Solid waste materials refer to those municipal or industrial or even domestic wastes that are massively produced during manufacture as well as daily life . A wide variety of solid wastes are generated but only a few of them are employed in pavement structures . To achieve the task papers between 2014 and 2019 from top journals which address waste management waste characterization and economic and environmental assessment were collected at first . Then the scope of solid waste materials was narrowed down based on their applications In the end six most popular solid waste materials were selected for further study and for the review namely recycled concrete aggregates reclaimed asphalt pavement fly ash bottom ash waste rubber and waste plastics . The reason why only these six solid waste materials are selected is that the rest are neither massively produced not can they be directly used in pavement structures . This review article contains structural properties treatments novel researches environmental analysis and economic analysis of each solid waste material . The objective of this review article is to provide future researchers with the latest research findings limitations and improvements in this subject . In conclusion quite a few novel researchers in terms of workmanship construction methodology and treatments are collected for all six materials . Furthermore an increasing number of findings have proven that most solid waste materials have both environmental and economic benefits when applied in field . Future researchers are encouraged to implement researches on solid waste materials in pavement engineering with consideration of both material properties and environmental economic effects .

@highlight Majority of solid waste has no potential threat to environment and human health.
@highlight Utilization of RAP reduces both greenhouse gas emissions and water withdrawals.
@highlight Utilization of rubber reduces greenhouse gas emissions and dust particles.
@highlight Substitution virgin binder with polystyrene can enlarge the life expectancy.
@highlight Environmental and economic effects of waste materials are demanded.
