 The expansion of urban green areas has boosted the accumulation of gardening lignocellulosic residues that could be potentially used to produce platform chemicals like lactic acid . However when using lignocelluloses pretreatment step such as steam explosion is often needed to favour sugar release . Considering that the conversion of glucose from cellulose has been widely addressed this work is focused on the valorisation of the steam exploded gardening liquid fraction rich in hemicellulosic sugars . Since oligomeric sugars are usually solubilized during steam explosion an enzymatic hydrolysis step was required in some cases to increase the monosaccharides content . Although the presence of inhibitors released during pretreatment hindered hydrolysis yields the addition of hemicellulases and the enzyme dosage optimization resulted in 85 89 and 95 of glucose xylose and arabinose release from soluble oligomers respectively .

@highlight Gardening residues are proposed as a new source of sugars to produce lactic acid.
@highlight Hemicellulases addition enhances not only xylose but also glucose hydrolysis.
@highlight Lower formic acid content in the prehydrolysates implied higher hydrolysis yields.
@highlight Organic acids hampered total xylose consumption when the pH was not controlled.
@highlight Hydrolysate fermentation with NaOH addition yielded 95 of the maximum lactic acid.
