 Pharmaceutical blister packages usually comprise of aluminium and plastic layers . Due to their multi material structure the discarded packages are typically landfilled although when separated both metallic and polymeric fractions would be recyclable . In the present study separation of aluminium and polymeric layers of waste pharmaceutical blisters was conducted by exploitation of deep eutectic solvent and pure lactic acid both of which are considered green solvents . The separation of aluminium and plastic was investigated at different temperatures solvent concentrations solid liquid ratios and agitation speeds .

@highlight Waste pharmaceutical blisters contain recyclable metal and non metal fractions.
@highlight Separation of metals and non metals was conducted with lactic acid and DES.
@highlight Temperature was the most significant factor on the separation time.
@highlight Presence of water enhances dissolution of aluminium in used solvents.
@highlight Complete separation was accomplished in all studied circumstances.
