 There is an increasing need for landfill leachate pretreatment prior to discharge to wastewater treatment plants due to increasingly stringent sewer discharge limits . Lab scale tests have shown that the anaerobic biological processes can effectively remove chemical oxygen demand and dissolved organic carbon from landfill leachate . Our work expands the knowledge in anaerobic leachate pretreatment by systematically studying the conversion of carbon and nitrogen species particularly their recalcitrant fractions in a submerged anaerobic biofilm reactor using real world leachate from a typical young municipal solid waste landfill . After reaching steady state the reactor removed 41.7 of the fulvic acids

@highlight The anaerobic bioreactor removed 42 of fulvic acids.
@highlight The anaerobic bioreactor removed 98 of recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen.
@highlight The removed nitrogen correlated to compounds with low O C and or N C ratios.
@highlight The removed carbon correlated to compounds with low O C and or H C ratios.
