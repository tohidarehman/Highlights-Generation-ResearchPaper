 Multitemporal land cover classification over urban areas is challenging especially when using heterogeneous data sources with variable quality attributes . A prominent challenge is that classes with similar spectral signatures tend to be confused with one another . In this paper we evaluate the efficacy of image point cloud data combined with suitable Bayesian analysis based time series rectification techniques to improve the classification accuracy in a multitemporal context . The proposed method uses hidden Markov models to rectify land covers that are initially classified by a random forest algorithm . This land cover classification method is tested using time series of remote sensing data from a heterogeneous and rapidly changing urban landscape observed from 2006 to 2014 . The data consisted of aerial images Landsat data and airborne laser scanning data . The results of the study demonstrate that the addition of three dimensional image point cloud data derived from aerial stereo images as predictor variables improved overall classification accuracy around three percentage points . Additionally HMM based post processing reduces significantly the number of spurious year to year changes . Using a set of 240 validation points we estimated that this step improved overall classification accuracy by around 3.0 percentage points and up to 6 to 10 percentage points for some classes . The overall accuracy of the final product was 91 . Our analysis shows that around 1.9 of the area around Kuopio city representing a total area of approximately 0.61km
