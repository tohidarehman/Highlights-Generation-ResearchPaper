 In developing countries organic waste is commonly dumped in untreated landfills . Brazil has around 3 000 landfills distributed in 1 600 cities . The Brazilian government instituted the National Solid Waste Policy which set the goal of ending the dumping grounds in 2014 . However it was not accomplished . Municipal governments do not have the resources to fund the existing treatment technologies . Thus there is an urgent need to propose low cost alternatives to solve this problem . This work proposes a low cost Product Service System solution that enables the proper treatment of organic waste using the current municipal budget based on the renting of household biodigesters . It was outlined from a model built on various proposals for the PSS design published between 2011 and 2018 . A feasibility simulation of the proposal conducted for the scenario of the Brazilian city of Porto Amazonas has demonstrated that by adopting the proposal the administration could comply with the PNRS and save part of its actual budget . It also showed 75 of probability of financial viability for the PSS provider in a scenario of reduction of up to 20 in the current municipal costs for organic waste collection and transportation and up to 40 off in cooking gas costs for the equipment hosting households . The proposal is a potential solution for the Brazilian municipalities with more favorable scenarios to comply with the PNRS as well as other countries municipalities with budget constraints to eliminate their dumps .
