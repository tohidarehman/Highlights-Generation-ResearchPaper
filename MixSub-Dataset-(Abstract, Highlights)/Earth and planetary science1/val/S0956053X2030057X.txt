 Solid waste management is a challenge in developing countries . The Structural dump in Brasilia Brazil was the largest Latin American open air dump until its closure in 2018 . Thus this study sought to investigate the prevalence of self reported dengue Zika and Chikungunya arbovirus infections in waste pickers who worked at the dumpsite and assess its association with the sanitary conditions in their residences and workplaces . This research used a mixed methods study using a questionnaire for the quantitative method and semi structured interviews for the qualitative portion . A cross sectional observational epidemiological study along with a phenomenological study were carried out to characterize socio environmental occupational and health related aspects to vector borne diseases in Structural dumpsite in Brazil . Of the 1 025 respondents 301 reported to have gotten sick from dengue Zika or chikungunya fevers . We found significant associations between place of residence of waste pickers and the work conditions use of personal protective equipment and weekly workload and occurrence of vector borne disease . Results were confirmed by qualitative data and geo referencing in relation to location of their homes and proximity to the dumpsite as well as through the vulnerability due to their working conditions . This research confirms that waste pickers are highly susceptible to vector borne diseases this situation that needs to be immediately addressed by interdisciplinary and intersectoral approaches in waste management and public health . This information confirms vulnerability of waste pickers to diseases transmitted by
