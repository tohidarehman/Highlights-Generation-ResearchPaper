 In the context of waste upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate by pyrolysis this study presents three on line mass spectrometric techniques with soft ionization for monitoring the emitted decomposition products and their thermal dependent evolution profiles . Pyrolysis experiments were performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 5C min from 30C to 600C . Single photon ionization and resonance enhanced multiple photon ionization were used with time of flight mass spectrometry for evolved gas analysis . Additionally the chemical signature of the pyrolysis products was investigated by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization ultra high resolution Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry which enables assignment of molecular sum formulas . Despite the soft ionization by SPI the fragmentation of some compounds with the loss of the fragment is observed . The major compounds were acetaldehyde
