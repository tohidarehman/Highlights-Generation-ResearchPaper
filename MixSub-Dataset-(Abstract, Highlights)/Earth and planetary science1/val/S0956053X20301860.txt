 Levoglucosan is served as a significant versatile product to generate high value added chemicals and pharmaceutical additives . Levoglucosan was predominately produced from pyrolysate of cellulose . However the direct fast pyrolysis of waste biomass produces a small quantity of levoglucosan in comparison with the theoretical value of cellulose . This study explored Fenton pretreatment as a possible route to enhance levoglucosan yield during the fast pyrolysis of the waste corncob . The experimental results showed that different Fenton pretreated conditions and pyrolytic temperatures played vital roles in the formation of levoglucosan . The levoglucosan yield from fast pyrolysis at 500C of corncob pretreated by Fenton reaction of 14mL g H

@highlight The Fenton pretreatment of waste biomass prior to fast pyrolysis was investigated.
@highlight Fenton pretreated biomass obtained higher levoglucosan yield than raw biomass.
@highlight Fenton pretreated biomass can obtain levoglucosan at low pyrolytic temperature.
@highlight Fenton pretreatment removed effectively alkali and alkaline earth metals.
