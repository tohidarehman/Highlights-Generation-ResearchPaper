 The combination of increased maritime transportation and the sensitivity of the Baltic Sea makes it necessary to establish efficient eco friendly and profitable ship generated waste management strategies . This study aims to identify best management practices for ship generated nutrient rich organic wastes i.e . food waste and sewage on the Baltic Sea . Ship generated waste quantities and characteristics maritime waste regulations and disposal methods are reviewed and discussed according to the available literature for the Ports of Helsinki Stockholm Tallinn and Copenhagen Malm which are the most important and busiest ports on the Baltic Sea . Sorting onboard and separation of food waste from other waste sources such as sewage and grey water is a suitable solution that facilitates further treatment . However this procedure demands special facilities and sufficient storage space . Aforementioned food waste can be delivered to port reception facilities and used to produce biogas at land . However currently only food waste from ships operating in the EU may be used as input for biogas production not international food waste . Grinding of food waste and discharge into the sea is still common practice . In addition shipping companies can choose buffet type restaurants in order to reduce food waste generation . Grey wastewater is generally discharged into the sea whereas sewage needs to be treated on board before discharge or delivered to PRFs for treatment . New MARPOL regulations for passenger ships on the Baltic Sea require advanced treatment of pollutant nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus before sewage discharge in order to combat eutrophication of this sensitive area .

@highlight Ship generated food waste and sewage cause eutrophication of the Baltic Sea.
@highlight Best management practices for handling these waste sources have been identified.
@highlight Onboard waste sorting can facilitate future treatment.
@highlight Domestic ship generated food waste can be valorized at land through biomethanation.
@highlight Advanced sewage treatment including nutrient removal is obliged on the Baltic Sea.
