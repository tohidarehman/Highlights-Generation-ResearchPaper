 The fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation is a crucial variable for assessing global carbon balances and currently there is an urgent need for reference data to validate satellite derived fAPAR products . However it is well known that fAPAR ground measurements are associated with considerable uncertainties . Generally fAPAR measurements can be carried out with two three and four flux approaches depending on the number of flux terms measured . Currently not much is known about the number of flux terms needed to satisfactorily reduce systematic errors . This study investigates the accuracy of different fAPAR estimates based on permanent 10 min PAR measurements using Wireless Sensor Networks at three forest sites located in Central Europe North America and Central America . All fAPAR estimates reflect the seasonal course of fAPAR . The highest average biases of different fAPAR estimates account to 0.02 at the temperate 0.08 at the boreal and 0.05 at the tropical site respectively thereby generally fulfilling the uncertainty threshold of a maximum of 10 or 0.05 fAPAR units set by the Global Climate Observing System . During high wind speed conditions at the boreal site the bias of the two flux fAPAR estimate exceeded the 0.05 uncertainty threshold . Three flux fAPAR estimates were not found to be advantageous especially at the tropical site . Our findings are beneficial for the development of sampling protocols that are needed to validate global satellite derived fAPAR products .
