 With the focus of industries shifting towards sustainable processing methods and the use of sustainable raw materials reuse and recycling of polyester have gained a lot of momentum . In spite of considerable efforts the utilization of polyester fiber waste has not yet found a strong foundation in textile processing . In this paper waste polyester fibers obtained during the melt spinning process has been utilized by first dissolving it in an m cresol solvent and later by chemical route polyester is regenerated on cotton leading to the preparation of cotton based composite fabric . The presence of polyester was confirmed using XRD FTIR and percent add on and SEM . Percent add on of 9.7 along with the doubling of tensile strength and enhanced thermal stability was observed . The results can make a way as one of the possibilities of utilizing polyester fiber waste .

@highlight A PET cotton blend fabric was prepared using chemical recycling method.
@highlight The proposed composite would act as a substitute for a commercially available PET.
@highlight The mechanical properties of this fabric were almost doubled.
@highlight Utilizing waste fiber is expected to change the conventional manufacturing process.
