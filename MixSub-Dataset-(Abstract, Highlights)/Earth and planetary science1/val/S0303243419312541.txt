 Remote sensing technology is important for soil organic matter estimation but existing studies have mainly relied on a single data source . This limitation makes it difficult to simultaneously ensure high spatial resolution high spectral accuracy and refined temporal granularity simultaneously which can not meet the requirements of the spatiotemporal dynamics representation . This study aimed to introduce a new remote sensing image source into SOM modeling and spatiotemporal estimation generated by fusing together Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 remote sensing images that have a 5 day revisit cycle 10m spatial resolution and 21 different bands in blue green red and NIR spectral ranges . According to the image fusion process a total of 52 available images were acquired between November 2016 and December 2018 in Donghai County China . The fused images were used for SOM estimation model associated with 107 field samples . The results indicated that first the optimal model consisted of the band reflectivity and RVI which were derived from the fused images and the R

@highlight The refined spatiotemporal features of SOM were estimated according to remote sensing fusion.
@highlight The estimation accuracies of SOM are influenced by actual SOM contents.
@highlight The SOM content demonstrated similar spatial features in different temporal scales.
