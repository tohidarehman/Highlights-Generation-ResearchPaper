 The treatment disposal and resource recovery of sewage sludge is a major bottleneck for the water and environmental remediation efforts in China . In this paper sixteen sludge treatment plants using anaerobic digestion and aerobic composting as stabilization procedures were investigated and analysed . The organic degradation rates varied from 0.5 to 80.2 of different plants showing the close relationship with raw sludge property and treatment process . The increment rate of humic like substances ranged from 19 to 81 in different cases . It has been aware of that stabilization procedures coupled the degradation of simple organics with the synthesis of complex organics . Therefore an alternative methodology considering the content of humic like substances and the fluorescence complexity index in the end products was proposed to evaluate the stabilization level . Humic like substances indicate the ecological value of the end products . Fluorescence complexity index combining the reduction of protein like substances with the increment of humic like substances can predict the humification degree . The new criterion can be the supplementary of the current ones .
