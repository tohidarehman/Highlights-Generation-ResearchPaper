 Algal blooms and the resulting deterioration of water quality have threatened the environmental health of inland lakes . This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea the largest inland water body in California . An innovative gypsum bloom index was proposed to detect gypsum blooms based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Terra data for three bands during 20002018 . Discoloration was observed in the gypsum bloom infested waters mapped using the hue saturation and value color model . We found that the GI is able to effectively map gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea with a relatively high accuracy the largest gypsum bloom area was observed in summer with notable gypsum blooms lasting more than 40 days in 2003 2005 2006 2016 and 2018 the gypsum bloom infested waters shifted from the center to the southeastern shore of the lake during 20032018 and the frequency of gypsum blooms significantly increased since 2008 . Meanwhile the temporal and spatial differences between the northwestern and southeastern lake increased over the observation period and discoloration occurred in the gypsum bloom infested waters and lasted for 14 days on average longer periods of discoloration occurred d in 2002 2016 and 2018 . The reconstruction of gypsum bloom dynamics in the Salton Sea provides valuable information for the practical management and restoration of the Salton Sea .

@highlight An innovative gypsum bloom index GI was proposed to detect gypsum blooms based on MODIS data.
@highlight The GI index was applied to Salton Sea to extract gypsum blooms during 20002018.
@highlight The gypsum bloom infested waters have shifted and the frequency of the gypsum blooms significantly increased since 2008.
