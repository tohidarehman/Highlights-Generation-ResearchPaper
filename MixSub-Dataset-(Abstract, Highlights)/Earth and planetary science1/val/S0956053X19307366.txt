 The establishment of recycling network is critical to improve municipal solid waste management . However how to determine the best locations for the recycling stations and recycling centers remains to be solved . Under such a circumstance this study aims to forecast the MSW generation and develop a cost based location optimization model using p median method so that the optimal scale and location of recycling centers can be identified . Shanghai with an ambitious plan for promoting MSW recycling at the city level was selected as a case study city . Results show that Shanghais MSW generation rate will be about 3 from 2017 to 2020 . Regional distribution analysis shows that the downtown areas have higher intensity for MSW generation due to high population density and consumption level . Fourteen regional recycling centers were identified to be the optimal places for establishing recycling centers . The achievement of this scenario can lead to the lowest total cost of 144 million Chinese Yuan . Moreover the optimal results may change if unit transportation cost and unit scale cost are changed . For instance the optimal numbers of recycling centers will increase with the increase of unit transportation cost or decrease of unit scale cost . Finally model limitations and policy recommendations are raised by considering the local realities .

@highlight Location optimization model of recyclable MSW recycling center RRC was developed.
@highlight The model was based on p median method and total cost minimization.
@highlight The optimal number of RRCs for case of Shanghai China was proved to be 14.
@highlight Optimized RRCs were located in rural area but surrounded populated urban area.
@highlight Optimal RRCs will change with unit transportation cost and unit scale cost.
