 This paper presented a new method of preparing porous glass ceramics by high temperature pore forming using coal fly ash and asbestos tailings as raw materials . The effects of the content of asbestos tailings and sintering temperature on the phase composition microstructure and properties of the porous glass ceramics had been systematically discussed furthermore the pore formation mechanism was also expounded . Compared with T0 porous glass ceramics from T1 T2 and T3 experienced more violent self expansion during the sintering process due to the addition of asbestos tailings . The porosity of porous glass ceramics from T3 was 51 the bulk density was 1.42g cm

@highlight A comprehensive utilization method of coal fly ash and asbestos tailings is proposed.
@highlight No pore forming agent was added when preparing porous glass ceramics.
@highlight The formation of pores is mainly due to the phenomenon of self expansion.
@highlight The material is expected to be used as a thermal insulation construction material.
