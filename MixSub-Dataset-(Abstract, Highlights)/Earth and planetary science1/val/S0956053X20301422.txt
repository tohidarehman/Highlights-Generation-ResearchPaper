 Volatile organic compounds are the main precursors of tropospheric ozone and secondary aerosol generation posing a threat to human health and affecting the environmental climate . A large quantity of VOCs can be produced in the initial decomposition stage of municipal solid waste . In this study the atmosphere in an MSW transfer station was monitored for one year . The emission characteristics of VOCs in different seasons and working hours were analyzed and the ozone formation potential of VOCs was calculated through the maximum incremental reaction method and health risks posed by the VOCs in the MSW transfer station were assessed . The results showed that the highest concentration of VOCs appeared in spring and summer accounting for 70.6 and 26.6 of total VOCs in peak working periods respectively . Oxygenated compounds and terpenes contributed most to ozone formation accounting for 41.0 and 50.6 of total ozone formation respectively . The carcinogenic risks were above the safe threshold labeled probable risks . Tetrachloroethylene and 1 2 dichloroethane were the main contributors to carcinogenic risks . The mean non carcinogenic risks were within the safe threshold in the MSW transfer station . From the perspective of protecting human health and ecological environmental safety VOC control needs to be further strengthened in the transfer station .

@highlight Oxygenated compounds and terpenes were dominant in the MSW transfer station.
@highlight Oxygenated compounds and terpenes were the most photochemically active VOCs.
@highlight No non carcinogenic risks appeared in the MSW transfer station.
@highlight Considerable carcinogenic risks were identified in the MSW transfer station.
