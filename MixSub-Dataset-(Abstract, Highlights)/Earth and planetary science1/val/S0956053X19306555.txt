 Preparation for reuse is a fundamental waste management practice that is second only to prevention in the waste hierarchy . The paper building on advertising literature investigates how to leverage the pro social nature of this option for giving products that have become waste a second life . To examine how advertising strategies based on emotional functional or combined stimuli can be used to increase intention to buy these items we carried out an experiment on 507 actual visitors a PfR items shop run by a social cooperative in Northern Italy . We found that depending on consumers social involvement both emotional and functional stimuli based on the social impact of preparation for reuse tend to outperform functional stimuli and have a positive impact on brand attitudes by shaping attitudes to advertisements . Purchasing behaviour has a positive impact on attitudes toward the PfR organization and moderates the effect of emotional and combines stimuli on attitudes toward the advertisement . Since emotional stimuli can be freely used by both legitimated and opportunistic companies the former should seek to preserve their value proposition by making it easier for consumers to recognise actually trustworthy organizations . This is possible combining the use of advertisements with the development of solid customer relationships . To this end awareness campaigns closer relationships with stakeholders and third party verifiable standards and certifications should be considered to reduce the risk of social washing in the current second hand market context .
