 This research investigated the roles of zero valent iron in a two stage food waste digestion process . ZVI was added separately to hydrolytic acidogenic and methanogenic stages to understand its impacts on FW hydrolysis acidification methanogenesis and bioenergy recovery efficiency . Results showed that ZVI effectively enhanced the overall performance of digestion as compared with the controls without ZVI . Supplementing with ZVI could facilitate the HA process along with faster hydrogen generation . In addition ZVI shortened the lag phase of MG stage by 42.4357.23 and raised the maximum methane production rate and yield by 33.9938.20 and 1113 respectively compared with the controls . Supplementing ZVI to the HA stage could simultaneously raise the bioenergy recovery efficiency of the HA and MG stages by 71.92 and 96.96 respectively . Further studies demonstrated that iron corrosion contributed little to hydrogen and methane production . The enrichment of syntrophic bacteria
