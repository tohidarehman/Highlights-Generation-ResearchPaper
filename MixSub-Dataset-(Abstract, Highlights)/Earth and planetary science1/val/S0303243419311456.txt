 Classification of very high resolution imagery is challenging due to the difficulty in mining complex spatial and spectral patterns from rich image details . Various object based Convolutional Neural Networks for VHRI classification have been proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the redundant pixel wise CNNs owing to their low computational cost and fine contour preserving . However classification performance of OCNN is still limited by geometric distortions insufficient feature representation and lack of contextual guidance . In this paper an innovative multi level context guided classification method with the OCNN is proposed . A feature fusing OCNN including the object contour preserving mask strategy with the supplement of object deformation coefficient is developed for accurate object discrimination by learning simultaneously high level features from independent spectral patterns geometric characteristics and object level contextual information . Then pixel level contextual guidance is used to further improve the per object classification results . The MLCG OCNN method is intentionally tested on two validated small image datasets with limited training samples to assess the performance in applications of land cover classification where a trade off between time consumption of sample training and overall accuracy needs to be found as it is very common in the practice . Compared with traditional benchmark methods including the patch based per pixel CNN the patch based per object CNN the pixel wise CNN with object segmentation refinement semantic segmentation U Net and DeepLabV3 MLCG OCNN method achieves remarkable classification performance . Compared with the state of the art architecture DeepLabV3 the MLCG OCNN method demonstrates high computational efficiency for VHRI classification .
