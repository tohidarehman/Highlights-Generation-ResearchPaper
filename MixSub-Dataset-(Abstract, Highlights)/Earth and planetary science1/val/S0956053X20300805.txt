 VOCs are the major harmful pollutants released from MSW landfills which are toxicity to human health . In order to in situ biodegradation of VOCs released from landfill two novel laboratory scale biocovers including waste char obtained from MSW pyrolysis and sewage sludge modified the WC are used to degradate VOCs . The removal performances of VOCs as well as the bacterial community in the WC and SWC are investigated in a simulated landfill systems with the contrast experiment of a landfill cover soil for 60days . Meanwhile the adsorption biodegradation of VOCs model compounds over the LCS WC and SWC are also tested in fixed bed adsorption reactor and in situ FTIR . The VOCs removal efficiencies by the SWC are maintained above 85 for a long term much higher than that of the LCS and WC . The higher removal efficiencies and long term stability for VOCs degradation in SWC are attributed to a strongly positive synergistic between adsorption and biodegradation that the gaseous VOCs released from MSW is effectively adsorbed by the SWC due to its higher VOCs adsorption capacity and then the adsorbed VOCs is converted into CO

@highlight The removal efficiencies of VOCs by the SWC range from 88.80 to 93.68 .
@highlight The VOCs adsorption capacities follow the order of LCS SWC WC.
@highlight The VOCs biodegradation capacities follow the order of LCS WC SWC.
@highlight The population of bacterial community follow the order of LCS WC SWC.
@highlight A synergistic between adsorption and biodegradation in the SWC exist.
