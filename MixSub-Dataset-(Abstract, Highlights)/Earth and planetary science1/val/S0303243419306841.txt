 Three dimensional surface deformation is resolved using deformations obtained from multiple line of sight differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar . However the random model is susceptible to both accidental errors and system errors . To solve this problem we present a weight determining method based on high precision global positioning system observations . Specifically the precision of multi LOS D InSAR deformation observations is evaluated based on high precision GPS deformation observations from the same period . Then by considering the influence of system errors and accidental errors on the deformation of a pixel observed by multi LOS D InSAR a combined fitting model associated with the positions and elevations of a pixel is built . Finally the precision of deformations from multi LOS D InSAR is evaluated pixel by pixel by using the built model . As a result the weights of observations in the model for resolving three dimensional surface deformation using multi LOS D InSAR can be determined . We verify the feasibility and precision of the weight determining method through a simulation experiment and a real data experiment respectively . The verification results show that the proposed weight determining method based on high precision GPS observations provides higher reliability for the resolved three dimensional surface deformation .
