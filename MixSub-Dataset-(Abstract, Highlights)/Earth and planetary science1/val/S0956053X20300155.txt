 The generation of landfill leachate nanofiltration concentrate has been a dilemma for leachate treatment plants because it contains large amounts of refractory organics with low molecular weight as well as heavy metals and is difficult to handle . The coagulation removal of LMWOs is a significant challenge as is the removal of HMs bonded to LMWOs . In this study coagulation through the dosing of FeCl

@highlight LMWOs were efficiently removed by specialistic adsorption of Fe

@highlight Humification played an important role on the coagulation removal of LMWOs.
@highlight LMWOs dissociated due to acid effect and inner sphere complexes.
@highlight Acid effect and inner sphere complexes decreased the coagulation removal of LMWOs.
@highlight Partition of LMWO components showed various influences on heavy metals removal.
