 The combustion of dry sewage sludge particles in a bubbling fluidized bed was studied in detail analyzing the composition of the exhaust gases by means of a FTIR equipment . The operating conditions of the fluidized bed i.e . the bed temperature and mass flow rate of fluidizing air were varied to quantify their effect on the exhaust gas composition . The bed material was also varied using sepiolite silica sand and braunite particles to evaluate the effect of different bed densities on the pollutant emissions . The results obtained for the combustion of sewage sludge particles in the different fluidized beds tested were compared to combustion tests run for the same operating conditions and bed materials using

@highlight Sewage sludge and
@highlight combustion in bubbling fluidized beds is studied.
@highlight Pollutant emissions derived from combustion are determined by FTIR spectrometer.
@highlight CO emissions decrease substantially when increasing gas velocity and temperature.
@highlight Higher bed density improves combustion efficiency at low gas velocity and temperature.
@highlight At higher gas velocities and temperatures low density beds attain higher efficiency.
