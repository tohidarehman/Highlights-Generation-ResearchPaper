 While driving the regional economy industrial parks also pose great threats to natural environment due to large quantities of resource consumption and intensive pollutants emissions . Eco industrial development including cleaner production bioproducts or waste interchange and infrastructure sharing is key to improving the parks environmental quality and sustainability . However how to measure the performance of eco industrial development is an essential and hard work since the material and energy flows are complex and can not be compared in various units . The water and non renewable resources which are very vital materials to sustain industrial activities in the industrial parks were rarely considered in the previous traditional ecological footprint analysis . Therefore our research depicts a real picture of all the resources including water and non renewable resources to illustrate the actual environmental impact of a national high technology industrial development zone Jiangyin high technology Park using energy based ecological footprint method . Results show that the emergy ecological footprint deficit and emergy ecological footprint intensity of the study park decreased by 16.75 and 16.74 due to the implementation of eco industrial development . In detail minerals made the largest reduction 2.00E 2ha capita followed by fossil fuels with a reduction of 1.01E 2ha capita and the resources from cropland and pasture did not make a contribution in reducing emergy ecological footprint . Policy implications such as further replenishing and improving the ecological industry chains are proposed based on this survey . This study provides a basis to improve the environmental management and performance of industrial parks .

@highlight A hybrid indicator was used to assess environmental impact of industrial park.
@highlight Water and metals were considered compared to traditional ecological footprint study.
@highlight Waste treatment and recycling was considered in the environmental assessment.
@highlight Emergy ecological footprint fell by 3.52E 7ha due to eco industrial development.
@highlight Emergy ecological deficit decreased by 16.75
