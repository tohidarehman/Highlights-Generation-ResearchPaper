 This work studied the methane gas production of the Aura landfill the official destination of all Municipal Solid Waste of the Metropolitan Region of Belem operational until 2015 . In 2007 the Aura Landfill was equipped with a landfill gas burning system in a CDM UNFCCC project with reported measured volumes of burned methane gas . These volumes were used to retrieve the methane generation potential

@highlight In a large landfill in the Amazon retrieved methane generation rate was 0.25 year.
@highlight This rate is 47 larger than suggested by the IPCC and 3 times larger than LandGEMs.
@highlight 48 of the total emission had happened before implementing the gas burning system.
@highlight 81 of the total methane emission have occured up to the landfills closing date.
@highlight A total of 9.3 Tg of CO2eq may be released into the atmosphere during its lifetime.
