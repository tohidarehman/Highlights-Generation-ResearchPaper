 The configuration of the reactor influences the digestion process and thus the product yields other factors such as the rate of biogas production or biogas loss also affect the process specifically with high solid configuration . With these in mind the ORganic WAste REsearch anaerobic digestion sub model was modified to be able to study solid state anaerobic digestion . The simulation results from the updated model agreed with the operational data with respect to methane yield digestate yield and energy turnover . The model was found to be sensitive to changes in feedstock composition but to a lesser extent to changes in process temperature and retention time . By applying the model on several cases of liquid anaerobic digestion it was noticed that L AD at mesophilic condition with 25 retention days seemed to be superior to other cases of L AD with regard to energy turnover . However even if similar methane production were observed for L AD and SS AD the model suggested higher energy turnover for the case of SS AD at thermophilic condition being 10 more in average in comparison with cases of L AD .

@highlight ORWARE model was enabled to simulate SS AD with plug flow reactor.
@highlight Model predicted methane digestate yield energy turnover for a full scale SS AD.
@highlight L AD and SS AD at different temperatures had similar methane yield.
@highlight Thermophilic SS AD had higher energy turnover than mesophilic L AD.
