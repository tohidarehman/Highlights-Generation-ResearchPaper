 In this study we investigate the applicability of the Induced Polarization imaging method to discriminate between biogeochemically active and inactive areas of a landfill . The elevated amount of degradable organic carbon in landfills results in the development of biogeochemical hot spots associated with high rates of microbial activity and the generation of landfill gas and leachate as metabolic products . Our results demonstrate that the electrical conductivity is mainly sensitive to the increase in the fluid conductivity associated to leachate production and migration . Whereas images of the polarization effect expressed in terms of the imaginary component
