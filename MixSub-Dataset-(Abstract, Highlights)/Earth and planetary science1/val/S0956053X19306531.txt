 Waste collection is associated with various health symptoms . The aims of this study were to obtain knowledge about exposure to bacteria fungi and endotoxin during waste collection and to study whether it is possible to reduce the exposures and the total inflammatory potential of those exposures through simple interventions . The study was performed with an initial baseline exposure assessment a second assessment with intervention workers only and a third with intervention and reference workers . Motivating workers to reduce exposure through simple interventions improved hand and truck cab hygiene but only slightly reduced personal exposure to airborne bioaerosols . Exposure can be reduced by only using trucks with high loading height .

@highlight Exposure to bioaerosols was highest during collection of household waste.
@highlight Implementation of truck cab hygiene reduced concentrations of fungi.
@highlight Hand hygiene was improved by making hand sanitizer available.
@highlight Implementation of interventions reduced the inflammatory potential of exposures.
@highlight Low waste loading height caused the highest exposure to bioaerosols.
