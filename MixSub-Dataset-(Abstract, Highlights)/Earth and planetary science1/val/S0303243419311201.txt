 Climate oscillation modes can shape weather across the globe due to atmospheric teleconnections . We built on the findings of a recent study to assess whether the impacts of teleconnections are detectable and significant in the early season dynamics of highland pastures across five rayons in Kyrgyzstan . Specifically since land surface phenology has already shown to be influenced by snow cover seasonality and terrain we investigated here how much more explanatory and predictive power information about climatic oscillation modes might add to explain variation in LSP . We focused on seasonal values of five climate oscillation indices that influence vegetation dynamics in Central Asia . We characterized the phenology in highland pastures with metrics derived from LSP modeling using Landsat NDVI time series together with MODIS land surface temperature data Peak Height the maximum modeled NDVI and Thermal Time to Peak the quantity of accumulated growing degree days based on LST required to reach PH . Next we calculated two metrics of snow cover seasonality from MODIS snow cover composites last date of snow and the number of snow covered dates . For terrain features we derived elevation slope and TRASP index as linearization of aspect . First we used Spearmans rank correlation to assess the geographical differentiation of land surface phenology metrics responses to environmental variables . PH showed weak correlations with TTP and moderate relationships with LDoS and SCD only in one northeastern rayon . Slope was weakly related to PH while TRASP showed a consistent moderate negative correlation with PH . A significant but weak negative correlation was found between PH and SCAND JJA and a significant weak positive correlation with MEI MAM . TTP showed consistently strong negative relationships with LDoS SCD and elevation . Very weak positive correlations with TTP were found for EAWR DJF AMO DJF and MEI DJF in western rayons only . Second we used Partial Least Squares regression to investigate the role of oscillation modes altogether . PLS modelling of TTP showed that thermal time accumulation could be explained mostly by elevation and snow cover metrics leading to reduced models explaining 55 to 70 of observed variation in TTP . Variable selection indicated that NAO JJA AMO JJA and SCAND MAM had significant relationships with TTP but their input of predictive power was neglible . PLS models were able to explain up to 29 of variability in PH . SCAND JJA and MEI MAM were shown to be significant predictors but adding them into models did not influence modeling performance . We concluded the impacts of climate oscillation anomalies were not detectable or significant in mountain pastures using LSP metrics at fine spatial resolution . Rather at a 30m resolution the indirect effects of seasonal climatic oscillations are overridden by terrain influences and snow cover timing . Whether climate oscillation mode indices can provide some new and useful information about growing season conditions remains a provocative question particularly in light of the multiple environmental challenges facing the agropastoralism livelihood in montane Central Asia .

@highlight Explored the influence of five climate oscillation modes on land surface phenology LSP .
@highlight Previous studies found influence of modes on precipitation and temperature in Central Asia.
@highlight At 30m resolution we found generally negligible influence of modes in highland pastures.
@highlight Snow cover seasonality and terrain factors more tightly linked to LSP.
@highlight Study demonstrates how local factors can override influence of teleconnections.
