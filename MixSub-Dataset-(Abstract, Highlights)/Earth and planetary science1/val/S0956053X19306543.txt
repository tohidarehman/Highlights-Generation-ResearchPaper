 Recycling solid waste not only produces environmental and health benefits but also generates economic benefit . This paper empirically evaluates the employment impact of Florida county recycling programs from 2000 through 2011 applying a fixed effects regression model . The results indicate that a one percentage point increase of county recycling rate leads to a 0.4 job growth in overall solid waste and recycling industry . However the impact of recycling programs on green jobs are not uniform across the recycling subsectors the effect is concentrated in the recycling processing sector while the solid waste collection sector and scrap materials businesses are unlikely to be influenced by countys recycling performance .
