 Wind power is a key renewable electricity source for Europe that is estimated to further develop significantly by 2050 . However the first generation of wind turbines is reaching their End of Life and the disposal of their blades is becoming a crucial waste management problem . Wind turbine blades consist primarily of reinforced composites and currently there is a lack of a sustainable solution to recycle them .

@highlight Wind turbine blade waste material availability forecasted for Europe until 2050.
@highlight Onshore wind blade material will be 76 of the total in 2050.
@highlight Germany leads the onshore blade material availability and the UK the offshore.
@highlight Local hotspots of material availability identified in Europe at NUTS 2 level.
@highlight Fluctuations of the material availability are expected at the country level.
