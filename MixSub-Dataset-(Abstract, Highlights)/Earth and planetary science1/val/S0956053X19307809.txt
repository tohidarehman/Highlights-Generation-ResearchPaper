 Coal ash can potentially be utilized as partial replacement for cement in concrete and mortar formulations . The use of coal ash can lessen the cost and energy production and reduce the impact on the environment . At present the annual coal ash generation amounts to 2.78 Mt and may reach to 13.02 Mt by 2035 in the Philippines . If coal ash is utilized as clinker replacement in the production of cement at a clinker to cement ratio of 0.7 GHG emissions can potentially be reduced to at least 1.26 Mt CO

@highlight Coal fired plants contribute about 52.1 to power generation in the Philippines.
@highlight A CCR of 0.7 will have at least 9.11 Mt CO
@highlight potential CO
@highlight reduction by 2035.
@highlight Critical ash transport distance ranges from 2841 to 3244km land and 5227km sea .
@highlight Minimum cost of ash 3.24 bag is dependent primarily on land transportation cost.
@highlight Coal ash as cement replacement will reduce GHG emissions and cement material costs.
