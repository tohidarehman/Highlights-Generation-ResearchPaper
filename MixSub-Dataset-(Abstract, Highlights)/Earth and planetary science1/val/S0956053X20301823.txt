 The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of pretreating macroalgal residue from agar agar extraction and its co digestion with sewage sludge on methane production and the agronomic quality of the digestates produced . First different pretreatments were assessed on BMP tests . Among milling technologies used knife milling with a 4mm screen improved methane production by 25 . The MAR was then knife milled before alkaline acid and thermal pretreatment . KOH pretreatment led to the highest methane improvement . It was applied to semi continuous anaerobic digestion and methane production achieved 237 Nml gVS which was 20 higher than the control . In comparison to MAR mono digestion co digestion with thickened activated sludge produced less methane but reduced H

@highlight Valorization of macroalgal residues by anaerobic digestion.
@highlight Knife milling and alkaline pretreatment enhanced methane production.
@highlight In semi continuous reactors alkaline pretreatment enhanced methane by 20 .
@highlight Digestates did not exhibit phytotoxicity.
@highlight Digestate from codigestion with sludge led to the highest tomato plant growth.
