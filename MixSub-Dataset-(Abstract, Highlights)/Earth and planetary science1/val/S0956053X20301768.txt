 Insulating strategies are indispensable for laboratory scale composting reactors however current insulation methods interfere with the aerobic fermentation behaviors related to composting . To address this issue a centre oriented real time temperature compensation strategy was designed in this study . Five 9 L reactors with different insulation strategies were used for the co composting of dewatered sludge and

@highlight Insulating strategy notably influenced the laboratory scale composting behaviors.
@highlight A centre oriented real time temperature compensation was applied in the composting.
@highlight Five composting reactors with different insulating strategies were compared.
@highlight Co composting of sludge and wetland plants is meaningful for the running of WWTP.
