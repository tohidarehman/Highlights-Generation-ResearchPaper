 Compost based biofiltration is a method widely used to mitigate ammonia emissions during composting . To improve the efficiency of a composting biofiltration system it is necessary to determine the most effective degree of composting at which to process the packing media used in the biofiltration system . In this study materials pre composted for 20 and 30 d and mature compost that had been treated for 60 d were applied as biofilter media to remove ammonia from dairy manure composting exhaust gases . A comparison of the results revealed that the C30 biofilter not only completely removed ammonia but also produced the least nitrogen loss . The C20 biofilter exhibited an inferior performance indicating that enough pre composted time is necessary for material used as the packing media . Though the CM biofilter displayed good performance with regard to ammonia removal it had a high nitrogen loss . A spearman rank correlation matrix revealed that the abundance of nitrogen cycle genes including
