 Nowadays increasingly complex sets of indicators are used to compare and diagnose municipal solid waste management . These sets incorporate new priorities regarding sustainability and focus on measuring the progress to zero waste . Nevertheless in developing countries where MSWM is still striving to protect health from the potential impacts of waste the MSWM information available is scarce and of low quality . This work proposes a basic set of indicators for analyzing technical aspects of street cleaning waste collection and disposal in such contexts . Based on the assessment of 66 Mexican municipalities ten indicators were identified that can be calculated with the information available . For each indicator reference values were established and their performance was evaluated by means of a traffic light system . In addition a method that allows the quality of the information to be classified into four levels according to the data source its uncertainty the temporal coverage and its spatial coverage was applied .

@highlight Indicators to monitor basic MSWM operation were identified based on 66 study cases.

@highlight Study cases show what information can be available in developing countries.
@highlight A method to appraise the reliability of indicators based on data quality.
@highlight Results show the need to increase MSW collection coverage and disposal conditions.
