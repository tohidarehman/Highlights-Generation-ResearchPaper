 Wetlands provide habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species and contribute significantly to overall biodiversity in Ireland . Despite these known ecosystem services the total wetland area in Ireland has reduced significantly over the past few decades leading to an ongoing need to protect such environments . The EU Habitats Directive has recognised several wetlands types as priority habitats . This study concentrates on a subset of the priority habitats focussing on some groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems as well as raised bogs . Monitoring these sites across the country by field visits is resource intensive . Therefore this study has evaluated remote sensing as a potentially cost effective tool for monitoring the ecological health of the wetlands . Identification and presence of certain vegetation communities can indicate the condition of the wetland which can be used for monitoring for example activities causing degradation or the progress of restoration attempts . The ecological composition of the wetlands has been analysed using open source Sentinel 2 data . 10 bands of Sentinel 2 Level 2 data and 3 indices Normalised Difference Vegetation Index Enhanced Vegetation Index and Normalised Difference Water Index were used to create vegetation maps of each wetland using Bagged Tree ensemble classifier and graph cut segmentation also known as MAP maximum a
