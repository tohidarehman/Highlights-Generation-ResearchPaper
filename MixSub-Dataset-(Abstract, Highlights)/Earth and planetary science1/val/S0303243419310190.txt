 The fractional vegetation cover crop residue cover and bare soil are three important parameters in vegetationsoil ecosystems and their correct and timely estimation can improve crop monitoring and environmental monitoring . The triangular space method uses one CRC index and one vegetation index to create a triangular space in which the three vertices represent pure vegetation crop residue and bare soil . Subsequently the CRC FVC and BS of mixed remote sensing pixels can be distinguished by their spatial locations in the triangular space . However soil moisture and crop residue moisture significantly reduce the performance of broadband remote sensing CRC indices and can thus decrease the accuracy of the remote estimation and mapping of CRC FVC and BS . This study evaluated the use of broadband remote sensing the triangular space method and the random forest technique to estimate and map the FVC CRC and BS of cropland in which SM CRM changes dramatically . A spectral dataset was obtained using from a field based experiment with a field spectrometer and from a laboratory based simulation that included four distinct soil types three types of crop residue one crop and varying SM CRM . We trained an RF model that can magnify spectral features of crop residue and soil by using the broadband remote sensing angle indices as input and uses a moisture resistant hyperspectral index as the target . The effects of moisture on crop residue and soil were minimized by using the broadband CRRF . Then the CRRF NDVI triangular space method was used to estimate and map CRC FVC and BS . Our method was validated by using both laboratory and field based experiments and Sentinel 2 broadband remote sensing images . Our results indicate that the CRRF NDVI triangular space method can reduce the effect of moisture on the broadband remote sensing of CRC and may also help to obtain laboratory and field CRC FVC and BS . Thus the proposed method has great potential for application to croplands in which the SM CRM content changes dramatically .

@highlight Soil and crop residue moisture effects were minimized by broadband crop residue index from the random forest CRRF .
@highlight Broadband CRRF for dry and saturated soil and crop residue samples are very similar.
@highlight Broadband CRRF shows significant promise in areas in which the soil and crop residue moisture content changes dramatically.
