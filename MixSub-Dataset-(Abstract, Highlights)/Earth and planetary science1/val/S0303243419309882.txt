 Accurate and current road network data is fundamental to land management and emergency response yet challenging to produce for unpaved roads in rural and forested regions using traditional cartographic approaches . Automatic extraction of roads from satellite imagery using deep learning is a promising alternative gaining increasing attention however most efforts have focused on urban paved roads and used very high spatial resolution imagery which is less frequently available for rural regions . Additionally road extraction routines still struggle to produce a fully connected vectorized road network . In this study covering a large forested area in Western Canada we developed and evaluated a routine to automatically extract unpaved road pixels using a convolutional neural network and then used the CNN outputs to update a pre existing government road network and evaluate if and how it would change . To cover the large spatial extent mapped in this study we trained the routine using moderately high resolution satellite imagery from the RapidEye constellation and a ground truth dataset collected with smartphones by organizations already operating and driving in the region . Performance of the road extraction was comparable to results achieved by others using very high resolution imagery

@highlight We extracted unpaved roads from RapidEye imagery with 87 precision and 89 recall.
@highlight Post processing improved initial predictions produced by the neural network.
@highlight Results changed the public road database by 20 through additions and removals.
