 Monitoring agricultural land cover is highly relevant for global early warning systems such as ASAP because it represents the basis for detecting production deficits in food security assessment . Given the significant inconsistencies among existing land cover datasets there is a need to obtain a more accurate representation of the spatial distribution and extent of agricultural area in Africa . In this research we explore a fusion approach that combines the strength of individual datasets and minimises their limitations . Specifically a semi automatic method is developed relying on multi criteria analysis complemented with manual fine tuning using the best rated datasets to generate two hybrid and static agricultural masks one for cropland and another for grassland . Following a comprehensive selection of land cover maps each dataset is evaluated at country level according to five criteria timeliness spatial resolution comparison with FAO statistics accuracy assessment and expert evaluation . A sensitivity analysis is performed based on an evaluation of the impact of weight settings on the resulting land cover . The proposed methodology is capable of improving agricultural characterisation in Africa . As a result two static masks at 250m spatial resolution for the nominal year 2016 are provided .

@highlight A multi criteria analysis MCA is developed to generate a cropland and grassland hybrid mask.
@highlight Each land cover dataset is evaluated at country level by five different criteria.
@highlight The MCA approach offers a flexible and transparent methodology to combine different data.
@highlight The hybrid masks are used in the JRC ASAP early warning system and are freely accessible.
