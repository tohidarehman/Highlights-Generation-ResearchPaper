Yet there is a clear lack of empirical analysis of such cost implications with a view to providing convincing explanation to the phenomena . This research aims to identify the cost implications of achieving CWM related credits as stipulated in green building rating tools by focusing in Hong Kong . The costs for using materials required for green certification were calculated and compared against conventional materials by introducing a life cycle perspective . It is discovered that to obtain the CWM related credits one needs to pay a higher cost ranging from 0.4 to 6 .
