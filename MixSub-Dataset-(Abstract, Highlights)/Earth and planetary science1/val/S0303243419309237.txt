 Many real world applications require remotely sensed images at both high spatial and temporal resolutions . This requirement however is generally not met by single satellite system . A number of spatiotemporal fusion models have been developed to overcome this constraint . Landsat and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite data have been extensively used for detection and monitoring of active fires at different scales . Fusing the data obtained from these sensors will therefore significantly contribute to the satellite based monitoring of fires . Among the available spatiotemporal fusion methods the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model and enhanced STARFM algorithms have been widely used for studying the land surface dynamics in the homogeneous and heterogeneous regions . The present study explores the applicability of STARFM and ESTARFM algorithms for fusing the high spatial resolution Landsat 8 OLI data with high temporal resolution VIIRS data in the context of active surface coal fire monitoring . Further a modified version of ESTARFM algorithm referred as modified ESTARFM is developed to improve the performance of the fusion model . Jharia coalfield known for widespread occurrences of coal fires is taken as the study area . The qualitative and quantitative assessments of the predicted Landsat like images from different algorithms indicate that the modified ESTARFM outperforms the other fusion approaches used in this study . Considering the advantages limitations and performance of the algorithms used modified ESTARFM along with STARFM can be used for surface coal fire monitoring . The study will not only contribute to remote sensing based coal fire studies but also to other applications such as forest fires crop residue burning land cover and land use change vegetation phenology etc .
