 In England and Wales there are at least 1700 coastal landfills in the coastal flood plain and at least 60 threatened by erosion illustrating a global problem . These landfills are a major issue in shoreline management planning which aims to manage the risks associated with flooding and coastal erosion . Where landfills exist hold the line is often selected as the preferred SMP option although government funding is not available at present . To investigate these issues in detail three case study landfills are used to examine the risks of future flooding and erosion together with potential mitigation options . These cases represent a contrasting range of coastal landfill settings . The study includes consideration of sea level rise and climate change which exacerbates risks of erosion and flooding of landfills . It is fundamental to recognise that the release of solid waste in coastal zones is a problem with a geological timescale and these problems will not go away if ignored . Future erosion and release of solid waste is found to be more of a threat than flooding and leachate release from landfills . However while leachate release can be assessed there is presently a lack of methods to assess the risks from the release of solid waste . Hence a lack of science constrains the design of remediation options .
