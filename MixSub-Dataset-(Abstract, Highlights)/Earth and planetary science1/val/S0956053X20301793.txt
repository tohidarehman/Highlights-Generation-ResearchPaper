 There is a growing need to recycle construction and demolition waste in order to treat the huge amount of CDW in many metropolises of China . However the CDW recycling industry is still in its initial stage and developed unevenly across various areas of China . In spite of some qualitative discussions the quantitative analysis of crucial policies to the development of CDW recycling industry was overlooked . Through literature review nine influential policy instruments were identified in term of three categories i.e . control and command policy market based policy and information based policy . The stepwise regression analysis was employed to explore the relationships between the influential policies and the development level of CDW recycling industry in 52 sample Chinese cities . The results demonstrated that Green Product Label Charge and Tax and Technical Standards had statistically significant association with the development of CDW recycling industry in sample cities . In the surveyed cities Charge or Tax was the most common policy tool but Green Product Label and Technological standards were rather less frequently employed . According to the results Green Product Label and Technical Standards should be given higher priority . In addition landfill charge should be introduced as a fundamental impetus . These results provide directions for other cities to facilitate the development of their CDW recycling industry .

@highlight Key policies to promote the CDW recycling are quantitatively explored.
@highlight The stepwise regression was employed to evaluate the effect of the nine policies.
@highlight Green product label is the top policy followed by Charge and Tax and Technical Standard.
@highlight 84.6 of the sample cities employed the Charge and Tax.
@highlight The ratios were only 11.5 for Technical Standard and 7.7 for Green Product Label.
