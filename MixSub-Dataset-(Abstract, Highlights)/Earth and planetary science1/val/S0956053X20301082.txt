 Impurities in biowaste such as plastics glass metals and inert material negatively impact the operation of anaerobic digestion plants and compost quality and have to be removed prior to the anaerobic digestion process . Different mechanical pretreatments are available for this purpose . However data on the removal efficiencies of pretreatment systems for different types of biowaste and for different kinds of impurities are still scarce . This study aims to determine the efficiencies for impurity removal of four biowaste pretreatment plants at real scale drum screen shredder piston press shredder piston press screw press separation mill and pulper drum screen . BTP 1 treats mixed food and garden wastes while BTP 2 3 and 4 treat mostly food waste . The efficiency of the pretreatment systems was influenced by the type of pretreated biowaste . The recovery of organics by the press was more efficient when pretreating food waste than for treating mixed food and garden wastes . BTP 3 presented the highest recovery of biogas but also the highest transfer of inert particles to the substrate . On the contrary BTP 4 was the most efficient for the removal of inert particles however this system also presented 18 loss of biogas potential .

@highlight Four biowaste pretreatment systems for impurity removal were investigated.
@highlight Two types of biowaste were tested food waste and mixed food and garden waste.
@highlight Bulky material in mixed food and garden waste caused high losses of organics.
@highlight The selection of the best technology should be customized for each waste type.
