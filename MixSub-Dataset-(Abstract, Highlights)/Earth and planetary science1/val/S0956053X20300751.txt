 In this study the feasibility of using municipal solid waste incineration fly ash as additive for the strengthening of pretreated cement stabilized soil was evaluated . Results indicated that the leaching concentrations of chromium and lead in MSWIFA after the water washing process and addition of 4 ferrous sulphate were reduced by 67 and 89 respectively which was lower than the limit value of Identification standard for hazardous waste . After pretreatment MSWIFA samples with ratios of 5 and 10 were blended into cement stabilized soil with ordinary Portland cement content of 10 15 and 20 . The unconfined compressive strength internal friction angle and cohesion of the cement stabilized soil increased with OPC and pretreated MSWIFA content . The same effect was observed on UCS after the addition of 10 PFA as replacement of 5 OPC . In the subsequent X ray powder diffraction test scanning electron microscopy and leaching tests the leaching concentrations of heavy metals in cement stabilized soil became far lower than the limit value under the synergistic effects of the physical encapsulation of hydration products and stabilization of chemical agents . The incorporation of PFA as a

@highlight MSWIFA is used for cement stabilized soil after pretreatment.
@highlight PFA effectively promotes the hydration reaction in cement stabilized soil.
@highlight 10 PFA can replace 5 OPC as a supplementary cementitious material.
