 Until today there are still many problems that must be solved through innovative research to make the recycling of spent lead acid batteries and the separation of Pb Sb alloy more environmentally friendly and energy saving . In this paper a novel method for regenerating lead paste by vacuum reduction reaction coupling with separation of Pb Sb alloy was developed . In this process antimony from Pb Sb alloy is used to reduce desulfurized lead paste into lead under vacuum while it is oxidized into volatile Sb

@highlight A novel technology for atomic economic recovery of lead paste is proposed.
@highlight Direct recovery ratio of Pb reaches 99.29 which means that Pb loss is very little.
@highlight Sb content in crude Pb Sb alloy decreased from 46 to 0.98 .
@highlight The technology has advantages of lower cost and less pollution etc.
