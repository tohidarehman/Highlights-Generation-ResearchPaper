 Over the past few years supercritical water oxidation has shown great potential for application to landfill leachate treatment providing substantial organic matter degradation in terms of biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon . However the conversion of ammonia which is present at high concentrations in leachates is the rate limiting step during ScWO and usually requires large amounts of oxidants the addition of catalysts or severe operating conditions . Aiming at proposing a treatment system that effectively removes both organic matter and ammonia from leachate this paper evaluates the intensification of the ScWO process through ion exchange with zeolite . Thus ScWO was operated under a pressure of 23MPa at 600 and 700C without the addition of oxidants . The zeolite was used without any modification inside a glass column . The ScWO zeolite system removed 90 ammoniacal nitrogen NH

@highlight Ion exchange was applied to ScWO as a subsequent step for ammonia removal.
@highlight ScWO was operated without the addition of oxidants or supplementary substances.
@highlight The effect of temperature and recycling on ScWO reactor were evaluated.
@highlight ScWO ion exchange system reduced 81 of TOC and 90 of NH
@highlight  N.
@highlight ScWO ion exchange system removed color and turbidity effectively 98 .
