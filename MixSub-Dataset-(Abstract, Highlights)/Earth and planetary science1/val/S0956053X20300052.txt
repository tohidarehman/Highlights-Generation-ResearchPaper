 The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is an emergent unknown environmental problem linked to increased production and consumption of pharmaceuticals and as such understanding risk perception is fundamental . This study focuses on exploring causes and effects of environmental and health risk perception . Survey data was collected in Portugal Spain and France . Data illustrated that in France where the quantity of recycled pharmaceuticals is much higher respondents reported a higher need for knowledge but not a higher risk perception nor self reported behaviour . Although previous research illustrates that higher trust correlates with lower risk perception we found a positive correlation which highlights the need to comprehend these variables in emergent risks . Results further confirmed a hypothesized moderated mediation model to explain proper disposal behaviour . We found an indirect effect of risk perception on behaviour through intention which was stronger for participants with higher environmental identity . Understanding the causes and effects of risk perception of pharmaceuticals in the environment thereby contributes to improve pharmaceutical waste management processes and to promote the proper disposal of pharmaceuticals .

@highlight Pharmaceuticals in the environment is an emergent risk often unknown by the public.
@highlight Need to promote the proper disposal of household pharmaceutical leftovers.
@highlight Stage models of behaviour change highlight the relevance of risk perception.
@highlight Survey data shows that risk perception related to intention and disposal behaviour.
@highlight Environmental identity promoted the translation of intention to disposal behaviour.
