 Hydrothermal conversion of sewage sludge and its relevant model compounds such as cellulose glucose lignin and soybean protein was experimentally conducted at moderate reaction temperature of 260C for 60min . The structural properties carbon containing groups and microstructure of the char were characterised by several techniques . The results revealed that more benzene rings were formed by small clusters and the C

@highlight Sewage sludge can be efficiently converted to chars with ZSM 5 catalyst by HTC.
@highlight HTC process improved decomposition of C
@highlight O band on Aryl alkyl ether.
@highlight SS derived char possess high graphite degree with ZSM 5 assistance.
@highlight The size of the char become smaller after using ZSM 5 catalyst.
@highlight Proposed scheme of the main pathway of model compounds during HTC.
