 Thermal hydrolysis pretreatments coupled to anaerobic digestion are implemented to treat municipal solids but limited study indicates whether THP AD materials merit different land application rates than AD biosolids without THP . Three AD biosolids types with either no pretreatment THP or two hour fermentation were evaluated for differences in leachable dissolved organic matter DOM decomposition and nitrogen releases in biosolids incubated in sandy loam soil . DOM characterizations of size exclusion chromatography FTIR and fluorescence maxima Ex 400nm indicated similarities in among AD DOM that contrasted waste activated sludge Milorganite and Suwannee River Organic Matter . Fluorescence peak picking was a more adaptable analysis for shifted leachate spectra than fluorescence regional integration . Peak ratio analysis is recommended over FRI for biosolids DOM . The 3 month net inorganic N produced in biosolids soil incubations was 15512.1 14918.2 14017.4 and 35415.1mgN kg for AD biosolids with no pretreatment fermentation AD THP AD and Milorganite respectively . Overall there was limited evidence of differences in leachable organic matter quality or net mineral N release after 105days for AD solids with or without THP . Red shifted fluorescence of leachates decayed by day 45 in aerobic biosolids soil incubations suggesting that larger complex carbon sources liberated during solids stabilization may decompose readily in soils . Overall other variables may have a greater influence on final nutrient releases and organic matter quality than full scale pretreatments to AD alone . Critical and targeted application of DOM spectroscopy specific to biosolid leachates will improve use in advanced stabilization studies .
