 This paper reported on the fabrication of nanofibrous membranes from various sources of expanded polystyrene waste using electrospinning technique and their application as air filter media . The filter membranes were made from four EPS waste sources i.e . food packaging EPS craft instant noodle cup and electronic packaging . The properties of the membranes fabricated from those sources were compared to obtain the best EPS waste source for air filter application . To make the precursor solutions those samples were dissolved in d limonene DMF with the concentration of 15 20 and 25wt . The solid EPS density solution viscosity and surface tension were measured . The fiber diameter and morphology of nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy for each EPS variation . The fabricated membrane properties and filtration properties pressure drop PM

@highlight Expanded polystyrene EPS waste has been recycled into nanofibrous membranes by electrospinning method.
@highlight Four EPS waste sources were used as raw materials.
@highlight The produced nanofibrous membranes were used as air filtration application.
@highlight The results indicated that the EPS nanofiber membranes had great potential as an air filter media.
