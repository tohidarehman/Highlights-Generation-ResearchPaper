 Land and Sea Surface Temperatures are both recognized as Essential Climate Variables and are routinely retrieved by a wealth of satellites . However for validated approaches the latest data are usually not available to the general public . We offer to bridge this gap by using Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager with its 15min temporal resolution . Here we present generic algorithms for the retrieval of both LST and SST valid for the SEVIRI instrument onboard MSG platforms 811 which we validate using hourly data of 4 ground stations and 11 buoys in Spain over the years 2015 to 2018 . These validations show that in the best conditions of surface homogeneity errors in our LST estimation are below 1.5K for stations with good thermal homogeneity . Comparison with LSA SAF LST shows differences below 2K for most of SEVIRI disk with higher differences in arid areas and during daytime . As for SST retrieval the average error amount to 0.67K for cloud free buoy data . These algorithms have been implemented in a near real time processing chain which provide actualized LST and SST maps every 15min within 5min of image reception . These maps along with other products can be freely consulted from a dedicated webpage
