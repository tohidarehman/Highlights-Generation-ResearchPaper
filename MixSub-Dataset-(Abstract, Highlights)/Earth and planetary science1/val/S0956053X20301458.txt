 Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances are found in many consumer products which will be ultimately disposed in landfills . Limiting environmental contamination and future exposures will require managing leachates from different types of landfills each with different PFAS levels depending upon the source of the waste . The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of waste type and on site treatment on PFAS levels in landfill leachates . Eleven PFAS species were evaluated in leachates from municipal solid waste construction and demolition MSW ash and a mixture of MSWA and MSW with landfill gas condensate . Leachates were also analyzed before and after on site treatment at two of these facilities . Results indicate that MSWA leachate had significantly lower PFAS levels relative to other leachate types . Lower total PFAS concentrations in MSWA leachates were correlated with an increase in incineration temperature R

@highlight Eleven PFAS species were measured in landfill leachates along with pH and COD.
@highlight Leachates from ash landfills had lower levels of PFAS relative to MSW C D landfills.
@highlight PFAS from ash landfills was correlated with temperatures used to generate the ash.
@highlight Treatment of MSW leachate at 1 site resulted in increased levels of carboxylated PFAS.
