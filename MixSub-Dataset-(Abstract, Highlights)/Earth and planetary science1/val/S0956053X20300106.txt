 The study compares the environmental performances of a new generation large scale combustion based waste to energy unit active since 2010 with those of different virtual units defined in the light of the Best Available Techniques REFerence document for Waste Incineration published by the European Community on December 2019 . The average performances of these units have been evaluated in terms of air emissions material consumptions and energy recovery based on data related to 355 existing European waste incineration lines and those established for the future new plants . An attributional Life Cycle Assessment has been used to compare and quantify the environmental performances of the selected units all equipped with a moving grate furnace and similar air pollution control systems . A sensitivity analysis quantifies how even more severe requests for emission and energy performances as well as the evolution of the European electricity mix until the year 2030 can affect the comparative assessment . The results indicate that the considered large scale waste to energy plant has good environmental performances even in an electricity mix characterised by 45 of renewable sources . This allows an easy compliance with the Best Available Techniques Associated Emission Levels of the new waste incineration BREF document . Possible further improvements of its performances should be focused mainly on a further increase of the energy efficiency provided that it is economically viable .

@highlight A modern WtE is compared with virtual units defined in the light of the 2019 BREF.
@highlight An LCA was used to quantify the environmental performances of the selected units.
@highlight A sensitivity analysis investigated the effects of the European electricity mix of 2030.
@highlight The existing WtE has always an easy compliance with the 2019 BATC.
