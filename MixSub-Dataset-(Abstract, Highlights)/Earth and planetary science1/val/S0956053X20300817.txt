 The recalcitrance of green waste caused by its high lignocellulose content is a technical challenge for accelerating green waste composting . Adjusting the initial ratio of total carbon and total nitrogen to the optimal range of 2530 1 is a common strategy to accelerate the composting process . However because microorganisms can only utilize hydrosoluble nutrients directly we investigated whether maintaining the ratio of hydrosoluble carbon and hydrosoluble nitrogen within the optimal range through continuous urea addition can better accelerate green waste composting . We conducted a pilot scale composting experiment in which the aforementioned maintaining started at the beginning of composting or after the thermophilic phase . The results demonstrate that maintaining the optimal HC HN ratio starting at both periods can to some extent direct the TC TN ratio toward 2530 1 and can also significantly improve heat generation pH lignocellulose degradation and humification . Moreover lignin degradation was improved by 3.157.33 cellulose degradation was improved by 6.488.15 and carbon content of humus was increased by 7.1916.13 . Although the maturity assessment showed that none of the final compost reached maturity within the limited experimental period based on the promoted lignocellulose degradation and humification we conclude that maintaining the HC HN ratio within the optimal range is a more efficient method to accelerate green waste composting compared to the initial TC TN adjustment only once .
