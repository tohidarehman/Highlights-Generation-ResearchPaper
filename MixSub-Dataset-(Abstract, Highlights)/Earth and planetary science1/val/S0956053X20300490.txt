 Cork is light porous carbon rich and renewable which leads to competitive advantages in the preparation of biochar as compared to other biomass material . In this work we propose to convert cork powder into cork based biochar as Cu adsorbent via slow pyrolysis thereby providing a reliable and simple method for recycling cork industrial waste . The physicochemical properties of cork based biochar prepared under different pyrolysis temperatures and pyrolysis time were characterized by elemental analysis FT IR XRD N

@highlight Providing a simple and reliable method for utilize industrial waste cork.
@highlight Relations between pyrolysis conditions and biochar characteristics were revealed.
@highlight The specific surface area of cork biochar 392.5m
@highlight  g surpasses most biochars.
@highlight Cork biochar exhibits superior Cu II adsorption capacity 18.5mg g and fast adsorption speed.
