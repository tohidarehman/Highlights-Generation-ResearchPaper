 Mapping heathland habitats is generally challenging due to fine scale habitats as well as spectral ambiguities between different classes . A multi seasonal time series of multispectral RapidEye data from several phenological stages was analysed towards the classification of different vegetation communities .

@highlight We propose a multi level hierarchical classification approach.
@highlight The approach is tested by mapping a heathland area.
@highlight We compare two aggregation methods for the multi level maps.
@highlight We discuss trade offs between the level classes and the classification accuracy.
