 A general approach to managing municipal solid waste is by incineration . Unfortunately large amounts of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash is produced in the process with their heavy metals content posing further problems to the environment . One fundamental treatment of MSWI FA heavy metals is called solidification stabilization where MSWI FA is solidified in cement based materials to cap hazardous elements from being released into the environment . Mortar formed from this cement mixed with MSWI FA suffer from decreased compressive strength due to their chloride and sulfate contents . Thus pre treatment of MSWI FA to remove these salts before producing mortar is desirable . This study investigated treating MSWI FA with deionized water 0.01M and 0.1M nitric acid and 0.1M and 0.25M sodium carbonate to remove chloride and sulfate . Physical and chemical structures of treated and untreated MSWI FA was studied to understand the chloride and sulfate removal mechanisms . Treated MSWI FA was used as cement replacement in mortar and the compressive strength was tested . Results suggest that all of the treatment solutions tested in this study can equally remove chloride but sodium carbonate can remove sulfate at the highest extent . In addition mortar with deionized water treated MSWI FA gave the highest compressive strength . Heavy metals leaching was tested by the Toxicity Characterization Leaching Procedure method with results passing the standard .

@highlight Chloride and sulfate removal from municipal solid waste incineration fly ashes using acid base solutions were studied.
@highlight Basic solutions were better at removing sulfate from contaminated fly ash.
@highlight DI water as treated solution gave highest efficiency in improving mortar strength.
@highlight Leaching heavy metals from mortar containing municipal solid waste incineration fly ashes passed the standard.
