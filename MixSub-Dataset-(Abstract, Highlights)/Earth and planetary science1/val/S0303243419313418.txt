 Most studies have the achieved rapid and accurate determination of soil organic carbon using laboratory spectroscopy however it remains difficult to map the spatial distribution of SOC . To predict and map SOC at a regional scale we obtained fourteen hyperspectral images from the Gaofen 5 satellite and decomposed and reconstructed the original reflectance and the first derivative reflectance using discrete wavelet transform at different scales . At these different scales as inputs we selected the 3 optimal bands with the highest weight coefficient using principal component analysis and chose the normalized difference index ratio index and difference index with the strongest correlation with the SOC content using a contour map method . These inputs were then used to build regional scale SOC prediction models using random forest support vector machine and back propagation neural network algorithms . The results indicated that 1 at a low decomposition scale DWT can effectively eliminate the noise in satellite hyperspectral data and the FDR combined with DWT can improve the SOC prediction accuracy significantly 2 the method of selecting inputs using principal component analysis and a contour map can eliminate the redundancy of hyperspectral data while retaining the physical meaning of the inputs . For the model with the highest prediction accuracy the inputs were all derived from the wavelength range of SOC variations 3 the differences in prediction accuracy among the different prediction models are small and 4 the SOC prediction accuracy using hyperspectral satellite data is greatly improved compared with that of previous SOC prediction studies using multispectral satellite data . This study provides a highly robust and accurate method for predicting and mapping regional SOC contents .
