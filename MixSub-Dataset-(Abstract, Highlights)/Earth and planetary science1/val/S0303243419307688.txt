 With the advent of social sensing in the Big Data era location based social media data are increasingly used to explore anthropogenic activities and their impacts on the environment . This study converts a typical kind of LBSM data geo tagged tweets into raster images at the 500m spatial resolution and compares them with the new generation nighttime lights image products the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day Night Band monthly image composites . The results show that the monthly tweet images are significantly correlated with the VIIRS DNB images at the pixel level . The tweet images have nearly the same ability on estimating electric power consumption and better performance on assessing personal incomes and population than the NTL images . Tweeted areas are closer to satellite derived built up urban areas than lit areas in NTL imagery making tweet images an alternative to delimit extents of human activities . Moreover the monthly tweet images do not show apparent seasonal changes and the values of tweet images are more stable across different months than VIIRS DNB monthly image composites . This study explores the potential of LBSM data at relatively fine spatiotemporal resolutions to estimate or map socioeconomic factors as an alternative to NTL images in the United States .

@highlight Geo tagged tweets were produced as tweet images at 500m resolution.
@highlight Monthly tweet images are closely correlated with VIIRS DNB images at the pixel level.
@highlight Tweet images can be used to assess or map human activities similarly to NTL images.
@highlight Monthly tweet images are more stable free of seasonal effects than VIIRS DNB images.
