 This work evaluates the potential of hydrothermal carbonization to valorize the digestate derived from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge into useful materials for P and energy recovery . The hydrothermal treatment of digestate at 180240C did not lead to high rank hydrochars . On the other hand inorganic P concentration did not change with the temperature while as the carbonization temperature increased the organic P retention yield in hydrochar became lower increasing the total P in the process water obtained at the highest temperature up to 25.3 . P recovery from acid leaching of the hydrochar obtained at 180C via precipitation with CaO at pH up to 9 led to a brown solid precipitate with total P content close to 42mgg

@highlight Thermal treatment improves digestate P leachability.
@highlight Acid leaching led to lignite like upgraded hydrochars with HHV.
@highlight Leachate neutralisation with CaO enabled the precipitation of P rich brown solids.
@highlight High energy recovery was obtained hydrochars and methane from AD of PW .
