 In this paper excavated waste was added to sewage sludge for co pyrolysis aiming to stablize the heavy metals in sewage sludge . The effect of co pyrolysis with various pretreatment on heavy metals stabilization was studied using orthogonal test . The results showed that the optimal conditions are 600C nitrogen flow rate of 200mL min mixing excavated waste with sewage sludge and hydrothermal pretreatment . 90 of the heavy metals in the sewage sludge and excavated waste mixtures were transformed to biochars after co pyrolysis . Moreover the state of heavy metals changed from bio available fractions to stable state thereby reducing the potential ecological risk index from 116.8 to below 50 which represented a reduction in contamination levels and ecological risks from considerate to low . Finally the study found that the synergy between hydrothermal and pyrolysis made full use of the moisture in sewage sludge and was more conducive to the solidification of heavy metals . This paper provides a good option to dispose multiple wastes and reduce their environmental risks .

@highlight Sewage sludge was co pyrolysed with excavated waste for heavy metals stabilization.
@highlight Hydrothermal pretreatment was applied to stabilize heavy metals.
@highlight Heavy metals converted from highly available to stable forms after co pyrolysis.
@highlight Hydrothermal pretreatment can reduce ecological risk of heavy metals in biochars.
