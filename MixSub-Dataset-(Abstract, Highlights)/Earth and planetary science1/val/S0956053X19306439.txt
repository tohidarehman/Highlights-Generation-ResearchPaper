 At present in Europe 18 million tonnes of MSWI Bottom Ash is annually stockpiled or used in low grade applications . Therefore alternative applications such as aggregate or as a cement component in concrete are stimulated . Physical and chemical characteristics remaining after treatment however prevent its extensive application in building materials . Hence knowledge is needed on the distinct properties of the material classes making up a heterogeneous BA enabling the assessment of its characteristics and the resulting applicability . Furthermore a user friendly composition assessment procedure is necessary to evaluate the output of physical treatment processes . Crushing is a commonly applied treatment and its effect on the material classes comprising BA is still unknown . In this paper the latter are identified and classified into slag magnetic slag glass refractory metals and unburned material classes . The individual characteristics of each material class are identified and a suitable tracer for tracking these classes in heterogeneous samples is defined . Furthermore a fast method to quantify the distribution of material classes based just on the oxide composition is developed and applied to approximate the changes in the configuration of BA through crushing . It is concluded that although the jaw crushing of BA results in a more homogeneous distribution beneficiation of material classes occurs and selective crushing is possible in order to improve the quality of the BA and therefore its subsequent application .

@highlight Distinct physical and chemical properties of MSWI BA classes were determined.
@highlight Magnetic separation of ferrous containing slag is suggested for beneficiation.
@highlight The proposed model enables the calculation of a MSWI BA class composition.
@highlight The behaviour of MSWI BA classes during crushing was determined using the model.
@highlight Selective crushing of MSWI BA is found applicable for material class beneficiation.
