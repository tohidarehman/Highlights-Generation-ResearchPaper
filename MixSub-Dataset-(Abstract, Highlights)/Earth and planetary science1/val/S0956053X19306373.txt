 The increasing use of forest biomass as a fuel for power plants due to environmental concerns will certainly increase the amount of woody biomass ash produced . Because of the environmental problems derived from woody biomass ash disposal an important aspect for the sustainable development of the energy sector is the implementation of effective ash management strategies . The purpose of this study is to assess the environmental impacts of woody biomass ash landfarming for soil amelioration through a Life Cycle Assessment . The baseline scenario corresponds to the current most common practice of woody biomass ash management and two different landfarming alternatives were assessed liming and fertilisation . Credits were given to the system due to the substitution of three traditional liming products and five traditional fertilisers . Woody biomass ash landfarming presented satisfactory performance in five impact categories under study in comparison to landfilling . When woody biomass ash was used for liming the environmental savings were more pronounced when substituting hydrated lime . For potassium supply the substitution of potassium nitrate by woody biomass ash presented the best environmental performance while for phosphorus supply the environmental savings were more pronounced substituting single superphosphate . However in four impact categories the environmental impacts of ash landfarming exceeded the impacts of ash landfilling due to the emission to soil of nutrients and trace elements to soil . But this does not necessarily imply increased risks for the environment as the potential pollutants leaching depends on their bioavailability in the soil .

@highlight The valorisation of woody biomass ash for soil amelioration was assessed.
@highlight Life cycle assessment was used to assess the potential environmental impacts.
@highlight Ash landfarming had a lower impact than ash landfilling for most impact categories.
@highlight The impacts in human health showed that ash landfarming may not be a safe practice.
