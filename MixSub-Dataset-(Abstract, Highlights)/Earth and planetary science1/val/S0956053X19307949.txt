 Several of the waste materials that have a negative impact on the sewer system are produced by fats oils and greases discharged from commercial and domestic kitchens . These materials accumulate at different points in the sewer catchment from kitchens to pumping stations sewers and sewage treatment works and comprise oily wastewater floating agglomerates and hard deposits . Despite their detrimental effects these waste materials have a high calorific content and are an ideal feedstock for energy recovery processes . So far the overall volume of each type of waste and their physical chemical properties in relation to their collection point are unknown . However from a management point of view knowledge on each feedstock quality and volumes is necessary to develop an economic viable solution for their collection and for energy recovery purposes . In this study FOG wastes collected from households food service establishments sewage pumping stations sewers and STWs were compared to sewage sludge in terms of organic contents and energy potentials . As expected FOG recovered at source were cleaner and had a higher energy content . Once mixed with wastewater the materials changed in composition and lost some of their energy per unit mass . Our results showed that around 94 730 tonnes.year

@highlight 240 TWh.year
@highlight could be generated from food outlets FOG in the London area.
@highlight FOG collected further away from source were richer in water and other contaminants.
@highlight FOG demonstrated high biomethane potentials.
@highlight Lipids accounted for most of the organic in FOG.
@highlight A shift from unsaturated to saturated fats was noticed from source to end point.
