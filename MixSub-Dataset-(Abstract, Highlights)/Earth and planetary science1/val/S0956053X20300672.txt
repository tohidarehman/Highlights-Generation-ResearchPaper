 In the second half of the 20th century asbestos extraction was up to 4 Mt year . Due to its high strength and insulation properties this mineral was used as an additive in building materials . Over time these materials were destroyed by the process of weathering and leaching . Asbestos fibers in dust form penetrate the respiratory system causing diseases . This article proposes the binding of hazardous asbestos fibers in a polymer matrix formed from waste cooking oil .

@highlight Blocks containing waste cooking oil and asbestos waste were obtained.
@highlight Asbestos fibers has been embedded into oil matrix to prevent dusting.
@highlight Physicochemical and strength properties of materials were determined.
@highlight Statistical methods were applied for analysis of obtained results.
