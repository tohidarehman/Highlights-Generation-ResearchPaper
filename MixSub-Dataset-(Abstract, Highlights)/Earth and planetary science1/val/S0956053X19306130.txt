 Co pelletization of sewage sludge and conventional fuels for combustion is considered to be a feasible SS disposal method . Oxy fuel combustion is recognized as a promising technology to reduce the emission of CO

@highlight The combustion of single particles from SS PS and SS BC was studied.
@highlight Increasing SS blending ratio speeds up ignition but decreases combustion temperature.
@highlight The addition of steam promotes ignition and combustion.
