 The recycling of waste plastics is of considerable significance with environmental and economic benefits while available separation approaches have been considered as a major bottleneck for its widespread application . Thus we proposed a simple method flotation along with surface modification to separate waste acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and polyvinylchloride mixtures . Single factor experiment was conducted to determine the critical parameters in surface modification . Surface response methodology using Box Behnken Design was performed to optimize separation performance . The quadratic models were generated to predict the floatability of acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and the difference between the floatability of polyvinylchloride and acrylonitrile butadienestyrene . The model was also utilized to determine optimized conditions by desirability approaches . The optimized conditions were concentration 0.18M temperature 75.00C treatment time 11.50min along with stirring rate 200rpm . The efficient separation of acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and polyvinylchloride was achieved yielding recovery of 98.40 and purity of 98.43 . The experimental responses well agreed with predicted values demonstrating the accuracy of the prediction model . The formed hydrophilic groups coated iron oxide and signs of corrosion were confirmed as the major mechanism for the selective surface hydrophilization of acrylonitrile butadienestyrene . Consequently this method is feasible for separation of waste acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and polyvinylchloride mixtures and can be expected to promote the sustainable recycling of waste plastics .
