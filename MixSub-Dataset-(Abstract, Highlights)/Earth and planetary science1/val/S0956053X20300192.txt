 Waste management historically focused on the protection of human health and the natural environment from the impacts of littering and dispersion of pollutants .

The legal definition of waste overlooks the context of waste fails to consider the interests of the waste user as opposed to the waste holder and aims to control the impacts of careless discarding rather than stimulating careful discarding . To address these challenges we suggest a legal requirement to recognise the potential of waste to be used operationalised by formulating a waste
