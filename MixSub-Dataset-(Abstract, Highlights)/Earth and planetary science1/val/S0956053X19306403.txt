 Pyrolysis combined to either thermal cracking or catalytic cracking of municipal solid waste was performed in a laboratory scale facility consisting of a fixed bed reactor followed by a tubular cracking reactor . The results showed great potential for the production of syngas . The incorporation of inexpensive and widely available dolomite in the cracking reactor favoured the catalytic cracking of the primary pyrolysis products towards H

@highlight A two stage pyrolysis and thermal or catalytic cracking of MSW was carried out.
@highlight Calcined dolomite was considered as an effective catalyst for syngas production.
@highlight A valuable syngas consisting of more than 80vol of CO and H
@highlight was produced.
@highlight A solid refuse derived fuel was obtained for further energy requirements.
