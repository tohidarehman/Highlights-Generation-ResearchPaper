 The majority of the boreal forests in Finland are regularly thinned or clear cut and these actions are regulated by the Forest Act . To generate a near real time tool for monitoring management actions an automatic change detection modelling chain was developed using Sentinel 2 satellite images . In this paper we focus mainly on the error evaluation of this automatized workflow to understand and mitigate incorrect change detections . Validation material related to clear cut thinned and unchanged areas was collected by visual evaluation of VHR images which provided a feasible and relatively accurate way of evaluating forest characteristics without a need for prohibitively expensive fieldwork . This validation data was then compared to model predictions classified in similar change categories . The results indicate that clear cuts can be distinguished very reliably but thinned stands exhibit more variation . For thinned stands coverage of broadleaved trees and detections from certain single dates were found to correlate with the success of the modelling results . In our understanding this relates mainly to image quality regarding haziness and translucent clouds . However if the growing season is short and cloudiness frequent there is a clear trade off between the availability of good quality images and their preferred annual span . Gaining optimal results therefore depends both on the targeted change types and the requirements of the mapping frequency .
