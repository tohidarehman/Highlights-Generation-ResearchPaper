 This paper provides evidence that ownership and organization matters for the efficiency of the provision of public services . The results confirm trade offs implied by the property rights literature and provide important policy implications regarding the organization of public service provision . We find that pure private ownership is more efficient than pure public ownership and public ownership is more efficient than mixed ownership . The delegation of management in different legal forms also has an impact highlighting the importance of the design of the government operator relationship . We apply a structural approach of a production function estimation ensuring precise determination of total factor productivity for a panel of German garbage collection firms between 2000 and 2012 followed by a projection of those total factor productivity estimates on ownership and organization .

@highlight We create a unique data set of firms providing public services in Germany between 2000 and 2012.
@highlight We create a finer measure of organizational structure beyond the standard public private dichotomy by including mixed ownership and different types of public firms.
@highlight We use structural estimation of production function and project productivity estimates on organizational structure.
@highlight We confirm empirically the conjecture of the property rights literature that private firms are more efficient than public ones in refuse collection but find that this does not hold for mixed ownership.
@highlight Additionally we find productivity effects of the organizational structure within publicly owned firms that can be denoted to be driven by the mechanisms of the agency literature highlighting the role of choosing carefully the right organizational form for services provided.
