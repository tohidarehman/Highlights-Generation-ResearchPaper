 When consumers have noisy information bundling experience goods can signal high quality in a simple static model . When consumers are partially informed bundling has a bigger negative impact on the sales of a low quality firm than on the sales of a firm with two high quality products . Bundling can also signal high quality by restricting total sales even when consumers are uninformed . However I argue this is not a likely explanation for bundling because raising prices is always a more profitable way to restrict total sales than bundling .

@highlight Product bundling signals high quality by restricting demand when consumers are partially informed which is less costly for high quality firms.
@highlight Product bundling can restrict demand when consumers are different but in this case raising price restricts demand more effectively.
@highlight .The simple signaling model here obtains results previously derived in more complex and more dynamic models.
