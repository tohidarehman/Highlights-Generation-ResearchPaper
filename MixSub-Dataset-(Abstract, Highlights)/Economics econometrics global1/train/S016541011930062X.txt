 Within the UK s proactive financial reporting enforcement regime we examine the effect of increased regulatory scrutiny on equity values . We find that a fourfold increase in the likelihood of regulator initiated reviews of financial reports reduces equity values by 1.3 on average . Reductions in equity values are largest for firms with strong private oversight that likely ensures that they are closer to their equity value maximizing level of transparency . Additional evidence suggests that competition increases and that managers investment horizons decrease in industries selected for increased regulatory scrutiny consistent with direct compliance costs not fully explaining the reduction in equity values .
