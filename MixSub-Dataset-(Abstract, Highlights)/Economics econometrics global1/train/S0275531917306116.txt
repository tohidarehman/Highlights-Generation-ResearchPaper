 In this paper we assess whether the link between charter value and systemic risk in banking is affected by credit information sharing at the country level . Using a sample of Asian listed banks we document that banks with higher charter value exhibit lower systemic risk because these banks hold more capital . Nevertheless we find that the self disciplining role of charter value in banking is more pronounced for countries with lower depth of credit information sharing . Specifically our findings also reveal that higher charter value alleviates systemic risk and increases capitalization particularly in countries with lower quality of private credit bureaus . These findings suggest that higher charter value can be detrimental for financial stability due to an increase in bank systemic risk particularly when private credit bureaus are of better quality . In order to overcome bank systemic risk this paper advocates the importance of strengthening bank competition to limit charter value in addition to promoting the development of private credit bureaus .
