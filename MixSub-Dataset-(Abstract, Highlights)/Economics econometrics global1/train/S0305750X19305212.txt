 The capabilities approach provides a rich framework for welfare assessment but its practical relevance is limited by methodological difficulties associated with the measurement of human capabilities . We argue that unlike existing approaches to capability estimation Bayesian stochastic frontier analysis is consistent with the key features of the capabilities approach and thus provides a natural framework for estimating capabilities . Using simulated data we show that BSFA outperforms the leading alternatives in comparable settings . We further show that our approach is more flexible than the alternatives BSFA can provide cardinal representations of entire capability sets and can be used with continuous discrete and multivariate outcomes . Finally we provide an empirical illustration of our estimator by examining the impact of Ugandas Youth Opportunities Program on the educational capabilities of children in the treated households .
