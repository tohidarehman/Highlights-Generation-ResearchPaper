Results show that risk perceptions significantly impact the dynamic correlation between the U.S. market and the leading stock markets of the world . Further in 17 out of 20 international stock markets risk perceptions Granger cause dynamic correlations . The impact of VIX is positive on the correlation of the U.S. market with European and Latin American markets . In contrast the relationship of the U.S. market with all the Asian markets weakens as the VIX index rises .
