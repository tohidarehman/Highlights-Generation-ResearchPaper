 To facilitate applications in general insurance some extensions are proposed to cluster weighted models . First we extend CWMs to have generalized cluster weighted models by allowing modeling of non Gaussian distribution of the continuous covariates as they frequently occur in insurance practice . Secondly we introduce a zero inflated extension of GCWM for modeling insurance claims data with excess zeros coming from heterogeneous sources . Additionally we give two expectationoptimization algorithms for parameter estimation given in the proposed models . An appropriate simulation study shows that for various settings and in contrast to the existing mixture based approaches both extended models perform well . Finally a real data set based on French auto mobile policies is used to illustrate the application of the proposed extensions .

@highlight We extend the class of generalized linear mixture CWM models to ZI GCWM models by proposing the methodology that allows for continuous covariates to follow a non Gaussian distribution and additionally we develop a new CWM methodology that uses BernoulliPoisson partitioning method and allows for implementation of zero inflated CWM.
@highlight We offer a rigorous flexible and interpretable methodology to claims frequency and severity modeling in general insurance.
@highlight The proposed methodology is highly relevant to insurance pricing and risk management.
