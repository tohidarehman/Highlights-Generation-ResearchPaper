 This study examines global food trade from a nutritional perspective paying particular attention to its implications for food security in low income countries . By describing food trade in terms of the quantities of three essential macronutrients embedded in food the analysis goes beyond a simple description of trade values quantities or caloric content as is common in the literature . Furthermore the study provides estimates of the implicit price of each macronutrient their evolution over time and their implications in terms of North South food trade . The data show that over the 19962014 period the volume of macronutrients exchanged on international markets has more than doubled with carbohydrates accounting for over 60 of trade flows but proteins and lipids growing at a faster pace . Proteins were found to be the most expensive macronutrient followed by lipids and carbohydrates . In general macronutrients embedded in animal and processed products are more expensive than those in vegetal and unprocessed food . The results also suggest that the participation in international food trade has positive effects on low income countries aggregate food availability and food access two pillars of food security . Indeed low income countries register a net inflow of all macronutrients and take advantage of nutritional arbitrages available on international food markets due to macronutrients price differentials .

@highlight The quantity of macronutrients traded internationally has more than doubled since 1996.
@highlight Proteins are the most expensive macronutrient followed by lipids and carbohydrates.
@highlight International food trade enhances the availability of macronutrients in low income countries.
@highlight International food trade improves low income countries aggregate food access.
