 Reduction in health risks from household air pollution and ambient air pollution is critical for achieving sustainable development globally especially in low income countries . Children are at particularly high risk because their respiratory and immune systems are not fully developed . Previous studies have identified the adverse impacts of air pollution on child health . However most studies do not focus on HAP and AAP simultaneously nor address differences in the timings and magnitudes of prenatal and postnatal exposures across genders . Therefore this study examines how prenatal and postnatal exposures to ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5m or less PM

@highlight Solid fuels for cooking proxy for household air pollution is associated with respiratory illness in girls but not boys.
@highlight Prenatal exposure to ambient PM
@highlight correlates with stunting in boys but not girls.
@highlight Postnatal exposure to ambient PM
@highlight is associated with stunting in both genders.
@highlight Biological and social factors partly explain these contrasting results.
@highlight To reduce the adverse influences of air pollution on child health policies should prioritize girls and pregnant women.
