 Provision of government contract information in English reduces the barriers to participation by foreign suppliers . We measure this effect using data from the country of Georgia where English translations of government tenders were provided above specified contract size thresholds which varied over time and across contract types . The provision of English documentation more than doubles foreign company participation for low value contracts and leads to smaller though still substantial increases for higher value contracts . Because foreign bidder participation in Georgia is relatively small the resulting impact on prices is in the order of only one percent .

@highlight Providing contract documentation in English greatly increases the participation of foreign firms in government procurement contracts.
@highlight Foreign bidder entry seems to selective towards contract competitions with weaker competition from domestic firms.
@highlight Because foreign suppliers are a small fraction of the Georgian market changes in their participation rates have very small effects on prices.
