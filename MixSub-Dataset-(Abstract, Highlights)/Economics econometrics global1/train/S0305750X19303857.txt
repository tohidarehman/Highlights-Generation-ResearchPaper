 One of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all . Most research on impact of technology on learning outcomes depends on designs that require low student to computer ratio and extensive retraining of teachers . These requirements make the designs difficult to implement on a large scale and hence are limited in terms of inclusivity and ability to provide equitable opportunity for all . Our paper is the first to evaluate an intervention design that is aimed at dealing with these concerns . We conduct a large scale randomised field experiment in 1823 rural government schools in India that uses technology aided teaching to replace one third of traditional classroom teaching . Even with high student to computer ratios and minimal teacher training we observe a positive impact on student learning outcomes . The study thus presents a low cost resource light design which can be implemented in a developing country on a large scale to address the problem of poor learning outcomes thereby making the intervention inclusive and equitable in line with the spirit of SDG 4 .

@highlight We evaluate impact of a large scale intervention using technology aided teaching in 1823 rural government schools in India.
@highlight We use a resource light design that requires one computer and projector per school and minimal teacher retraining.
@highlight We observe positive impact on student learning outcomes in the subjects for which the intervention was conducted.
@highlight Being a resource light design it can be helpful in achieving the objective of SDG 4.
