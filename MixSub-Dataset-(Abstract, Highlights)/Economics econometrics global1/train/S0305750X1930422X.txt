 We review all eight randomized control trial studies of microfinance published in peer reviewed journals . The studies generally show no or minimal impact from providing microloans to clients and have led many researchers and policy makers to conclude that microfinance has been proven to have little or no positive impacts on peoples lives . We review these studies in detail and find four main results . First we are able to replicate the results using the researchers original data . Second we observe that while the results are generally insignificant at traditional levels most estimated coefficients are large . Third every one of the studies is underpowered to detect reasonable effect sizes often due to low take up of the financial product offered . Pooling the data from the studies together improves power for most outcomes but minimum detectable effect sizes are still large . Finally when we run analysis on a pooled sample we find a treatment effect on business profits business revenue and household assets significant at the 1 level . We argue that existing research on the impact of microfinance is generally underpowered to identify impacts reliably and suggests that we still know very little about the impact of microfinance . We end by discussing ways to improve future research .

@highlight Studies of microfinance generally show no or minimal impact from providing microloans.
@highlight We replicate all RCTs on microfinance and find that results are insignificant though most coefficients are large.
@highlight Every one of the studies is significantly underpowered to detect reasonable effect sizes.
@highlight Analysis on a pooled sample shows treatment effects of 28 to 40 increase in profits significant at the 1 level.
@highlight This suggests that we still know very little about the impact of microfinance.
