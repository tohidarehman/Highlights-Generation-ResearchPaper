 How do natural disasters influence social conflict We build on previous research by drawing more attention to conditional effects . We argue that damage and destruction tend to increase local level cooperation and cohesion as common threats and challenges supersede pre existing communal cleavages . Irregular distribution of reconstruction aid in the presence of pre existing social inequalities however can dampen these effects and foster social conflict . We test this argument with a village level analysis of the effects of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal we rely on data on the exogenous spatial distribution of earthquake intensity the number of violent events and the patterns of post disaster aid distribution . Our findings show that villages exposed to the earthquake experienced a reduction in the number of social conflict events . This pacifying effect is mediated by government aid distribution as more aid is distributed the conflict mitigating effects of the earthquake are weakened . These results highlight the need for more conflict sensitive reconstruction aid in the aftermath of natural disasters .
