 Studies of firm bribery have not fully examined how market competition conditions the effects of social norms on firms bribe payments . We suggest that firms pay bribes to obtain abnormal rents and or to conform to accepted rules of corruption . These motivations operate differently depending on the level of market competition . Using data from an annual survey of 10 000 Vietnamese firms between 2006 and 2017 we find that in environments characterized by open competition bribery is positively associated with long standing norms in the business social context while in closed competition environments bribe payments are functions of rents that accrue from uncertainty in policy making .

@highlight We synthesize rent seeking and norm based explanations of firm bribery.
@highlight In open markets with easy business entry non collusive coercive forms of bribery prevail.
@highlight In restricted markets due to formal or informal entry barriers rent seeking leads to collusive bribery.
@highlight Uncertainty increases the benefits of rent seeking in restricted environments.
@highlight Hypotheses are tested on 11years of survey data of 10 000 businesses in 63 Vietnamese provinces.
