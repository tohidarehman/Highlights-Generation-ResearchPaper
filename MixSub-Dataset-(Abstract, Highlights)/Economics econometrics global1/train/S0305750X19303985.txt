 The Sustainable Development Goals call upon all countries to achieve 17 broad development goals by 2030 . The SDGs are a central component of many national development plans and foreign aid strategies . While the SDGs have become a central aspect of development planning how achievable are they under present conditions This paper explores a dynamic middle of the road baseline global development scenario using an integrated assessment model to evaluate progress toward target values on nine indicators related to six human development SDGs . We find that between 2015 and 30 the world will make only limited progress towards achieving those SDGs with our current set of policy priorities . Our study finds that across the variables explored here 43 percent had already reached target values by 2015 . By 2030 target values are projected to be achieved for 53 percent of country variables . This paper highlights special difficulty in achieving targets on some SDG indicators representing persistent development issues that will not be solved without a significant shift in domestic and international aid policies and prioritization . In addition we highlight 28 particularly vulnerable countries that are not projected to achieve any of the nine human development related target values in a middle of the road scenario . These most vulnerable countries must be the focus of international assistance .

@highlight The world is not on track to achieve many human development related Sustainable Development Goals.
@highlight Some targets are especially challenging access to safe sanitation upper secondary school completion and underweight children.
@highlight Twenty eight most vulnerable countries MVCs are projected to not achieve any of the selected human development SDG targets explored here.
@highlight Population in MVCs is projected to grow from 751million in 2015 to 1721 million by 2050.
@highlight Globally nearly 1 in 4 youths are projected to live in an MVC by 2030.
