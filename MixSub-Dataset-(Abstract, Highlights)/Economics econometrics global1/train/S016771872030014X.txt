 This paper studies the incentives to engage in exclusionary pricing in the context of two sided markets . Platforms are horizontally differentiated and seek to attract users of two groups who single home and enjoy indirect network externalities from the size of the opposite user group active on the same platform . The entrant incurs a fixed cost of entry and the incumbent can commit to its prices before the entry decision is taken . The incumbent has thus the option to either accommodate entry or to exclude entry and enjoy monopolistic profits albeit under the constraint that its price must be low enough to not leave any room for an entrant to cover its fixed cost of entry . We find that in the spirit of the literature on limit pricing under certain circumstances even platforms find it profitable to exclude entrants if the fixed entry cost lies above a certain threshold . By studying the properties of the threshold we show that the stronger the network externality the lower the thresholds for which incumbent platforms find it profitable to exclude . We also find that entry deterrence is more likely to harm consumers the weaker are network externalities and the more differentiated are the two platforms .

@highlight We consider a two sided platform market where an incumbent can either accommodate entry or exclude entry with a limit pricing strategy.
@highlight We discuss the circumstances when the incumbent platform finds it profitable to exclude entrants that have to pay an entry fixed cost.
@highlight We show that the stronger the network externality the lower the fixed cost entry thresholds for which incumbent platforms wants to exclude.
@highlight Entry deterrence is more likely to harm consumers the weaker are network externalities and the more differentiated are the two platforms.
@highlight The paper reaches the conclusion that the presence of network externalities does not make platforms less prone to embracing exclusionary conduct.
