 Psychology and neuroscience studies document that facial trustworthiness perceptions may affect observers decision making process . Our study examines whether auditors perceptions of client executives facial trustworthiness are associated with their audit fee decisions . We employ a machine learning based face detection algorithm to measure executives facial trustworthiness . We find that auditors charge 5.6 less audit fee to firms with trustworthy looking CFOs than to those with untrustworthy looking CFOs in initial audit engagements . Auditor tenure weakens the negative association between CFOs facial trustworthiness and audit fee . Further evidence shows that CFO s facial trustworthiness is associated with neither financial reporting quality nor litigation risk .

@highlight Our study finds that auditors charge lower audit fees to firms with trustworthy looking CFOs than to those with untrustworthy looking CFOs in initial audit engagements. Our results also suggest that audit tenure weakens the negative association between CFO facial trustworthiness and audit fee.
@highlight Our study develops a novel methodology to measure facial trustworthiness using recent image processing techniques enabling us to provide systematic evidence on auditors use of facial trustworthiness using a large sample.
