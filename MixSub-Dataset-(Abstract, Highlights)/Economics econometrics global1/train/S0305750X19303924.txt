 Since the 1970s Community forestry initiatives have sought to combine sustainable forestry community participation and poverty alleviation . Like other community based forms of natural resource management CF has been lauded for its potential to involve local people in conservation while opening new opportunities for economic development . However CF programmes are not always successful economically or ecologically and by devolving new powers and responsibilities to an abstractly defined community they risk exacerbating existing patterns of social exclusion and creating new conflicts . In this paper we mobilise a relational concept of negotiation within a political ecology framework to explore how the power relations of CF are addressed and transformed in a region where issues of conflict and tenure security have long shaped the social forest . Specifically we focus on the emergence and consolidation of ACOFOP

@highlight We explore the cross scalar negotiation of power relations of community forestry.
@highlight Forest Based Associations such as ACOFOP have been critical to long term successes.
@highlight Through qualitative analysis we study the adaptation of ACOFOPs model through time.
@highlight In our case community forestry has been modified to address politics of access conflict and tenure.
@highlight Adaptive learning has centred on participatory decision making conflict resolution advocacy and capacity building.
