 This study examines the effect of smallholder farmers access to a formal climate risk transfer mechanism on their risk preferences . Survey and experimental data were collected from smallholder farmers that have access to weather index based crop insurance in Ethiopia . We use an endogenous switching probit model to address self selection and simultaneity biases . Results from the ESP model show that farmers who purchased WICI are less likely to be risk averse compared with the counterfactual scenario of being non purchaser farmers . Similarly non purchasers would have attained a significant reduction in their risk aversion if they had taken up the insurance product . We also find that WICI has a positive and statistically significant effect on farmers real life risk taking behavior as exemplified by mineral fertilizer use . The implication of our findings is that formal climate risk transfer mechanisms can positively influence rural household farm investment decisions by reducing individual risk aversion . Therefore they can possibly contribute to poverty alleviation and economic development within agrarian economies that are exposed to recurrent and severe climate shocks .

@highlight We examine the impact of weather index based crop insurance WICI on farmers risk preferences.
@highlight We use an endogenous switching probit model to address self selection and simultaneity biases.
@highlight Promoting WICI increases farmers uptake of the insurance product.
@highlight WICI uptake reduces farmers risk aversion and in turn increases agricultural technology adoption.
@highlight Formal climate risk transfer mechanisms can bring about desirable economic behaviour.
