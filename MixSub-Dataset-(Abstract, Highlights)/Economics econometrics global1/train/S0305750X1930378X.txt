 Aid allocation within countries is often thought of as a strategic action by the incumbent leaders to further their own goals . Theoretically however the effects of aid may be either positive or negative and the empirical evidence is limited . By matching geo coded data on aid projects to 101 792 respondents in five waves of the Afrobarometer we investigate the effects of aid on incumbency support using project fixed effects . We estimate the effects for World Bank aid and Chinese aid separately and find positive effects for the former and no robust effect for the latter . For neither project donor do we find effects on turnout and that aid is not targeting areas with previously higher incumbency support . We find little support for the notion that economic voting is driving the result as individuals self perceived economic conditions are not affected . The positive effects for the World Bank aid projects seem to be mediated by trust in the politicians whereas we find no effects of Chinese aid on trust .
