 This paper focuses on local conflicts over marine conservation in southeastern Tanzania . It draws from ethnographic fieldwork conducted in 2014 and 2015 in a coastal village located inside the boundaries of a marine park . The paper first examines why villagers have come to contest the park and subsequently outlines the various forms of resistance they employ to mobilize their opposition . Some people are willing to protest openly as evidenced by the destruction of the park s gatehouse office and directory signs in 2013 . However an immediate violent response to such acts from state paramilitary forces has instilled fear in villagers . The swift crackdown coupled with ongoing surveillance from ranger patrols has engendered a degree of discipline in some people . Rather than risking further repercussions many villagers engage in everyday forms of resistance through subtle acts of noncompliance to the conservation regulations . These practices are entangled with material benefits and moral statements about customary rights to resources . They may also facilitate political mobility by destabilizing conservation management while simultaneously avoiding open confrontation with governing authorities . I refer to this overall process as the making of marine park subjects .
