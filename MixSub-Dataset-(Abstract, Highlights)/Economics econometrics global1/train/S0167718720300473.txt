 The reference effect and loss aversion are incorporated into the buyers utility in the symmetric independent private value models of sealed bid auctions . The buyers equilibrium bidding strategy and the sellers optimal reserve price are derived for the first price and second price sealed bid auctions . In both auction mechanisms the sellers optimal reserve price and expected revenue are increasing in the reference point . We compare the sellers expected revenues as well as the optimal reserve prices in the two auctions . The results show that the seller will set a higher optimal reserve price but obtain lower optimal expected revenue in the second price auction compared to the first price auction . Further we extend the model to the gain seeking case and endogenize the reference point as the ex ante expected price of the item in equilibrium . In contrast to the loss averse case the seller will set a lower optimal reserve price but obtain higher optimal expected revenue in the second price auction compared to the first price auction if the buyers are gain seeking . With an endogenous reference point similar results are obtained in terms of revenue comparison between the two auctions .
