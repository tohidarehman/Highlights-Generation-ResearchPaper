 We provide an overview and synthesis of recent work on models of monopolistic competition with heterogeneous firms in international trade paying particular attention to competition effects pass through selection effects and linking distributions of firm characteristics and outcomes . A recurring theme is that CES preferences are extremely convenient for deriving analytic results but also extremely restrictive in their theoretical and empirical implications . We introduce the class of constant response demand functions to describe some related families of demand functions that provide a unifying principle for much recent work that explores alternatives to CES demands .
