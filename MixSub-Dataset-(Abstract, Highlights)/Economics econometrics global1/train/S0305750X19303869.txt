 This paper examines the public sector wage premium using nationally representative household surveys from up to 68 countries . Compared to all private sector paid employees including informal sector employees the public sector generally pays a wage premium . However in most countries the wage premium disappears when the public sector is compared to only formal sector private employees although there is heterogeneity across skill levels . Premiums tend to be lowest for high skilled public sector employees who in several countries pay a penalty for working in the public sector . On the other hand the public sector premium tends to be higher for employees with less education those working in lower paid occupations and those working in low skilled occupations . This pattern is consistent with wage compression in the public sector . Across countries the wage premium is only weakly associated with countries level of development . These findings challenge the existing consensus that public sector workers tend to enjoy a significant wage premium over their private sector counterparts and that this premium is especially large in low income countries .

@highlight Public sector workers in a large sample of countries are generally not paid a premium over formal workers in the private sector.
@highlight Low skilled workers tend to earn public sector wage premiums while educated professionals are likely to pay public sector wage penalties.
@highlight The estimated public sector wage premium is weakly associated with countries level of development.
