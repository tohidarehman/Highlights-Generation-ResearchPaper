 The degree to which firms delegate authority to non managerial and non supervisory workers varies substantially across countries and industries . By examining worker level data from 14 countries I empirically explain this variation by region specific social capital that proxies workers degree of self centeredness and the industry specific need for coordination . The empirical results provide the first confirmation of Alonso et al . s theoretical predictions In particular when self centeredness of workers is very low the degree of delegation is always high regardless of the need for coordination . Consistent with the theory as coordination becomes important better horizontal communication among co workers occurs to sustain the same delegation level .

@highlight This study is the first to empirically confirm Alonso etal.s model on delegation.
@highlight Non managerial and non supervisory workers data from 14 countries are used.
@highlight Region specific social capital is used to represent workers self centeredness.
@highlight The degree of delegation is always high in regions with very high social capital.
@highlight This is true regardless of the level of industry s need for coordination.
