While estimating the effects of three alternative measures of monetary policy on banks credit supply we include several bank specific and macroeconomic variables in the specification as control variables . We provide strong evidence on the existence of the credit channel of monetary policy transmission mechanism in Malaysia . Yet we show that Islamic banks respond considerably less to changes in monetary policy instruments as compared to their conventional counterparts . We also find that the monetary policy measures affect small sized banks and less liquid banks more as compared to large sized and more liquid banks . Our findings suggest that for an effective monetary policy there is a vital need to consider the nature of Islamic banking while devising any monetary policy instruments to manage credit supply in the economy .
