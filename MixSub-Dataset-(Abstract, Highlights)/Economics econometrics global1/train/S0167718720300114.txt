 We analyze by means of a formal economic model the use of the discount attribution test to assess the competitive effects of loyalty discounts . In the model a dominant firm enjoys a competitive advantage over its rivals and uses market share discounts to boost the demand for its own products . In this framework we show that the attribution test is misleading or at best completely uninformative . Our results cast doubts on the applicability of price cost tests to loyalty discount cases .

@highlight In the model market share discounts may be pro or anti competitive depending on the circumstances.
