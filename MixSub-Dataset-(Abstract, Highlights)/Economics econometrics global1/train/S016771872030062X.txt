 We explore how pricing dynamics in the European airline industry vary with the competitive environment and with customer heterogeneity . We document three main findings . First the rate at which prices increase towards the scheduled departure date is significantly reduced in more competitive markets . Second the sensitivity of the intertemporal slope to competition increases in the heterogeneity of the customer base . Third ex ante predictable advance purchase discounts account for 83 percent of within flight dispersion in prices and for 17 percent of cross market variation in pricing dynamics .
