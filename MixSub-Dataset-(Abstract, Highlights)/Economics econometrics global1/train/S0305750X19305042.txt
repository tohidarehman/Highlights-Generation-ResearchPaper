 Trans boundary water governance is crucial for addressing water related issues caused by a growing population in combination with increasing demand human intervention conflict and above all climate change impacts on water resources . A literature review demonstrates that there is indeed a positive relationship between governance and the mitigation of tensions and meeting of sustainability goals in a given basin . Understanding the impacts of trans boundary water governance from a sustainability perspective is very important . In this paper Gibsons Sustainability Criteria are used to assess the sustainability performance of the trans boundary water governance in the Great Lakes basin . The findings reveal that the trans boundary water governance in this region is particularly weak in addressing Gibsons Sustainability Criteria factors of

@highlight There are many successes in meeting water related sustainability criteria in the Great Lakes basin via trans boundary water governance.
@highlight Trans boundary water governance should more specifically address ecosystem resilience inter generational equity long term adaptation.
@highlight This study may provide the basis to formulate upgrade or coordinate existing and future trans boundary water governance around the globe.
