 While environmental conservation is sometimes criticized for limiting the sources of income for the poorest populations tourism in protected areas is often viewed in the literature as a mechanism that helps to increase local welfare and reduce poverty in developing countries . However there are still few quantitative studies assessing how nature based tourism is directly linked with welfare . In this article we examine the relationships between tourism and the monetary welfare of local populations in Nepals protected areas and self reporting being constrained in the use of natural resources and the welfare of the same population . We develop a two level hierarchical linear model to take into account the database structure . We estimate that households involved in a self employed occupation directly linked to tourism are associated with a significantly higher consumption compared with non involved households . In addition results suggest that tourism may generate positive externalities on the communitys welfare . We conclude that tourism development in Nepals protected areas should be included in a broader sustainable development agenda .

@highlight Self employment in tourism is positively related to household welfare in Nepals protected areas.
@highlight The relationship between tourism and local welfare varies according to geographical location.
@highlight Self reporting being constrained in the use of natural resources is not significantly linked to household welfare in the protected areas under study.
