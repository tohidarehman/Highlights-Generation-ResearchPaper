 Theoretically if firms face a regulatory per customer quantity limit they should have an incentive to discriminatively charge high demand customers higher prices and make them just willing to buy a quantity equal to the limit . In the U.S. residential mortgage industry mortgages with origination balances above the conforming loan limits can not be guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises which make lenders face a per customer quantity limit . This paper finds that borrowers bunching at the limit pay higher interest rates due to price discrimination . This study rules out the alternative explanation that those borrowers are of higher risk than other borrowers .

@highlight The conforming loan limit policy has a side effect.
@highlight It enables lenders to engage in price discrimination.
@highlight The intrinsic demand of borrowers bunching at the limit is higher than the limit.
@highlight Thus they are charged a higher interest rate due to price discrimination by lenders.
