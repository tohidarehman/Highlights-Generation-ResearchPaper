 Despite its relevance for policy there is limited evidence on the impact of lowering school entry age and increasing the length of primary education on student performance . This study examines these changes in the context of Brazils 2006 compulsory schooling reform . We exploit differences in the years that schools adopted the policy as a plausibly exogenous source of variation and use students birth months to predict school entry age . The overall impact of the policy package was to increase math and Portuguese test scores by approximately 0.11 and 0.06 standard deviations in students fifth and ninth year of school . Among the students who entered primary school one year earlier those without any prior education experienced larger increases in their fifth year test scores compared to students who gained an additional year of primary education at the expense of preschool . This advantage however became smaller by their ninth year . We discuss different mechanisms through which the policy may have influenced student performance and conduct various robustness checks that lend support to the papers interpretation .

@highlight We investigate the impact of Brazils 2006 school reform that lowered entry age and increased the length of primary education.
@highlight The policy reform increased math and Portuguese test scores by approximately 0.11 standard deviations in students fifth year of school.
@highlight The impact of the reform diminished over time with test scores increasing by about 0.06 standard deviations in the ninth year of school.
@highlight The impact of age at test which rose for some students exerted a stronger influence than school entry age which fell for some students.
@highlight The short and medium run effects differed for students with and without pre school.
