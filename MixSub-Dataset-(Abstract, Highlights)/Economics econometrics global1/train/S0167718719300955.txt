 We show that the incentive to engage in exclusionary tying may arise even when tying can not be used as a defensive strategy to protect the incumbents dominant position in the primary market . By engaging in tying an incumbent firm sacrifices current profits but can exclude a more efficient rival from a complementary market by depriving it of the critical scale it needs to be successful . In turn exclusion in the complementary market allows the incumbent to be in a favorable position when a more efficient rival will enter the primary market and to appropriate some of the rivals efficiency rents . The paper also shows that tying is a more profitable exclusionary strategy than pure bundling and that exclusion is the less likely the higher the proportion of consumers who multi home .
