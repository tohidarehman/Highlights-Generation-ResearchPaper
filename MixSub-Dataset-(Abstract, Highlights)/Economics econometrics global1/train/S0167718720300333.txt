 Branded drug manufacturers issue copay coupons to compete with generics as their brands are coming off patent . To explore the impact of copay coupons on pricing and welfare I estimate a model of demand and supply using data on sales advertising and copayment for cholesterol lowering drugs and perform a counterfactual analysis to simulate equilibrium pricing with copay coupons used for price discrimination and moral hazard . Copay coupons issued for price discrimination make the drug with coupons affordable for more consumers and increase consumer welfare even when a small fraction of consumers receive a coupon . Coupons used for moral hazard significantly mitigate price competition and improve consumer welfare only when coupon penetration is sufficiently high .
