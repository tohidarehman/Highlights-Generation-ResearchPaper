 I analyse a market with asymmetric information and interdependent values . Accessing the market is costly and stochastic e.g . requires lobbying licences or R D. For a range of parameter values interventions that raise production or entry costs for all seller types increase trade investment and payoff for all types . This effect is driven by a novel feedback loop between the market composition and the investment in access .

@highlight In an adverse selection market with endogenous entry higher production costs increase trade investment and payoff for all types.
