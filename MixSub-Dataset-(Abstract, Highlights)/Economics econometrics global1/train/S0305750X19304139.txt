 Large segments of the population in developing countries especially in rural areas have a high level of vulnerability to weather related shocks but have limited means to insure themselves against them . In recent years microfinance institutions have experimented with micro insurance products including rainfall index insurance but the uptake of these products has generally been very low . We present findings from a pilot study exploring whether and how existing ties between urban migrants and rural farmers may be used to provide the latter improved access to formal insurance . Urban migrants in Ouagadougou originating from nearby villages were offered at the prevailing market price a rainfall index insurance product that can potentially protect their rural relatives from adverse weather shocks . The product had an uptake of 22 during the two week subscription window . Half the urban migrants in the study were randomly offered an insurance policy in which payouts would be made not to the subscriber but directly to the intended beneficiary . This feature increased uptake rates by 1722 percentage points . We argue that rainfall index insurance can complement informal risk sharing networks by mitigating problems of informational asymmetry and self control issues .

@highlight Migrants in Ouagadougou were offered a rainfall index insurance product that can protect their rural relatives from adverse shocks.
@highlight The study recorded an uptake rate of 22 among the urban migrants over the two week period of the trial.
@highlight The cost per subscription during the pilot was 3850 lower than the current cost of marketing weather index insurance in rural areas.
@highlight Uptake was higher by 1722 points if the policy specified insurance payouts directly to the rural relative rather than the migrant.
