 We document that earnings acceleration defined as the quarter over quarter change in earnings growth has significant explanatory power for future excess returns . These excess returns are robust to a wide range of previously documented anomalies and a battery of risk controls . The future return predictability appears to be consistent with investors assuming a seasonal random walk model for quarterly earnings and missing predictable implications of earnings acceleration for future earnings growth . Finally the excess returns from the basic earnings acceleration strategy can be enhanced further by focusing on profit firms low earnings volatility firms and on specific patterns of earnings acceleration .
