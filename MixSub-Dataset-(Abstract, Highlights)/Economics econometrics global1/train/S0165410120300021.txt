 We study how friendly boards design the structure of optimal compensation contracts in favor of powerful CEOs . Our study yields unexpected results . First powerful managers receive higher pay and a contract with a higher pay performance sensitivity if firm performance is low and vice versa . Moreover we identify conditions where expected pay and expected PPS are both increasing in the friendliness of the board . Second we show that friendly boards provide managers with higher salaries more shares but less options . Third friendly boards offering contracts with a higher PPS also make more intensive use of relative performance evaluation . Overall our results suggest that frequently used indicators of poor compensation practices should be interpreted with care . Extending the scope of our model beyond executive pay we show that powerful managers underinvest in capital but have less incentives to manage earnings .
