 We study the optimal reinsurance investment problem for the compound dynamic contagion process introduced by Dassios and Zhao . This model allows for self exciting and externally exciting clustering effect for the claim arrivals and includes the well known Cox process with shot noise intensity and the Hawkes process as special cases . For tractability we assume that the insurers risk preference is the time consistent meanvariance criterion . By utilizing the dynamic programming and extended HJB equation approach a closed form expression is obtained for the equilibrium reinsurance investment strategy . An excess of loss reinsurance type is shown to be optimal even in the presence of self exciting and externally exciting contagion claims and the strategy depends on both the claim size and claim arrivals assumptions . Further we show that the self exciting effect is of a more dangerous nature than the externally exciting effect as the former requires more risk management controls than the latter . In addition we find that the reinsurance strategy does not always become more conservative when the claim arrivals are contagious . Indeed the insurer can be better off retaining more risk if the claim severity is relatively light tailed .

@highlight Self exciting and externally exciting effect of claim arrivals are considered.
@highlight Closed form mean variance reinsurance investment strategies are derived.
@highlight Excess of loss type of reinsurance is optimal.
@highlight The self exciting effect is more dangerous than the externally exciting effect.
@highlight The insurer can be better off retaining more risk if the claim size is light tailed.
