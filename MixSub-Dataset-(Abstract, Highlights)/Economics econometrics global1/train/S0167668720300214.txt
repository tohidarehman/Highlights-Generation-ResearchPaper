 can be seen as a risk of a financial loss due to breach of an institutions IT infrastructure by unauthorized parties and exploiting taking possession of or disclosing data assets thus creating financial and or reputation damage . In this paper as a primary contribution to the existing body of actuarial literature we propose a structural model of aggregate loss distribution for cyber risk of small and medium sized enterprises under the assumption of a tree based LAN topology . Up to our knowledge there exist no theoretical models of an aggregate loss distribution for cyber risk in this setting . To achieve our goal we contextualize the problem in the probabilistic graph theoretical framework using percolation models . We assume that the IT network topology is represented by a random graph allowing for heterogeneous loss topology and providing instructive numerical examples .

@highlight To our knowledge we introduce the first structural model of aggregate loss distribution for cyber risk of small and medium sized enterprises.
@highlight We assume a random tree based LAN topology.
@highlight Our results show a robust pricing mechanism for cyber risk which is an entirely novel contribution to actuarial literature and practice.
