 Motivated by a recent merger proposal in the French outdoor advertising market we develop a model in which firms are initially endowed with some advertising capacities and compete on two fronts . First firms compete to acquire additional advertising capacities on an upstream market a first stage modeled as a second price auction with externalities . Second those firms privately informed on their own costs use their capacities on the downstream market to supply advertisers whose demand is random a second stage modeled by means of mechanism design techniques . We study the linkages between the equilibrium outcomes on both markets . When a firm is endowed with more initial capacity through the acquisition of a competitor for instance whether it becomes more or less eager to acquire extra capacity on the upstream market depends a priori on fine details of the downstream market . Under reasonable choices of functional forms we demonstrate that a downstream merger does not create any bias in the upstream market towards the already dominant firm .

@highlight When a firm has more initial capacity through a merger it does not systematically become more aggressive on the upstream market for the acquisition of extra capacities.
@highlight Firms behavior on the upstream market depends on characteristics of the downstream market such as elasticity of demand and the distribution of demand shocks.
@highlight Impact on the upstream market of a merger between downstream competitors also depends on the degree of asymmetry between firms before the merger.
