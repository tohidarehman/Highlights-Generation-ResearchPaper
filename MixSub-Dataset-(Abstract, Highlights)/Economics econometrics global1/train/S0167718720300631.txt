 The objective of this study is to empirically assess whether the 2002 reform of the EU leniency program which brought the EU leniency policy much closer to the US policy has increased the European Commissions capability to destabilize cartels while making prosecution more efficient . More specifically relying on a difference in difference approach we estimate the impact of the 2002 reform on cartel duration fines before and after applying leniency reductions and duration of investigation . We find that the 2002 reform decreased cartel duration by about 87 percent but did not significantly affect the other outcome variables . Thus our findings seem to suggest that the 2002 reform has improved the cartel destabilizing effect of the EU leniency program without enhancing however its effectiveness in prosecuting cartels .

@highlight We study the effects of the 2002 reform of the European Leniency Program.

@highlight Our empirical analysis is based on a difference in difference approach.
@highlight The reform has significantly reduced cartel duration.
@highlight Neither the duration of investigations nor fines have been affected by the reform.
