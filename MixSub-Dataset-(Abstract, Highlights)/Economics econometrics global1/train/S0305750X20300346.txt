 We show that in the month prior to the 2003 Argentine presidential election the expenditures of an Argentine poverty relief program exhibit a partisan bias . Taking into consideration the number of potential recipients the counties that were ideologically against the incumbent received a disproportionately large amount of the spending . Hence instead of targeting swing or core districts as established in the distributive politics literature in Argentina the incumbent targeted opposition strongholds . To identify these effects and to classify districts into swing core and opposition ones we exploit the 2001 crises in Argentina . In particular we use the 2001 political discontent that led to 15 of blank and null votes to estimate swing districts . Finally we also show that this tactical spending had an electoral purpose . In counties where it was arguably cheaper to monitor the recipients voting behavior the spending was significantly larger . In return the clientelist exchange took place in districts with greater spending and monitoring . Thus the politicians incentives to design an appropriate poverty relief program may be at odds with their electoral motivation .

@highlight We test competing hypotheses on distributive politics swing core opposition with Argentine data from 2001 to 2003.
@highlight Exploiting the political and economic crises we use the allocation of a poverty relief program to show the political bias.
@highlight Opposition strongholds received a disproportionally larger share controlling for the number of potential recipients.
@highlight The clientelist purpose of spending is demonstrated. First counties with better monitoring obtained more resources.
@highlight Second counties with greater spending experienced greater turnout and greater vote shares for the incumbent.
