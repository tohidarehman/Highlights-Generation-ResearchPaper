 We examine the role of venture capital in small and medium sized enterprise loans through samples on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations in China . We find that VC backup can effectively improve SMEs access to bank loans especially short term loans at lower costs and loans without collateral . VC backed loans are also less likely to default and positively related to SMEs performance . Our findings further suggest that VC backup reduces the information asymmetry between banks and SMEs through both hard information of better quality financial statement and soft information of SMEs creditability . Evidenced by enhanced SME financing conditions and bank efficiency in loan allocation the combined debt equity financing scheme can be a meaningful new ingredient in the financial infrastructure of the largest emerging market .
