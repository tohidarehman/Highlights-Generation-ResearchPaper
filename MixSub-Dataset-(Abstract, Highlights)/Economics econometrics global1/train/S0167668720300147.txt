 Starting from a bivariate copula family this paper investigates the existence of a Markov process whose temporal dependence is modeled by the given copula family . Due to that the transition function plays a core role for constructing a Markov process a transition function should be defined from a copula family . For this purpose the modified partial Dini derivatives of a bivariate copula are defined and applied for defining transition probabilities and some properties of the modified partial Dini derivatives are proved . A necessary and sufficient condition for the family of the defined transition probabilities to be a transition function is provided . Given a bivariate copula family a sufficient condition for the existence of a Markov process is provided where the Markov process has a transition function generated by the modified partial Dini derivatives of the bivariate copula family and the temporal dependence of the Markov process is modeled by the given copula family . The resulting Markov process is named as the copula based Markov process . Moreover under some assumptions the consistency of the bivariate copula family under the
