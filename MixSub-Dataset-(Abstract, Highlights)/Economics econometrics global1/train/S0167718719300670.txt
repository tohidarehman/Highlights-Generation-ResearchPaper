 This paper evaluates current antitrust policy in light of our current understanding of how transaction costs influence the ability of firms and consumers to deal with market power . The paper shows how the failure to consider transaction costs can lead to erroneous policy decisions . Many models employed today make simplifying assumptions about transaction costs that can lead to biased results in analyzing vertical and horizontal issues . The increased ability to monitor the effect of promotional behavior should cause us to reexamine whether free riding justifications previously accepted as justifications for various vertical restrictions still hold . Nash bargaining and Nash in Nash models raise concerns about the simplified assumptions assumed in which supposedly high transaction costs restrict the choice and form of the assumed competitive alternatives . The increasing importance of two sided markets together with an understanding of transaction costs is needed to understand antitrust conduct in those markets . The recent

@highlight Ignoring transaction costs and non linear pricing can lead to erroneous antitrust decisions.
@highlight Some common free riding justifications for vertical restrictions may no longer apply given promotion monitoring improvements.
@highlight Nash equilibria and Nash in Nash models often make oversimplified assumptions about contract form biasing their findings.
@highlight The AMEX case likely will lead to confusion in applying antitrust doctrines to vaguely judicially defined two sided markets.
@highlight Granting consumers property rights in data without barring exclusive sales to one firm may not address antitrust concerns.
