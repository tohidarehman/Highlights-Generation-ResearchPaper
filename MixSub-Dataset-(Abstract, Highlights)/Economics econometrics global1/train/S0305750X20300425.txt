 Latin America is caught up in a vortex of social change produced by the complex and conflicting dynamics of capitalist development and the forces of resistance mobilized in or against this process . In this paper I propose to deconstruct and dissect these dynamics . First I reconstruct three cycles of development and resistance that mark the evolution of capitalism in the region . Second I review and briefly discuss the advance of resource seeking extractive capital in the development process . It is argued that this advance is the defining feature of what might be understood as the new geo economics of capital in the region . The methodology employed is a structural strategic analysis within a political economy theoretical framework . The study is intended as an empirical and theoretical contribution to the growing literature and debate surrounding an understanding of the contemporary dynamics of capitalist development in Latin America . At issue are the development and resistance dynamics of extractivism .

@highlight The development process in Latin America is dominated by the advance of resource seeking extractive capital.
@highlight The new geoeconomics of capital is reflected in the emergence of progressive cycle in Latin American politics.
@highlight The development dynamics of extractive capitalism have given rise to new forces of change and diverse forms of resistance.
@highlight On the extractive frontier resistance is taking the form not of a class struggle but rather of an eco territorial struggle.
