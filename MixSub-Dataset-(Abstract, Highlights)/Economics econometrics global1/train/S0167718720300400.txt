 An informed plaintiff can send a take it or leave it demand to an uninformed defendant with the threat of a lawsuit that may not be credible . In this context the well known perfect separating equilibrium in litigation bargaining game no longer exists and all perfect Bayesian equilibria with pre filing settlements exhibit a cutoff feature . These equilibria offer an explanation for the distinctive behaviors of Litigation PAEs who aggressively file lawsuits for settlements and Portfolio PAEs who obtain licensing revenues through pre filing settlements . Our comparative statics results lead to testable hypotheses regarding how litigation costs and the plaintiffs reputation affect the settlement amount before and after the cases are filed and the frequency of lawsuits from a given plaintiff .

@highlight This paper provides one of the first formal models that analyze bargaining before a lawsuit is filed.
@highlight The pre filing bargaining game has great value in understanding the behavior of patent assertion entities PAEs .
@highlight The pre filing context yields markedly different equilibria comparing to the well studied pre trial bargaining games and our model yields new theoretical insights.
@highlight The model suggests that proposed policies that are aimed at fending off litigation threats from PAEs such as lowering prospective defendants litigation costs may lower settlement amounts before and post filing but increase the frequency of litigation from PAEs.
