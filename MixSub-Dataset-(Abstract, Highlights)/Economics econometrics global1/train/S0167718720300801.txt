 I study affirmative action subcontracting regulations in a model where governments use auctions to repeatedly procure goods and services at the lowest possible price . Through using disadvantaged subcontractors prime contractors build relationships over time resulting in lower subcontracting costs in future periods . I find that regulation in the form of a minimum subcontracting requirement expands bidder asymmetries favoring prime contractors with stronger relationships over those with weaker ones . Simulations show that the manner in which relationships evolve determines not only the utilization of disadvantaged subcontractors but also the procurement costs attained under affirmative action .
