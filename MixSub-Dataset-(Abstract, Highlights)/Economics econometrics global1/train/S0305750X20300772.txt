 Making agriculture work for nutrition is a widespread belief . The evidence base on the positive impacts of agricultural interventions on nutrition however is scarce . This paper revisits the relationships between agriculture and child nutrition through the impacts of foreign aid earmarked to agriculture on the prevalence of child stunting using a sample of 90 developing countries observed between 2002 and 2014 . We find evidence for a moderate effect of agricultural aid on child stunting . Among agricultural aid we find that aid inflows supporting agricultural education research and services agricultural water and agricultural policy are effective towards child stunting reductions . Food aid is most effective at reducing child stunting . Last we find that agricultural and food aid inflows are particularly effective in conflict settings .

@highlight While food aid substantially reduces child stunting agricultural aid has a limited impact.
@highlight Aid supporting agricultural education research and services is most effective towards reducing child stunting.
@highlight Agriculture should remain a key component of food security strategies targeted at food insecure children.
@highlight Agricultural and food aid inflows are more effective in conflict settings.
