 Municipal solid waste management is a challenging issue in developing countries . An unclean neighborhood could have a significant negative impact on housing property values too as it may lead to numerous diseases in addition to diminished aesthetic value . This study examines the effects of municipal solid waste collection services at the neighborhood level on housing property values using the hedonic price model . We use a sub sample of nationally representative household survey data from urban areas as well as primary data collected from one of the metropolitan cities in Nepal . Our results suggest that city residents place a high price premium on cleaner neighborhoods and less on open drains . These numbers indicate that better waste management will bring high returns to home owners and also the municipality in cities where the tax base includes the assessed value of property .

@highlight Using the hedonic price method this paper measures the value of cleaner neighborhoods in a low income country.
@highlight Results suggest that city residents place a high price premium between 25 and 57 on houses in cleaner neighborhoods.
@highlight The presence of an open drain in a neighborhood is estimated to reduce housing prices by 11 .
@highlight The results provide an excellent rationale for why city administrators should place a high priority on municipal solid waste management.
