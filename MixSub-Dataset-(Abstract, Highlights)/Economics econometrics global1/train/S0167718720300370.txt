 This article demonstrates that entry deterrence can occur when downstream incumbents hold non controlling ownership shares of a supplier that does not price discriminate . Such backward ownership implies a rebate on the input price for the incumbents and a competitive disadvantage for downstream entrants . An industry can use non controlling ownership to change the pricing of a supplier in a way that appears to be accommodating but in fact deters entry . The supplier benefits from an obligation or a commitment to supply the customers under equal terms as this induces profitable sales of ownership stakes to incumbent downstream firms .
