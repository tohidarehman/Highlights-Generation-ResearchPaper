 The last decade has seen a significant global increase in immigration . This large growth has caused an increasing opposition to immigration in local populations in many parts of the world partly because of a commonly held belief that immigration increases crime . Using data from Chile spanning 10years from 2005 to 2015 we analyze the relationship between immigration and crime through a dynamic Spatial Durbin Model which accounts for the possible bias for omitted variables . As the spatial model is dynamic and based on panel data it is possible to identify direct and indirect effects on both the short and long term bases . Our results show that there is no statistical evidence to link an increase in the number of immigrants to a rise in the rate of any type of crime . If any we found a negative relationship between the number of immigrants and crime for only one out of the eight crime types analyzed .

@highlight We evaluate the hypothesis that immigration increases the crime rate using a spatial temporal econometric approach.
@highlight Based on our results we rejected our hypothesis.
@highlight We found a negative relationship between immigrants and crime for only one out of the eight crime types analyzed.
