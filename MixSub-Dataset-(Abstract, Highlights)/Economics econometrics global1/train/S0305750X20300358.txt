 We study the impact of Chinese aid on household welfare in Sub Saharan Africa by combining data on Chinese development projects with data from Demographic and Health Surveys . Using difference in differences estimations and a matching technique we analyze the effect of Chinese aid on three social development outcomes education and child health and nutrition . We find that Chinese aid projects improve education and child mortality in treatment areas but have no effects on child nutrition . A sectoral analysis further reveals that social sector projects successfully improve households health and education . Improvements in these outcomes may additionally be driven indirectly by a positive effect of Chinese aid on economic welfare in treatment areas . Regarding the distribution and scale of Chinese projects we find that our results hold for lower treatment intensity levels only suggesting a non linear effect of Chinese aid .
