 In this paper we examine the impact of capital regulation on bank risk and the moderating role of deposit insurance on the relationship between capital regulation and bank risk during both normal and crisis periods . Using an international sample of banks from 111 countries our results show that stringent capital regulation reduces bank default risk in general during normal growth period and this effect is not conditioned by the existence of explicit deposit insurance . Further stringent capital regulation in place during the pre crisis period reduces bank default risk during the crisis period and this effect is stronger for countries with explicit deposit insurance during the pre crisis period . These results have important policy implications to design the optimal bank regulations .

@highlight Stringent capital regulation SCR reduces bank risk during normal periods.
@highlight SCR in place during the pre crisis period results in higher chances of bank survival during the crisis.
@highlight Effect of capital regulation on bank risk is conditioned by explicit deposit insurance only in crisis period but not in normal period.
