 As empirical evidence on the impact of internationalization on firm performance remains unclear we revisit the question of whether foreign investments enhance firm value and firm performance . Using a panel sample of publicly listed firms in Japan during the 19902016 period we find that foreign investments are negatively associated with firm value . In addition foreign investments are negatively related to firm performance at short and long horizons . Furthermore foreign investments appear to reduce revenue growth but have no effect on firm efficiency suggesting that simply increasing foreign investments does not necessarily enhance revenue growth or firm efficiency .
