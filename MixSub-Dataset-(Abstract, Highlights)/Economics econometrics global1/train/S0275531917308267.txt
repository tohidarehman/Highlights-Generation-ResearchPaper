 This paper focuses on the determinants of the use of multiple banking relationships by SMEs . We exploit the results of an original survey conducted on a sample of French SMEs in December 2012 . We first provide evidence that access to multiple banking relationships is influenced by firms characteristics . We find that larger high performing and innovative firms are more likely to develop multiple banking relationships . More originally relying on the management literature we also highlight the explanatory power of trust from the perspective of the CEO when the CEO mistrusts the firms main bank the firm will be more likely to engage in multiple banking relationships .
