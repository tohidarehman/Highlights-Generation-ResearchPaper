 We examine the long run effects of infant mortality overall working age mortality and mortality in different working age groups on innovative activity using recently developed panel time series methods . Our main results are there is no significant long run effect of infant mortality on innovative activity the long run effect of overall working age mortality is negative but only weakly significant and while there are no significant long run effects of mortality in very young and older working age groups reductions in mortality in young and early middle working age groups lead to statistically significant long run increases in innovative output . We also investigate possible explanations for these findings .

@highlight We use panel data between 1884 and 2015 to examine the long run effects of mortality changes on innovative output.
@highlight Infant mortality has no significant long run effect on innovative activity.
@highlight There are no significant long run effects of mortality in very young and older working age groups on innovative output.
@highlight Reductions in mortality in young and early middle working age groups play a pivotal role in increasing innovative activity.
