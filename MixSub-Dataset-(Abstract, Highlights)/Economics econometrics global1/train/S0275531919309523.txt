 The environmental social and governance data provided in firms sustainability reports is often unaudited . If ESG information disclosed by firms is not reliable a firms greenwashing behavior can be a barrier to integrating ESG factors into investment decisions . In this paper we study mechanisms to lessen firms greenwashing behavior in ESG dimensions holistically . Firstly we identify greenwashers as firms which seem very transparent and reveal large quantities of ESG data but perform poorly in ESG aspects . By creating peer relative greenwashing scores for a cross country dataset comprised by 1925 large cap firms we measure the extent to which large cap firms engage in greenwashing . We find evidence that greenwashing behavior in ESG dimensions can be deterred by scrutiny from independent directors institutional investors influential public interests via a less corrupted country system and being cross listed . Our results suggest that the two firm level governance factors are most effective at attenuating firms misleading disclosure relating to ESG dimensions .
