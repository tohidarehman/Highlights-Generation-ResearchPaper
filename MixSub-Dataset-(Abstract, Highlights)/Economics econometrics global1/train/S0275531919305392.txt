 Despite the surge in corporate savings and heightened interest in understanding the reasons for this behaviour little is known about the forces behind this stylised phenomenon in emerging markets . Using a large sample of firms from nine African countries over the period 20012015 we posit and find that the propensity to save is higher in this context due to limited access to external finance . However when we examine the effects of innovation on corporate savings we find that the results are reversed as relative to Non R D firms R D firms save less of their operating cash flow . This is in stark contrast to the extant literature in advanced economies which shows that savings are essential to smoothen lumpy irreversible and risky investments in innovation . We find this is due to the reversal in firm specific factors with R D firms in this context being larger and more mature hence relying less on internal financing sources compared to young and less mature R D firms in advanced economies . We interpret our results as suggestive of the overarching influence of access to external finance as a major determinant of the propensity to save and deterrent to investing in innovation . Our finding helps explain the glut in innovation amongst small and young firms in emerging markets and calls for policies that promote innovation .

@highlight The propensity to save for R D firms in emerging economies is lower rather than higher which is contrary to the literature.
@highlight The low propensity to save is due to the concentration of innovation amongst larger and more mature firms in emerging markets that are likely to be unconstrained.
