 This paper aims to analyse the tail risk spillover between banks insurance companies and the shadow banking system in the Eurozone contest . These intra sectoral interdependencies between financial market participants have contributed to the spread of instability in the financial system . Therefore mapping these links is important for policy makers to provide supervisory tools and can be a key input into the design of macroprudential policies . For this purpose we adopt the Tail Event driven NETwork risk model . The TENET is a useful method to map the tail interconnection between the three sectors and to provide systemic risk measures that take into account the too big to fail and too big to interconnected concepts . The results suggest that each financial sector has a significant impact on the other . By comparing the contribution of each sector we show that banks are the largest emitters of risk . However also shadow banking firms are systemic important given their high level of connection . The work provides a clear view of risk spillovers and interconnection dynamics during the crisis providing a meaningful ranking of the systemic important financial institutions .
