 This paper explores the effect of market structure on quality determination for complementary products . The focus is on the airline industry and the effect of airline alliances on flight frequency an important element of service quality . With zero layover cost the choice of flight frequencies has the same double marginalization structure as in the usual alliance model leading to a higher frequency in the alliance case as double marginalization is eliminated along with a lower full trip price and higher traffic . The surprising result of the paper emerges with high cost layover time where double marginalization in frequencies is absent and where an alliance reduces service quality via a lower frequency with the full price potentially rising .

@highlight Little research exists on the effect of market structure on the provision of complementary goods.
@highlight Existing work says joint provision could raise or lower quality of such goods relative to independent provision.
@highlight Paper studies this question in the airline industry focusing on the effect of alliances on flight frequency a quality measure .
@highlight The answer depends on passenger attitudes toward layover time.
