 In the wake of climate change there is now a resurgence of interest in the promotion of crop diversification as a climate smart agricultural practice in Sub Saharan Africa . The development economics literature suggests that increasing crop diversity is an effective risk management and consumption smoothing strategy in a context characterized by repeated exposure to shocks but weak institutional innovations . Using panel survey data from rural Uganda merged with historical weather data this paper sheds light on the household welfare and consumption smoothing effects of crop diversity . We employ instrumental variables methods to control for unobserved heterogeneity and potential reverse causality . Our study finds that crop diversification is a welfare enhancing strategy that increases consumption and aggregate household diets . Instrumental variables quantile regression results show that crop diversification generates higher consumption benefits for poorest households in the lower quantile of the consumption distribution than for relatively richer households . Crop diversification also improves consumption smoothing through reducing households reliance on less effective strategies such as informal insurance and involuntary diet changes as risk coping mechanisms . Overall the findings suggest that transforming agriculture towards a more diversified cropping system is a viable pathway for improving diets welfare risk management and the resilience of rural households .

@highlight We study the welfare and risk coping effects of crop diversity in rural Uganda.
@highlight Crop diversification increases household diet diversity and consumption.
@highlight The effect on consumption is higher for relatively poor households.
@highlight Crop diversity reduces the need for informal insurance as risk coping strategy.
