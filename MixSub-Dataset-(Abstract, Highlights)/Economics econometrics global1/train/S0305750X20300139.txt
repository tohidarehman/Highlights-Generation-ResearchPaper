 The performance of the Simple Poverty Scorecard is compared against the performance of established regression based estimators . All estimates are benchmarked against observed poverty status based on household expenditure data from household socioeconomic surveys that span nearly a decade and are representative of subnational populations . When the models all adopt the same one size fits all training approach based on the national sample there is no meaningful difference in performance and the Simple Poverty Scorecard is as good as any of the regression based estimators . The one size fits all training approach based on the national sample results in overestimating poverty in the regions with lower poverty rates and underestimating poverty in the regions with higher poverty rates . In the poorest strata average SPS discrepancies are as high as 1525 percentage points . The findings change however when the regression based estimators are trained on training sets that more closely resemble potential subpopulation test sets . In this case regression based models outperform the nationally calculated Simple Poverty Scorecard in terms of bias and variance . These findings highlight the fundamental trade off between simplicity of use and accuracy .

@highlight The performance of the Simple Poverty Scorecard SPS is compared to that of established regression based estimators.
@highlight The SPS is as good as any of the regression based estimators when the population of interest has a poverty rate near the national poverty rate.
@highlight The SPS overestimates poverty in the wealthier regions and underestimates poverty in the poorer regions.
@highlight In populations of interest in poorer regions regression based estimators tailored at the regional level perform better than the national SPS.
@highlight These findings highlight the fundamental trade off between simplicity of use and accuracy.
