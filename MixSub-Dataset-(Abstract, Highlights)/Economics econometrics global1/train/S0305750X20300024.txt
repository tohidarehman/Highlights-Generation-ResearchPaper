 The Kenya Cash Transfer Programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children presents a valuable opportunity to examine the effects of imposing monetary penalties for noncompliance with conditions in cash transfer programs in contrast to providing only guidance for cash transfer use . We take advantage of random assignment to a conditional arm within the CT OVC treatment locations to understand the impact of imposing conditions with penalties on program beneficiaries as well as how this effect varies by household wealth . Program beneficiaries were expected to visit health facilities for immunizations growth monitoring and nutrition supplements and to enroll in and attend school . We find little difference in program outcomes between households in the conditional treatment arm compared to those in the treatment arm with labeling only . However among the poorest CT OVC beneficiaries assignment to the conditional arm was associated with penalty fines and a significant decrease in non food consumption . This suggests that in comparison to labeled cash transfers conditional cash transfers may produce unintended regressive policy effects for the most vulnerable participants .

@highlight We compare a conditional cash transfer program arm to a labeled arm that provides only guidance for spending the transfer.
@highlight About one third of households in the conditional CCT arm received a penalty fine for noncompliance.
@highlight We find little difference in program outcomes between households in the CCT and labeled LCT program arms.
@highlight Among the poorest households assignment to the CCT arm was associated with a significant decrease in non food consumption.
@highlight Compared to LCTs CCTs may produce unintended regressive policy effects for the most vulnerable participants.
