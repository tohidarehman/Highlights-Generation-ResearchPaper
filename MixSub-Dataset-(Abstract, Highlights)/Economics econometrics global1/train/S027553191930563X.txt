 We analyse the drivers of hedge fund performance focusing simultaneously on fund size age lockup period fund strategies business cycles and different market conditions dealing with the omitted variable bias . We use exogenous break points and a switching Markov model to endogenously determine different market conditions . We find that HFs deliver positive alpha only during good times irrespective of their fundamentals . During bad times they minimise their systematic risk . Small and young funds and those with redemption restrictions deliver higher alpha compared to their peers during good times . Finally specific strategies deliver significantly negative alpha during bad times .
