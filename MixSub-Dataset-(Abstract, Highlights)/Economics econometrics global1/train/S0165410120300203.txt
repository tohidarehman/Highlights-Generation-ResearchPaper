 This study examines how PCAOB international inspections of non U.S. auditors affect international Merger and Acquisition outcomes . We find that clients of inspected auditors are more likely to become acquisition targets after the public disclosure of auditor s inspection report . We also find that deal completion is more likely and deal announcement returns are higher if deals involve targets with auditors for which inspection reports are available . Engagement deficiencies and unremediated quality control deficiencies identified in inspection reports weaken the positive effect of PCAOB oversight on M A outcomes . Collectively our results suggest that PCAOB oversight reduces information uncertainty in M A deals .
