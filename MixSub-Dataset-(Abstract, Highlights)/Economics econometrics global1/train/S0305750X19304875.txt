 Garrison and Souleyrette II elaborated a companion innovation hypothesis which says that improvements in transportation energize innovation in other sectors by creating opportunities to accomplish old things well or do something new . However existing literature provides limited direct evidence on this hypothesis . The fast rollout of high speed rail in China is explored as a natural experiment to test the hypothesis by matching it with three waves of innovation surveys on manufacturing firms from counties in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta Chinas two most developed regions . The empirical results obtained using the difference in differences method show that HSR connection promotes firm innovation in peripheral areas which is larger in the Yangtze River Delta and increases over time but switches from promoting process innovations to stimulating product innovation . Further studies show that HSR connection promotes innovation by arousing entrepreneurs awareness of the importance of innovation and intellectual property protection opening new sources for innovation and bringing about market size effects .

@highlight We directly test the companion innovation hypothesis of transportation improvement.
@highlight Chinas high speed rail is used as a natural experiment.
@highlight Three waves of large scale innovation survey and difference in differences method are used.
@highlight High speed rail connection promotes manufacturing firms innovation.
@highlight Three channels of companion innovation hypothesis are tested.
