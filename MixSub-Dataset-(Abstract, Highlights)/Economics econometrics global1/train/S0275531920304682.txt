 This study presents an overview of the state of the art in trade credit research by examining 1191 publications between 1955 and 2019 . Applying bibliometrics and econometrics the study compares the extant research across the three sub domains of banking and finance production and operations and accounting . Findings suggest that the financial emergency in the global market had resulted in a watershed moment in trade credit research . About 69 of the literature was found to have emerged after the global economic crisis of 2008 . A network analysis grouped the trade credit articles into four major and four minor clusters . The banking and financing cluster exhibited the highest growth followed by the production and operation cluster while the perspectives of accounting are yet to gain traction . Conversely reputation of the publishing hub empirical studies and the production and operational dimensions of the research positively and significantly influence citations . Alongside a thorough introspection the study also provides new areas to direct the course of future research .
