 Discrete recognition is a long standing and ubiquitous accounting practice but it has been widely criticized for suppressing information and inducing accounting motivated transactions . We study a model to examine the economic consequences of shifting away from discrete recognition to a continuous measurement approach . Without manipulation discrete recognition is less informative than the continuous approach . However the continuous regime induces more manipulation . The equilibrium informativeness is determined by both the accounting standard and endogenous manipulation . Discrete recognition is more informative than its continuous counterpart precisely when manipulation is a severe threat . We respond to the recent call in Kothari Ramanna and Skinner for using positive accounting theory to explain certain long standing accounting practices . We also discuss the model s implications for fair value accounting .

@highlight Recognition is a long standing accounting practice but it is criticized for suppressing information and inviting manipulation.
@highlight We show that discrete recognition generates more informative reports than a continuous approach if and only if the threat of evidence management is sufficiently severe.
@highlight We offer a rationale for recognition and extend the two step representation of accounting measurement.
@highlight We introduce an ex ante manipulation technology that generates the intuitive result that manipulation reduces the informativeness of the reports.
