 This paper analyzes the effects of financial globalization on growth in developing countries focusing on its interaction with exchange rate volatility . Based on dynamic panel data models and the two step system generalized method of moments estimator it replicates the method of Gaies et al . and extends it by exploring a new spillover effect of financial globalization in terms of exchange rate volatility measured by six different indicators . The findings show the positive influence of investmentglobalization on growth through the traditional channel of capital accumulation and by reducing the negative impact of exchange rate volatility . These impacts are not insured by indebtednessglobalization thereby shedding light on the governments decision in developing countries on foreign capital control policy . These results are robust to changes in the estimator and variables used .
