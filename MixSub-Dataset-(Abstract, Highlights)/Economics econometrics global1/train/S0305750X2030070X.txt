 This paper investigates the degree of association in the identification of the poor between the standard monetary FGT poverty measure and the Alkire Foster Multidimensional Poverty Index . For this purpose we use a measure of redundancy in the identification of the poor between the two poverty measures R

@highlight In Chile monetary and multidimensional poverty measures diverge in their identification of the poor over the last of 25years.
@highlight The diverging identification of the poor is associated to the reduction of household size rurality and improved household education.
@highlight The diverging identification of the poor can be a general process. It might have distributive consequences on the poor in transition countries.
@highlight The household non eligibility across indicators of the multidimensional poverty index is a relevant empirical issue.
