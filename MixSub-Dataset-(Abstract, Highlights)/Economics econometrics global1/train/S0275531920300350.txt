 We examine the effect of short selling on firms environmental pollution control behavior . Using novel data from Chinese listed firms we demonstrate that when the short selling of stocks is permitted the respective firms invest more in pollution protection . Consequently ex ante threats to short selling could potentially explain firms investment in pollution protection . In contrast we do not find a positive relation between margin trading and firms pollution protection expenses . We further discover that the effect of short selling is more pronounced in firms with lower institutional ownership and lower market competition . These findings shed light on the role of short sales in pollution abatement .
