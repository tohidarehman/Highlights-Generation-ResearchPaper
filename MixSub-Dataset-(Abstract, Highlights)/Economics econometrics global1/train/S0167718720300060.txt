 In this article we revive an old debate in the law and economics literature the relative role of public and reputational sanctions in deterring misconduct . We propose an empirical framework which accounts for public sanctions and a more direct measure of reputational sanctions harnessing recent developments in opinion mining . We use the intensity and the sentiment of media exposure of misconduct as a measure of reputational effect and thus approximation of the reputational sanction . As a demonstration we combine an event study approach sentiment analysis and econometric techniques on a sample of 339 listed cartel member firms prosecuted by the European Commission between 1992 and 2015 . Our results offer evidence that in the context of cartels public and reputational sanctions act as substitutes where there is a reputational penalty increasing this penalty reduces the effect of the public sanction . One the other hand in the absence of a reputational punishment the effect of the cartel fine steps in .

@highlight We study reputational and public sanctions fines on a sample of 339 listed cartel member firms prosecuted by the European Commission between 1992 and 2015.
@highlight We combine an event study approach sentiment analysis and econometric techniques.
@highlight We find that cartel members are financially more hurt at detection than at decision.
@highlight Fines play a key role on a narrow window around the decision while reputational sanctions reflect value losses on a larger time period.
@highlight We find evidence for public and reputational sanctions acting as substitutesa result confirmed under various robustness checks.
