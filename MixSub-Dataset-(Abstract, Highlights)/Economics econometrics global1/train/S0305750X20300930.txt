 Precipitated by rapid globalization rising inequality population growth and longevity gains social protection programs have been on the rise in low and middle income countries in the last three decades . However the introduction of public benefits could displace informal mechanisms for risk protection which are especially prevalent in LMICs . If the displacement of private transfers is considerably large the expansion of social protection programs could even lead to social welfare loss . In this paper we critically survey the recent empirical literature on crowd out effects in response to public policies specifically in the context of LMICs . We review and synthesize patterns from the behavioral response to various types of social protection programs . Furthermore we specifically examine for heterogeneous treatment effects by important socio economic characteristics . We conclude by drawing on lessons from our synthesis of studies . If poverty reduction objectives are considered along with careful program targeting that accounts for potential crowd out effects there may well be a net social gain .

@highlight Social protection programs generate displacement of private transfers a scenario that is also known as crowding out.
@highlight We document overwhelming evidence that public benefits result in considerable crowding out.
@highlight We document stark heterogeneity of the estimates by important demographic characteristics.
@highlight The two aspects of the crowd out effect the extensive and the intensive margin reinforce each other.
@highlight In specific circumstances crowding in could occur.
