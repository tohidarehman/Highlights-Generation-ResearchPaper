 Renewable energy has a strong synergy with some of the sustainable development goals thus its successful deployment can potentially result in an impact on these SDGs . In this study we examine the synergy effect of renewable electricity on selected SDGs via the electricity prices for the European Union countries . Using panel data and a two step estimation approach our findings indicate a strong synergy effect between renewable electricity prices SDG 7 and SDG 8 . The results further reveal that SDG 12 accounts for most of the future renewable electricity price variation whereas future variation in SDG 7 and SDG 13 are explained mostly by SDG 8 and SDG 12 respectively .

@highlight Renewable electricity consumption has a positive effect on the average EU electricity price.
@highlight SDG 8G economic growth and SDG 12 are complementary in achieving a lower renewable electricity price in the EU.
@highlight Improvement in SDG 13 and SDG 12 has a positive influence on SDG 7 in the EU.
@highlight SDG 12 influences most of the future renewable electricity price changes in the EU.
