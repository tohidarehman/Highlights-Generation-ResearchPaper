 We conduct unstructured negotiations in a laboratory experiment designed to empirically assess the predictive power of models of the multilateral negotiations observed in diverse strategic settings . For concreteness we consider two sellers negotiating with a buyer who wants to make only one trade and we categorize the models by whether introducing a second seller to bilateral negotiations

@highlight We conduct unstructured buyer seller negotiations in a laboratory experiment.
@highlight One or two sellers negotiate with a buyer who wants to make only one trade.
@highlight We compare observed outcomes to predictions from three categories of models.
@highlight Models vary in how outcomes differ in bilateral and multilateral negotiations.
@highlight Evidence suggests presence of extra seller in negotiations does not benefit buyer.
