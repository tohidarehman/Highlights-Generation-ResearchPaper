 Agricultural systems are highly sensitive to climate change . Most studies focus on the effect of heat and water availability on crop yields but little is known about the impact of changes in intra seasonal climate variability . Also beyond the effect on crop yields mostly focused on single cropping systems and major world crops little analysis has been done on more complex diversified and low input cropping systems like those prevalent in the Andean region . This study investigates whether Andean farmers respond to increasing climate variability by increasing crop diversity and by switching to crops which better tolerate heterogeneous environmental conditions . Since previous studies show that crop diversification fosters resilience of agricultural systems decreasing crop portfolio diversity in an increasingly variable environment may challenge farms sustainability . The data used in the analysis combines district level socio economic information from two agrarian censuses

@highlight Most farm households in the Peruvian Andes hold diversified low input cropping systems.
@highlight Previous work shows that crop diversification intercropping and selection of tolerant crops can foster resilience to environmental stress.
@highlight In colder districts 11C intra seasonal temperature variability leads to more concentration into tolerant crops and less intercropping.
@highlight This effect is especially strong in the Southern region with larger indigenous population and limited access to dynamic markets .
@highlight Findings raise concern on current adaptation responses that may hamper agricultural system s sustainability in the face of climate change.
