Therefore the better theoretical understanding of the evolutionary mechanism of age classified populations interacting via migration is a timely modelling methodological task . This paper is a

@highlight This is a methodological contribution to policies concerning pension systems.
@highlight The demographic effect of free migration between countries of the EU is studied.
@highlight Such system of populations is proved to converge to equilibrium age distribution.
@highlight A convergence theorem is also extended to sex structured population systems.
@highlight Impact of migration on the sustainability of PAYG pension systems is also analysed.
