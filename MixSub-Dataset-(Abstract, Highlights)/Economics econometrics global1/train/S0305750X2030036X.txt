 Few developing countries have participated in the environmental goods agreement negotiations to reduce barriers on trade in Environmental Goods . Reasons for this reluctance are first reviewed along with a comprehensive description of barriers to trade on two lists of EGs used in negotiations the APEC list comprising mostly industrial products representative of high income countries that served as point of departure on the negotiations for an Environmental Goods Agreement and a list of Environmentally Preferable Products more representative of the perceived interests of developing countries . The paper then revisits and extends the literature on the estimation of barriers to trade in EGs for these lists . These estimates are carried out with a structural gravity model with new data on bilateral tariffs and a new classification of NTBs a measure of regulatory overlap in bilateral trade . Results show that tariffs reduce the intensity of bilateral trade . Regulatory harmonization as captured by an increase in regulatory overlap is also estimated to be conducive to more intense bilateral trade .

@highlight Successful conclusion of the WTO Environmental Goods Agreement can be a triple win for developing countries.
@highlight The paper demonstrates why developing countries have not taken part in negotiations.
@highlight The paper provides indicators for tariff and non tariff barriers for two EG lists.
@highlight Countries that have submitted EG lists set them merchantilistically.
@highlight Broadening of the EG lists could entice the developing countries participation in negotiations.
