 This paper proposes a methodology for measuring the quality of employment from a multidimensional and public policy perspective in Latin American developing countries using household and labour force survey data from 2015 . The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the QoE can be measured using a multidimensional methodology that can inform policy makers about the state of their labour markets in a way that complements traditional variables such as participation or unemployment rates which are not always good indicators of labour market performance in developing countries with large informal sectors .

@highlight This paper measures the Quality of Employment QoE from a multidimensional perspective in nine Latin American countries.
@highlight The index includes three dimensions income job security and employment conditions.

@highlight This paper highlights important differences between the QoE in different Latin American countries.
@highlight While Chile has the best results in the region Paraguay has the worst followed by Mexico Bolivia and Peru.
