 Climate change and land are linked politically . Climate change politics intersects with the global land rush in extensive and complex ways the impacts of which affect villagers profoundly . These interconnections occur in direct and indirect ways and are often subtle but that does not make them less important it only makes the challenge of governing such dynamics in the interests of marginalized working poor people even more difficult . In this paper we focus our analysis on indirect and subtle interconnections . Examining empirical cases in Northern Shan State in Myanmar we conclude that these interconnections occur in at least three broad ways in which climate change politics can be a trigger for land grabbing a legitimating process for land grabs or a de legitimating process for peoples climate change mitigation and adaptation practices . These interconnections in turn stoke old and provoke new political axes of conflict within and between state and social forces .
