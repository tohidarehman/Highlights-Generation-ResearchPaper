 We study the increasingly popular hunger marketing strategy adopted by many high tech startups to launch their products . In a two period model a firm offers an artificially low introductory price and also imposes a limit on the quantity available for sale in the first period which leads to a shortage in the equilibrium . We show that when effective word of mouth is present such a strategy allows a firm to credibly convince the market of the premium quality of its product . We demonstrate that word of mouth plays a critical role in catalyzing the signaling mechanism . When word of mouth becomes more efficient e.g . enabled by social media shortage is larger in the equilibrium and the introductory price falls further . Our study provides a rationale for hunger marketing .
