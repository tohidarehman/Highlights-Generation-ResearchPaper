 What is the motivation for sharing useful information among community members In order to reveal the motivation of information exchanges we present the case of a Facebook group which shares common crop practices and the majority of the members are farmers . We construct monthly panel data to addresses the group members motivations for information exchange between January 2015 and May 2017 . Using data we find that As the number of ones information sharing a month ago increases by one unit the probabilities of her information sharing and of her inquiry increase by 5 and 1 respectively . Further as the number of positive responses one receives from other members in the past increases by one unit the probability of her current information sharing increases by 0.03 . These findings suggest that reciprocity does play a significant role in motivating information exchange even in virtual communities of practice similar to those in offline communities . We also confirm that professional reputation is one of the motivations for information sharing and that there is a positive effect of peers prosocial behavior .
