 This study evaluates the impact of recessions on households vulnerable to poverty . The results indicate that recessions impact vulnerable households asymmetrically in comparison to the impact of growth on poor households . We also demonstrate that this outcome is significantly influenced by a countrys extent of development . We argue that a direct consequence of the foregoing is that the efficacy of growth in poverty reduction tends to be under stated by conventional measures of poor households responses to economic growth and that safety nets need to be constructed to incorporate vulnerability to recessions .

@highlight Growth and recessions impact poor and vulnerable households asymmetrically.
@highlight The growth elasticity of poverty reduction understates the effectiveness of growth in reducing poverty.
@highlight Vulnerable households in low income countries demonstrate strong resilience to recessions.
