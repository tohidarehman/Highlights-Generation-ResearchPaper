 Poor sanitation has large negative impacts on environmental quality health and well being . Sanitation infrastructure is particularly lacking in India where in 2011 66 of households did not own a toilet . Inadequate sanitation is a large contributor to diarrheal related diseases which cause 300 000 deaths in Indian children each year . We exploit an experimental sanitation campaign in rural Odisha India to examine the relationship between sanitation improvements in early childhood and long term cognitive development . We build on literature linking child health improvements to cognitive development and labor market outcomes and show that improvements in sanitation coverage can have large human capital returns . Using treatment assignment as an instrument for village latrine coverage we find that children who belonged to a village with higher latrine coverage scored significantly higher on a cognitive test measuring analytic ability ten years later . We find that this effect is much stronger among girls than boys .

@highlight There is a positive relationship between village latrine coverage in early childhood and cognitive test scores ten years later.
@highlight Cognitive test scores are measured using Ravens Colored Progressive Matrices.
@highlight The effect of latrine coverage on subsequent test scores is significantly larger among girls than boys.
@highlight The findings are robust across intent to treat models instrumental variable models and a number of robustness checks.
