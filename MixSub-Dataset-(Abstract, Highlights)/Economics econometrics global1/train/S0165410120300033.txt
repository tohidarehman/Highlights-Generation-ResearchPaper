 The events of September 11 2001 prompted sweeping cross border coordination efforts for securities regulators around the globe . After 9 11 the International Organization of Securities Commissions forged a nonbinding arrangementthe Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Consultation and Cooperation and the Exchange of Information that standardized the protocol for information sharing among participating securities regulators . Because regulators from different countries entered the MMoU at different times their enlistments created a set of staggered shocks . I use these shocks to show that the resulting cross border cooperation increases cross border enforcement and reduces the cost of liquidity provision in the capital markets of participating countries . These results support the conclusion that the MMoU helps fill gaps in cross border regulation that historically exposed investors to information asymmetry agency costs and expropriation risks .

@highlight Antiterrorism efforts prompted regulators to rethink their level of cooperation with foreign counterparts.
@highlight IOSCO created a widely used cooperative mechanism the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding MMoU for regulators.
@highlight The MMoU resolves numerous impediments to sharing information with and executing tactics on behalf of foreign regulators.
@highlight Countries enter the MMoU at different times creating linkages that are staggered across time and countries.
@highlight The linkages are associated with increased enforcement and enhanced liquidity for affected cross listed shares.
