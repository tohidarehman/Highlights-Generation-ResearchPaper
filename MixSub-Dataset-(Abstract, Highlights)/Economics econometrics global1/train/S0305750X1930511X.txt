 This survey argues that after decades of seemingly continuous progress in reducing gender inequality in developing and developed countries since about 2000 there has been an unexpected stagnation and regress in many dimensions of gender inequality in many parts of the world . This is most visible in labor markets but also visible across a range of dimensions of gender inequality . After documenting these developments the paper suggests causes for this change before suggesting policies that might tackle remaining gender inequalities more effectively .
