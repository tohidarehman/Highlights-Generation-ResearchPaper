 We study whether social media can play a negative information role by impeding price discovery in the presence of highly speculative rumors . We focus on merger rumors where most do not materialize . We find that merger rumors accompanied by greater Twitter activity elicit greater immediate market reaction even though rumor related Twitter activity is unrelated to the probability of merger realization . The price distortion associated with tweet volume persists weeks after a rumor and reverses only after eight weeks . The price distortion is more pronounced for rumors tweeted by Twitter users with greater social influence for target firms with low institutional ownership and for rumors that supply more details . Our evidence suggests that social media can be a rumor mill that hinders the market s price discovery of potentially false information .
