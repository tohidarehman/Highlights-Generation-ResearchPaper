 Understanding livelihoods patterns is a key component of food security and poverty analysis . The Household Economy Approach is a leading method of conceptualizing organizing and analyzing information on livelihoods systems that is widely used within the food security analysis community . This approach is typically informed by data collected using qualitative methods . However the increasing availability of large scale household survey datasets presents an opportunity to explore the degree to which these data can be used to strengthen HEA analysis . Here we present the results of a novel pilot study that uses large scale household survey data to create livelihoods products for Nigeria using a combination of spatial interpolation principal component analysis and cluster analysis . We show how these techniques can leverage existing data to create low cost maps of quantitatively described livelihoods that are stable over time and conceptually consistent with products derived using traditional methods . We also outline future research for how to incorporate these outputs into practitioner analysis .

@highlight The Household Economy Approach HEA is a framework commonly used by food security analysts for describing livelihoods.
@highlight HEA typically relies on data collected using qualitative methods.
@highlight To date attempts to describe livelihoods using quantitative data have not fully met practitioner needs.
@highlight We use spatial interpolation with PCA cluster analysis to producestable HEA compatible zone maps and descriptions.
@highlight This approach has the potential to improve the quality and reduce the cost of livelihoods analysis.
