 This paper studies a simple model to underline the importance of consumer search for understanding wholesale contracts between manufacturers and retailers . The model has one manufacturer and two retailers who compete in a homogeneous goods market where the wholesale contract is unobserved by consumers . If the manufacturer is in the position to offer two part tariffs the model without search either does not have an equilibrium wholesale contract due to the well known opportunism problem or it is characterized by the absence of a fixed fee . With consumer search an equilibrium wholesale contract always exists overcoming the opportunism problem and is always characterized by some fixed fee . If the manufacturer offers linear wholesale contracts the differences between the models with and without consumer search are less pronounced but remain even if the search cost vanishes . Thus the vertical contracting literature can not simply ignore search costs by saying that they are probably small and can therefore be neglected .

@highlight Consumer search in retail markets has an important impact on B2B contracts between manufacturers and retailers.
@highlight Consumer search overcomes the well known problem of opportunism in vertical contracting.
@highlight Differences in vertical contracts in markets with and without search costs remain even if the search costs become arbitrarily small.
