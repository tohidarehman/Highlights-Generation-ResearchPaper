 Citizens respond to information about democracy according to whether they are electoral winners or losers . This difference occurs both at the national and constituency level . Democratic interventions that seek to promote accountability and transparency might therefore impact citizens differentially depending on the political party that people support . In a placebo controlled experimental design carried out in Kenya we find that democracy promotion boosts the external efficacy and political participation of ruling party partisans but leaves those from the opposition unaffected . These responsesbased on national incumbencyare further conditioned by the partisanship of the MP of the constituency where the voter resides . These findings throw new light on the impact of civic interventions such as Get Out the Vote and civic education common in Africa as well as elsewhere as we show their benefits accrue to the electoral winners rather than to the losers .
