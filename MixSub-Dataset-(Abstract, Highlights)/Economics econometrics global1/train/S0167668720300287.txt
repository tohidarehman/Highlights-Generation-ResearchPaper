 This paper considers the robust optimal reinsuranceinvestment strategy selection problem with price jumps and correlated claims for an ambiguity averse insurer . The correlated claims mean that future claims are correlated with historical claims which is measured by an extrapolative bias . In our model the AAI transfers part of the risk due to insurance claims via reinsurance and invests the surplus in a financial market consisting of a risk free asset and a risky asset whose price is described by a jumpdiffusion model . Under the criterion of maximizing the expected utility of terminal wealth we obtain closed form solutions for the robust optimal reinsuranceinvestment strategy and the corresponding value function by using the stochastic dynamic programming approach . In order to examine the influence of investment risk on the insurers investment behavior we further study the time consistent reinsuranceinvestment strategy under the meanvariance framework and also obtain the explicit solution . Furthermore we examine the relationship among the optimal reinsuranceinvestment strategies of the AAI under three typical cases . A series of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate how the robust optimal reinsuranceinvestment strategy varies with model parameters and result analyses reveal some interesting phenomena and provide useful guidances for reinsurance and investment in reality .
