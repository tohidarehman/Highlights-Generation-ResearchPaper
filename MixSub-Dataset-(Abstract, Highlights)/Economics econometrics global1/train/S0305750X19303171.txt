 Recent research has increased interest in the intersection of land tenure and gender roles in African agriculture . While formalization of land ownership has been found to have important gender impacts time use and management remain critical to both the productivity of agricultural operations as well as the welfare of household members . Thus it is important to understand how gender intersects with the relationship between the ownership and operation of plots . We use plot level data from nationally representative household surveys in Ethiopia and Malawi to characterize the structure and domain of control over land in each household . We then answer the following research questions 1 are there any gender gaps in the degrees of the concordance among different domains of controls and 2 how does the structure of ownership and managerial rights affect labor allocations on plots We find that for both males and females sole managerial rights are most likely to occur in plots owned exclusively by either gender . However on jointly owned plots instances of sole planting rights are almost exclusively male . We also find that while females supply more of their own labor to plots they control the pattern of own gender bias in labor allocation varies with each structure domain combination . The heterogeneity suggests gender inequality analyses related to land rights are sensitive to the choice of domain of control .

@highlight We investigate land ownership management and farm labor in Ethiopia and Malawi.
@highlight We find high gender gaps concordance between ownership and managerial rights.
@highlight Jointness in plot ownership and management slightly disfavors females.
@highlight Labor allocation and plot control follow gender concordant pattern.
@highlight Own gender effects vary across different domains of plot controls.
