 Using public procurement to promote private innovation activities has attracted increasing attention recently . Germany implemented a legal change in its procurement framework in 2009 which allowed government agencies to specify innovative aspects of procured products as selection criteria in calls for tender . We analyze a sample of 3410 German firms to investigate whether this reform stimulated innovation in the business sector . Across a wide range of specifications OLS nearest neighbor matching IV regressions and difference in differences we find a robust and significant effect of innovation directed public procurement on turnover with new products and services . At the same time our results demonstrate that public procurement mainly stimulates innovations of more incremental nature rather than true market novelties .
