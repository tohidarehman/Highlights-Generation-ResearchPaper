 We experimentally investigate the determinants of post cartel tacit collusion the effects of PCTC on market outcomes and potential policy measures aimed at its prevention . PCTC occurs robustly with or without fines or leniency and is determined both by collusive price hysteresis and learning about cartel partners characteristics and strategies . As a result it is also strongly related to the preceding cartel success . PCTC generates a downward bias in the estimated cartel overcharges . This threatens the effectiveness of deterrence induced by private damage litigation and fines imposed on colluding firms based on the overcharge . This bias further increases with preceding cartel stability such that especially more stable sets of colluding firms may be deterred less when PCTC is present . Rematching colluding subjects with strangers within a session prevents PCTC . This indicates that barring colluding managers from their posts could help impede PCTC in the field .

@highlight Post cartel tacit collusion can be disrupted by removing managers from the market.
