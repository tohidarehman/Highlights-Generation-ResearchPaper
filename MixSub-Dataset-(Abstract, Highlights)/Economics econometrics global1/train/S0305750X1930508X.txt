 Improving electricity access in low income countries is complicated because of high service costs and low electricity consumption levels in rural areas . This study elucidates this problem by analyzing poor Sub Saharan African households willingness to pay for different types of electricity access including both grid and lower cost off grid technologies . We show both theoretically and empirically that at low levels of income low cost decentralized off grid solar technologies provide the highest utility from the households perspective . We therefore recommend concentrating the near term rural household electrification efforts on these technologies .

@highlight Consumer preferences costs and quality of electricity determine access technology.
@highlight Electricity access has a high value relative to households expenditures.
@highlight Willingness to pay for electricity access is low relative to its service cost.
@highlight Households income is critical driver of willingness to pay for electricity access.
@highlight Short term household electrification should focus on off grid solar technologies.
