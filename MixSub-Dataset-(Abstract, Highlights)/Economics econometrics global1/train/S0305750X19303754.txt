 Renewable energy investments are expanding across the world at an astonishing rate . The United States and Europe obtained early advantages in renewable energy technologies . However East Asian late industrializers have now extended substantial support to domestic renewable energy manufacturing firms alongside encouraging increased deployment of renewable energy projects . In the solar energy sector Chinese companies now dominate global production of solar cells and panels . Other developing countries in South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa have lagged in their support to manufacturing segments of renewable energy sectors . Yet many countries still aim to promote domestic production of solar panels and cells though such priorities are often secondary to increasing deployment of solar power projects .

@highlight The installed capacity of solar energy has grown at an exponential rate.
@highlight Prioritising low tariffs while increasing generation has increased import dependency.
@highlight Transnational coalitions of firms block support to domestic manufacturers.
@highlight Recent policies show that reviving manufacturing may be difficult.
@highlight Prioritising deployment above manufacturing will lock in dependency on imports.
