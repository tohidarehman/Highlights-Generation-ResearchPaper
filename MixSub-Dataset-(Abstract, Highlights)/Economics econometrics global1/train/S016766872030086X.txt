 Expectile bears some interesting properties in comparison to the industry wide expected shortfall in terms of assessment of tail risk . We study the relationship between expectile and expected shortfall using duality results and the link to optimized certainty equivalent . Lower and upper bounds of expectile are derived in terms of expected shortfall as well as a characterization of expectile in terms of expected shortfall . Further we study the asymptotic behavior of expectile with respect to expected shortfall as the confidence level goes to 1 in terms of extreme value distributions . We use concentration inequalities to illustrate that the estimation of value at risk requires larger sample size than expected shortfall and expectile for heavy tail distributions when

@highlight In this paper we study this relationship using duality results and the link to optimized certainty equivalent from Ben Tal and Teboulle.
@highlight Lower and upper bounds of expectile are derived in terms of expected shortfall as well as a characterization of expectile in terms of expected shortfall.
@highlight Following recent works we further study the asymptotic behavior of expectile but with respect to expected shortfall in terms of extreme value distributions.
@highlight Finally the characterization of expectile as a function of expected shortfall allows to provide explicit or semi explicit expressions of expectile for many classical distributions.
