 As countries turn wealthier some health indicators such as child mortality seem to have well defined trends . However others including cardiovascular conditions do not follow clear linear patterns of change with economic development . Abnormal blood pressure is a serious health risk factor with consequences for population growth and longevity as well as public and private expenditure in health care and labor productivity . This also increases the risk of the population in certain pandemics such as COVID 19 . To determine the correlation of income and blood pressure we analyzed time series for the mean systolic blood pressure of mens population and nominal Gross Domestic Product per capita for 136 countries from 1980 to 2008 using regression and statistical analysis by Pearsons correlation . Our study finds a trend similar to an inverted U shaped curve or a Heart Kuznets Curve . There is a positive correlation in low income countries and a negative correlation in high income countries . As country income rises people tend to change their diets and habits and have better access to health services and education which affects blood pressure . However the latter two may not offset the rise in blood pressure until countries reach a certain income . Investing early in health education and preventive health care could avoid the sharp increase in blood pressure as countries develop and therefore avoiding the Heart Kuznets Curve and its economic and human impacts .

@highlight Abnormal blood pressure has consequences for public and private expenditure in health care and labor productivity.
@highlight GDP per capita GDPPC has a strong correlation with blood pressure SBP as a Heart Kuznets Curve HKC 
@highlight As poor countries GDPPC increases SBP tends to increase up to a certain income when the SBP tends to decline with the increase of GDPPC.
@highlight Early investments in health education and preventive health care can avoid the sharp increase in cardiac problems.
