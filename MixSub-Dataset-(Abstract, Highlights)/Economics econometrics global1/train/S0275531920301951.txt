 In analyzing newly collected data on the ultimate ownership structure of publicly traded firms in nine East Asian economies we contribute to international accounting research by providing evidence on earnings management in insider controlled firms in this region . We find that family controlled firms engage in less accrual based earnings management than other insider controlled firms . Our analysis suggests that controlling families unlike other types of ultimate owners tend to substitute real earnings management for accrual based earnings management . To help empirically clarify the role that two incentives play in driving the substitution between real and accruals based earnings management we examine their valuation impact and find that both types negatively affect the future valuation of family firms . In another set of results consistent with expectations we document that country level investor protection and firm external financing demand shape the practice of earnings management in family controlled firms .
