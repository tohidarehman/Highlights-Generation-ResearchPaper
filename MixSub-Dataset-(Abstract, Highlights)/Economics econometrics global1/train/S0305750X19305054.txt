 Household agricultural production for self consumption is often highlighted by nutritionists as the main route to increasing household food security and nutritional status especially for the poor in developing countries . At the same time the income gains from specializing in fewer crops and selling the surplus product could be an alternate route to improved nutritional status . We use Tanzanian data to study linkages between the diversity and market orientation of a households agricultural production the quality and diversity of their diets and the nutritional status of their children . We find that diversifying a households agricultural production significantly increases diversity in that households diet but the positive nutritional effects are small . We also find that market orientation has no clear effect on dietary diversity . At the same time however the nutritional status of children is not found to be linked clearly to general dietary diversity . On the other hand factors such as education and overall income have strong and significant effects on both household dietary diversity and child nutrition . Thus policies for increasing the quality of childrens diets improving childrens nutritional status and enhancing the overall dietary diversity of farm households should incorporate those factors .

@highlight Agricultural diversification increases household dietary diversification.
@highlight The magnitude of the effect is however small.
@highlight Market orientation has no significant effect on dietary diversity.
@highlight Education and overall income effects have strong effect on dietary diversity.
@highlight Child nutrition status is not clearly linked to general dietary diversity.
