 A large body of research on Indias rapid economic growth since 1991 also documents increasing regional disparities . In this paper we use unsaturated night light data to challenge this dominant narrative of unequal growth . For 520 districts spanning a 15year period we find overwhelming evidence of absolute convergence . Dividing districts further into rural and urban areas we also show that this catching up can be attributed mainly to faster growth in rural areas . Geographically disadvantaged districts those further away from the coast with lower agricultural suitability and more rugged terrain also grew faster . The convergence results are not associated with major infrastructure and education initiatives that overlapped with the period of analysis and also hold for alternative measures of night lights that cover a longer period of time .

@highlight The paper uses unsaturated night light data to investigate convergence within India over a 15 year period 19962010.
@highlight Unlike the widely held view that regional disparities are increasing we find absolute convergence at the district level.
@highlight This convergence happens mainly due to faster catchup in poorer less well lit rural areas. Urban Convergence is slower.
@highlight Districts that ranked lower in geographical advantages also grew faster during this period.
@highlight The results hold even after controlling for major policy initiatives that overlapped this period.
