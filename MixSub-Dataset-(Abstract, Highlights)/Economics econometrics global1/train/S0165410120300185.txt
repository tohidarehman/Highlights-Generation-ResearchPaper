 We test the political cost hypothesis using local soldier fatalities as a source of as if random variation in the threat of political costs for local defense firms . Soldier fatalities vary the threat of political costs for defense firms because the U.S. tradition of shared sacrifice during war vulgarizes war profits amid dead soldiers . Local defense firms record more income decreasing accruals equal to 1.17 percent of total assets in response to a one standard deviation increase in local soldier fatalities . A wide variety of robustness tests corroborate our inferences .

@highlight Local soldier fatalities randomly vary the threat of political costs for defense firms.
@highlight Defense firms respond by using accounting choices to orchestrate the appearance of lower income.
@highlight Results support the political cost hypothesis.
