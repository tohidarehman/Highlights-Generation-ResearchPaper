 This paper studies the design of license auctions when the number of licenses allocated in the auction determines structure of the post auction market . I first show that a sequence of conditional reserve prices that specify minimum acceptable bid at each supply level can be used to determine supply endogenously . Then I construct a static auction called multi dimensional uniform price auction and a dynamic auction called Walrasian clock auction that allow the auctioneer to condition reserve price on supply and allow bidders to condition bids on supply . I show that both proposed auctions can implement the efficient market structure that maximizes total surplus in the post auction market in a dominant strategy equilibrium . I next characterize the optimal auction and show that the two proposed auctions can yield the optimal revenue under a sequence of optimal reserve prices .

@highlight I study the design of license auctions when the number of licenses allocated in the auction determines structure of a post auction market.
@highlight A sequence of conditional reserve prices that specify minimum acceptable bid at each supply level can be used to determine supply endogenously.
@highlight I propose two practical auctions that allow the auctioneer to condition reserve prices on supply and allow bidders to condition bids on supply to implement the efficient market structure.
@highlight The two proposed auctions can also maximize revenue under optimal reserve prices.
