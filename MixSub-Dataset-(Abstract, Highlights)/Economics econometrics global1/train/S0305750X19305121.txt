 Immigrants tend to buy products from their home countries . As a result the more immigrants of a given ethnicity a country has the more it will tend to import from those immigrants countries of origin . This effect of migrant heterogeneity is ignored by the standard gravity literature that assumes homogeneous preferences among resident consumers . This paper embeds that observed regularity into a structural gravity model . Gravity derived from the Almost Ideal Demand System generates bilateral trade shares with three distinct components ethnic composition of the resident population bilateral trade cost and per capita income . Using international trade and transnational migration data among 40 countries this paper estimates the home bias of each ethnic group in tastes . The results show that consumers tastes for products from their country of origin deviate from unbiased levels by 35 percent on average . Ethnic taste bias is found to explain half of the trade bias . Counterfactuals suggest that anti immigration policy significantly impedes trade with immigrants countries of origin .
