 This paper studies strategic interactions between public and private enforcement of accounting regulation and their consequences for the deterrence of financial misreporting . We develop an economic model with a manager a public enforcement agency and an investor and derive equilibrium strategies for manipulative effort routine investigative effort and costly private litigation . Our main results are as follows . Strengthening private enforcement unambiguously enhances deterrence whereas strengthening public enforcement can exacerbate misreporting due to a crowding out of private enforcement . We provide conditions under which the enforcer s investigation incentives first increase and then decrease in the strength of private enforcement public and private enforcement are strategic substitutes the number of enforcement actions is misleading about public enforcement effectiveness and strengthening private enforcement decreases litigation risk . We also discuss implications of our results for empirical research .

@highlight Private litigation assumes a monitoring role and provides investigation incentives for public enforcers.
@highlight Strengthening routine public enforcement can weaken rather than strengthen misreporting deterrence because of a crowding out of private litigation.
@highlight Public enforcement and private litigation can be strategic substitutes.
@highlight The number of enforcement actions is not always a reliable measure for public enforcement effectiveness.
@highlight Litigation risk can increase or decrease as a result of strengthening private litigation.
