 Defining and measuring women s economic empowerment has been at the centre of the current debates among international development scholars and practitioners . The lack of clear consensus on both may limit widespread efforts to design and evaluate programs and policies aimed at improving women s well being . Building on intra household allocation models and on Sen and Kabeer this paper proposes a conceptual framework of intrahousehold decision making which can accommodate many classes of WEE measures . It proposes a typology of WEE measures which combines proximity of concept to measurability . Findings from a review of the scholarly literature between 2005 and 2020 are then presented to demonstrate the diversity of published approaches that exist to measure WEE .
