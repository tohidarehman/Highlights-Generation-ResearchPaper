 Cash transfers are increasingly high on the agenda of most governments and development partners in low and middle income countries . Even though burgeoning evidence points to CTs impact on the social determinants of health there is little evidence about how and why CTs work to influence the SDoH . This paper reports on a realist evaluation aimed at developing a middle range theory that explains how CTs influence the SDoH by exploring program mechanisms of change and associated contextual factors . Qualitative interviewing was employed including key informant interviews in depth interviews and focus groups with program beneficiaries and observations .

@highlight For CTs to have greater impact on the SDoH there is a need for intersectoral collaboration.
@highlight CTs require community engagement and beneficiary education to function effectively.
@highlight Beneficiaries voice in program decision making is key CT mechanism of change.
@highlight The psychological context of decision making in extreme poverty needs attention in CT design and implementation.
