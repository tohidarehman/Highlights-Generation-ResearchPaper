 We study how biases in financial reporting affect managers incentives to develop innovative projects and to make appropriate investment decisions . Conservative reporting practices impose stricter verification standards for recognizing good news and reduce the chance that risky innovations will lead to favorable future earnings reports . Holding all else constant more conservative reporting therefore weakens the manager s incentive to work on innovative ideas consistent with informal arguments in the extant literature . However all else does not stay constant because the manager s pay plan will change in response to changes in the accounting system . We show that under optimal contracting more conservative accounting does not stifle innovation in organizations but rather increases incentives for innovation as long as conservatism reduces the risk of an overstatement .

@highlight We study how conservative accounting affects managers incentives to develop innovative projects and to make appropriate investment decisions.
@highlight Holding all else equal more conservative accounting impedes innovation.
@highlight When taking into account that incentive pay plans are optimally adjusted in response to changes in the accounting system conservatism improves investment efficiency and fosters innovation.
@highlight The model highlights the dangers of evaluating changes in accounting practices in isolation from other governance instruments such as incentive contracting.
