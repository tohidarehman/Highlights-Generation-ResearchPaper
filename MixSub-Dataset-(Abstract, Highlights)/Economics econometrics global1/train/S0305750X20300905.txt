 In 2015 Ethiopia experienced one of its worst droughts in decades . Using nationally representative data from before and after the event we do not find evidence that this drought led to widespread increases in chronic or acute child undernutrition . However further analysis indicates that chronic undernutrition rates did increase in drought exposed areas that had a limited road network . This finding suggests that the recent investments in road infrastructure in Ethiopia may have contributed towards better resilience against droughts .
