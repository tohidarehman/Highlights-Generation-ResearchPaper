 This paper analyzes two business practices on the mobile internet market paid prioritization and zero rating . These practices allow the internet service provider to discriminate different content types . With prioritization the ISP delivers content at different speeds with zero rating the ISP charges different prices . In recent years these practices have attracted considerable media attention and regulatory interest . When the asymmetry between content providers is limited in particular with regard to their ability to attract traffic or to monetize it we first show that the ISP can extract more surplus from consumers by privileging the relatively weaker content and restoring symmetry between content providers . Next we show that the ISP chooses prioritization when traffic is highly valuable for content providers and congestion is severe and zero rating in all other cases . Finally we find that a policy banning prioritization can lead to zero rating and a reduction in consumer surplus .
