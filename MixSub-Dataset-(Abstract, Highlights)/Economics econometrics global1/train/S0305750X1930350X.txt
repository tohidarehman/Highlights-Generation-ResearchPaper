 This paper analyzes the causal impact of retirement in China on Body Mass Index and weight which are a good gauge of the risk for some diseases . Many middle income developing countries are aging very rapidly and may have to adjust the retirement age to have financially feasible government budgets . It is important to know and understand any plausible health consequences of raising the retirement age in developing countries and which sub populations within these countries may be most affected . By using 2011 2013 and 2015 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study our identification strategy uses variation in Chinas mandatory retirement age with a fuzzy discontinuity design to examine an exogenous shock to retirement behavior . Our study finds that retirement will increase weight and BMI among men . This effect is much larger for men with low education . The channel may be that men with low education drink more and take less vigorous exercises after they get retired . Retirement does not affect weight and BMI for women . These effects are robust with different definitions of retirement narrow retirement bandwidth for samples as well as dropping samples with rural Hukou .
