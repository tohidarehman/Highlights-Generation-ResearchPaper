 We investigate whether increased investor demand for financial information arising from higher market uncertainty leads to greater media coverage of earnings announcements . We also investigate whether greater coverage during times of higher uncertainty further destabilizes financial markets because of greater attention based trading or alternatively improves trading and pricing by lowering investor acquisition and interpretation costs . When uncertainty is higher we find evidence of greater media coverage of earnings announcements and that the greater coverage leads to improvements in investor informedness information asymmetry and intraperiod price timeliness and greater trade by both retail and institutional investors . In contrast to the media serving an expanded role in improving capital markets during more uncertain times we fail to find that changes in firm initiated disclosures lead to similar improvements and find that less frequent analyst forecast revisions exacerbate problems in capital markets during earnings announcements .

@highlight The business press increases coverage around earnings announcements while decreasing coverage outside of earnings announcements during periods of high market uncertainty.
@highlight The increase in coverage during periods of high market uncertainty is greatest in news flashes and for bellwether and early announcing companies.
@highlight The increased coverage during periods of high market uncertainty leads to market improvements with more trading reduced information asymmetry and increased price timeliness.
@highlight Company disclosures and analysts forecasting activity do not respond in the same way or have the same market improving effects.
