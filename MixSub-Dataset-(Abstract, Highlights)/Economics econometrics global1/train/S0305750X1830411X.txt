 This article investigates the links between forests and poverty in India . We use original data from a household survey in two states of India to provide new insights into this relationship . The poorest are found to receive about 30 of their incomes from forests an amount that is higher than the income that they obtain from agriculture . We identify the correlates of greater environmental and forest income in the sample and also seek to examine whether environmental incomes are used only as a safety net during disasters or for basic consumption purposes too . Our results show that when negative shocks occur there is a higher relative dependence on environmental incomes . The results also suggest that those who are better off obtain higher levels of environmental income that the poorer . Overall the findings are consistent with environmental incomes and other sources of incomes being complements . In sum the results suggest that forest income is used for basic consumption is not a substitute for other sources of income and is not treated as an inferior good that is eschewed by richer groups in the survey .

@highlight The poorest obtain more income from forests than agriculture.
@highlight Forest income is used as a safety net in times of crises as well as providing basic consumption in good times.
@highlight Environmental incomes and other sources of income are complements.
@highlight Forests thus serve as a stepping stone to a better life rather than a millstone that slows progress out of poverty.
