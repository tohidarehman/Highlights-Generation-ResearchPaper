 By setting out rules for how food should be produced and processed to meet market requirements agricultural standards can connect farmers to lucrative markets . Yet their adoption has been far from widespread . Demographic factors have been shown to affect farmers decision to get certified to an agricultural standard . However little is known about the relationship between risk and certification despite evidence that risk aversion affects farmers production decisions . This paper examines the role of individual risk attitudes in the decision to get certified to an agricultural standard . I conducted a survey and a field experiment to elicit the risk preferences of Nepali small scale tea farmers who faced the decision of whether to get certified to the organic standard . The analysis uses an expected utility framework to investigate the relationship between risk preferences and certification decisions . Results indicate that farmers who are more risk averse have a higher propensity to get certified . These findings suggest that risk considerations should be incorporated into analysis of certification . They also provide concrete evidence against previous assumptions that only risk lovers get certified . Instead they suggest that certification schemes may provide a benefit not yet considered in the literature that of providing risk reduction opportunities to risk averse farmers in developing countries .
