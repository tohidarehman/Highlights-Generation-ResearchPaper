 While the main insurance sources for individuals with disability are understood less is known about how family support interacts with federal disability benefits . Using the Health and Retirement Study matched to administrative records I examine how disability benefits affect family support by comparing accepted and rejected disability applicants before and after benefit receipt . Receipt of disability insurance increases the probability of receiving any assistance from children by 18 percent and more than doubles the amount of in kind assistance . Disability insurance also increases the probability that children are paid for their help and reduces children s labor supply . These findings are largest for low income beneficiaries and those who recently lost a spouse suggesting that child assistance complements income provided by disability insurance and substitutes for other family assistance . Receipt of disability benefits allows the family to re optimize how they provide support and disability insurance is shared within the family in complementary ways .
