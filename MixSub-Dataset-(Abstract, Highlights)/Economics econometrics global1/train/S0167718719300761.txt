 We empirically examine horizontal mergers amongst Part D insurers with the aim of assessing how market power cost efficiencies and bargaining power affect premiums and coverage characteristics including drug access and out of pocket cost . Our results reveal that market power raises premiums but this is only a local effect that occurs in markets where the merging firms overlap . Mergers alter the bargaining process with upstream suppliers at both local and national levels affecting drug access and OOP cost . We find evidence of cost efficiencies when firms restructure by consolidating their plan offerings .
