 This paper reconciles conflicting evidence in prior literature on the relative ability of earnings and cash flows in predicting future cash flows . Further we investigate the implications of temporal shifts in accrual properties and operating environment for cash flow predictability . Three key insights emerge . First cash flows consistently outperform earnings in predicting future cash flows . Second accruals and its components including those capturing non articulating events have incremental predictive ability over cash flows . Third earnings ability to predict future cash flows has increased over the period 19892015 due to changes in operating environment rather than accrual properties .

@highlight We reconcile the mixed evidence in prior literature on the relative ability of earnings and cash flows in predicting future cash flows. We document that the conflicting evidence is attributable to differences in the manner in which cash flows are measured.
@highlight Operating cash flows outperform earnings in predicting future operating cash flows every year over the last two decades both in the US and internationally.
@highlight Accruals and its components including those capturing non articulating events exhibit incremental predictive ability over current operating cash flows. Thus our study sheds new light on interpreting prior research by
@highlight on accrual measurement.
@highlight Earnings ability to predict future operating cash flows is increasing over the period 19892015. However this trend is attributable to the increasing predictive ability of operating cash flows rather than accruals.
@highlight Shortening operating cycles decreasing levels of non cash working capital and increasing intensity of intangibles over time explain the increasing trend in cash flow predictability.
