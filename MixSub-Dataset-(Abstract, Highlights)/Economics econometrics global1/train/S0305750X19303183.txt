 Learning and accountability in foreign aid require project comparisons but the dominant framework for aid evaluation institutionalizes inconsistency . Today most aid evaluations are organized in terms of the Development Assistance Committee criteria relevance effectiveness efficiency impact and sustainability . Usually the evaluators determine how to apply each criterion . Also with donor agencies organizing their own evaluation systems project monitoring tends to be weak and many evaluations are superficial positively biased and or poorly timed . Logically the most effective way to improve learning and accountability would be to implement independent and consistent evaluation for cost effectiveness . We substantiate and illustrate this argument by explaining why evaluation should be oriented to cost effectiveness and how this could be accomplished by an evaluation association and by discussing six evaluations of health projects and several documents that summarize many evaluations .

@highlight A significant body of evidence suggests that evaluations of foreign aid projects are often positively biased.
@highlight Learning and accountability particularly at portfolio level depend on consistent measures of impacts and cost effectiveness.
@highlight The currently dominant evaluation approach in foreign aid based on the DAC criteria makes consistent measures less likely.
@highlight An evaluation association could establish and defend standards and conventions for estimating impacts and cost effectiveness.
@highlight The paper illustrates strengths weaknesses and possible improvements with examples from several health projects.
