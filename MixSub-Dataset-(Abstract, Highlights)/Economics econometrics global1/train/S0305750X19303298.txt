 High economic cost of climate policy has attracted critical debate since the Kyoto Protocol . However reliable empirical evidence of the abatement cost of green house gases across countries remains scant . In this study we estimate the average yearly green house gas abatement costs per capita for a panel of 28 OECD countries in years 19902015 . The marginal abatement costs are estimated using a novel data driven approach based on convex quantile regression . Compared to traditional frontier estimation methods the quantile approach takes into account a broader set of abatement options and is more robust to inefficiency noise and heteroscedasticity in empirical data . The comparison of OECD countries shows that the actual abatement cost per capita has been very modest much lower than predicted in the late 1990s . This result has profound policy implications calling for more ambitious climate change mitigation strategy in the future .
