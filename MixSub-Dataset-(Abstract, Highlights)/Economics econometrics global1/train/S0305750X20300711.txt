 We examine the effect of economic globalisation on income redistribution and hypothesise that it depends on ethnic fractionalisation . In highly fractionalised countries powerful ethnicities are able to extract globalisation induced benefits whereas their governments face substantial political obstacles when redistributing income between ethnic groups . Using the newly constructed KOF Globalisation Index we find supportive evidence for the interactive effect of ethnic fractionalisation and de jure financial globalisation on redistribution . In particular the total effect of de jure financial globalisation on redistribution is negative in highly fractionalised countries . Governments in these countries are apparently not only reluctant to offset potential consequences stemming from de jure financial globalisation but they even reduce redistribution to lower levels .

@highlight The effect of globalisation on redistribution is conditional on the degree of ethnic fractionalisation.
@highlight In highly fractionalised countries governments face substantial political obstacles to redistribute.
@highlight More fractionalised countries redistribute on average less as a reaction to de jure financial globalisation.
@highlight Our sample consists of 62 countries and eight 5 year periods covering 19752014.
