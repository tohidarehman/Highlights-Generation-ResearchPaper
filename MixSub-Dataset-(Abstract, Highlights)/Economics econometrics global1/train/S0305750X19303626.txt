 Humanitarian food aid has long been considered to be an effective tool towards conflict mitigation among donors and policymakers . Within the Sustainable Development Goals that have the objectives of ending hunger before 2030 and bringing peace and justice humanitarian food assistance may play a critical role in delivering progress in developing countries . However there have been growing concerns that it may actually have counter intended effects by aggravating civil conflicts in recipient countries . We estimate the effect of humanitarian food aid on civil conflict using a sample of 79 recipient countries between 2002 and 2017 . Our analysis exploits cross sectional and time variation in between country humanitarian food aid displacements . Our baseline instrumental variables estimates imply that a 10 percent increase in humanitarian food aid per capita decreases the incidence of civil conflict by about 0.2 percentage point . Humanitarian food aid also decreases the incidence of small scale and large scale civil conflicts and the onset and duration of civil conflicts .
