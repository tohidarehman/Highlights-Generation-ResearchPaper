 Water availability is paramount for security and development yet many countries suffer from water scarcity . Virtual water trade or trade in water embedded agricultural commodities has been considered a means for countries to overcome water deficits provided they can import food rather than produce locally . Despite a rich literature research on the subject has not reached a consensus on whether virtual water trade is actually driven by relative water endowment differentials or by comparative advantage in water utilization . Understanding what drives virtual water trade would support water management policies in targeting the roots of water depletion excessive use due to lack of other available inputs and bad water management due to absence of water use regulation . Using panel data of bilateral virtual water trade flows from 1994 to 2007 applied to a gravity model we first demonstrate that arid countries do resort to trade as a means to alleviate water scarcity . Second we demonstrate that there is much inefficiency in water use in some countries where other agricultural inputs are available and cheap . Given the increased urgency related to global water scarcity our results suggest how agricultural production and trade could help countries preserve and better use precious water resources .

@highlight Water scarce countries are net importers of food thus alleviating local water scarcity and saving water globally.
@highlight From 1994 to 2007 food trade resulted in saving 25 of global water resources mostly through cereal trade.
@highlight Food trade flows from countries with relatively higher water productivity.
@highlight As relative productivity grows however the relationship is inversed.
@highlight There is inefficiency in water resource use in some countries where other agricultural inputs are cheap.
