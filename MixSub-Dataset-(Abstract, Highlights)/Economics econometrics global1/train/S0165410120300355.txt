 Managers almost always define non GAAP earnings to exclude the effects of acquisition and restructuring expenses the amortization of intangibles and impairments . I find that managers with a history of reporting non GAAP earnings act as if they place lower weight on these excluded expenses when making real activities and accounting choices . They pursue more and larger acquisitions have higher total capital investment are more likely to restructure and are more likely to recognize discretionary impairments . In a difference in differences setting I find that non GAAP reporting firms are less likely to alter their restructuring activities following a significant change in accounting rules for restructuring expense recognition . Finally in supplementary analyses I find that non GAAP reporting firms tend to repeat these real activities and accounting choices year after year resulting in more persistent special item expenses .
