 Based on a linear provision charge off association and V shaped scatterplots of these variables against nonperforming loan changes Basu etal . argue that nonperforming loan changes mis measure credit quality and linear provision models are mis specified . They conclude that residual asymmetry controlling for charge offs results from loan heterogeneity and the real estate crisis . Using additions to nonaccruals to measure credit quality we find a linear association with provisions that controlling for charge offs induces misspecification and no evidence of provision asymmetry . These results highlight the importance of basing hypotheses and causal models on theoretical underpinnings rather than on plots subject to known fallacies .

@highlight We examine the Basu et al. 2020 conclusion that controlling for net charge offs addresses measurement error in nonperforming loan changes as a measure of credit quality and that residual provision asymmetry results from loan heterogeneity and the real estate crisis.
@highlight Using additions to nonaccruals to measure credit quality we find a linear association with provisions that controlling for charge offs induces misspecification and no evidence of provision asymmetry.
@highlight Linear timeliness models without controlling for charge offs produce results more highly correlated with models using additions to nonaccruals to measure credit quality suggesting these models are preferable absent the nonaccrual additions variable.
@highlight Controlling for charge offs in provision models results in a substantially greater increase in false negatives than reduction in false positives in detecting accounting discretion.
@highlight Our results highlight the importance of basing hypotheses and causal models on theoretical underpinnings rather than on plots subject to known fallacies.
