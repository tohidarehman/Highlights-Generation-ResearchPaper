 This article examines how final product trade with China shapes and interacts with labor market imperfections that create market power in labor markets and prevent an efficient market outcome . I develop a framework for measuring such labor market power distortions in monetary terms and document large degrees of these distortions in Germany s manufacturing sector . Import competition only exerts labor market disciplining effects if firms rather than employees possess labor market power . Otherwise increasing export demand and import competition both fortify existing distortions which decreases labor market efficiency . This widens the gap between potential and realized output and thus diminishes classical gains from trade .

@highlight Germany s manufacturing sector displays large labor market power distortions.
@highlight Final product trade tends to increase existing levels of firms and employees labor market power.
@highlight Increase of labor market power levels through trade reduces classical trade gains.
