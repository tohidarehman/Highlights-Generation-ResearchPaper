 Numerous empirical studies have sought to compare corruption across regions or countries . It is however individuals who are corrupt not regions or countries . Studies of corruption should therefore investigate individual behavior . This has not been previously possible other than in survey responses on payment of bribes because of lack of data . We use individual level data from the China Corruption Conviction Databank to investigate bribe taking among officials in local government public administration and parallel Party bureaucracies . We find that bribes that officials received systematically increase with positions at higher levels of official hierarchies . Economic authority to decide on spending and regulation is associated with receiving greater bribes than being in administrative positions . Consistent with life cycle incentives entry level and retirement approaching officials take higher bribes than middle aged officials . Being more educated does not deter corruption but on the contrary is associated with taking higher bribes . Gender is not correlated with the size of the bribes taken . We link our empirical results on bribes to the theory of rent seeking in bureaucratic hierarchies .

@highlight We study corruption at the level of individual public officials.
@highlight We use novel data from the China Corruption Conviction Databank.
@highlight Officials at higher levels and with economic authority tend to take larger bribes.
@highlight Officials at entry level and approaching retirement tend to take larger bribes.
@highlight Being more educated is positively correlated with the size of the bribes taken.
