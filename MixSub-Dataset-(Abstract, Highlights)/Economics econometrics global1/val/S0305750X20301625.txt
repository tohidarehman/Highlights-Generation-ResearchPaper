 Over two centuries Colombia transferred vast quantities of public land into private hands . Much of this process was justified publicly in terms of giving land to the landless and reducing rural poverty . And yet Colombia retains one of the highest concentrations of land ownership in the world . Why Analyzing the period 19602010 we show that the effects of public land distribution across 1100 municipalities are highly heterogeneous . Where small and medium sized farms dominate land distribution increased average farm size decreased land inequality and accelerated local development . But where land was concentrated in the hands of a rural elite distributed land was diverted to bigger farms resulting in fewer small and more large farms greater plot size dispersion and lower levels of development . We explore whether these effects flow through voter turnout political competition or public expenditure and taxation . Land distribution increases turnout makes politics more competitive and increases public service provision . But landed elites use patron client ties to distort local policy and decision making to their benefit . Land distributions secondary institutional effects on the distribution of power outweigh its primary effects on the distribution of land .

@highlight Colombia granted huge tracts of public land to poor farmers since 1960.
@highlight We study the heterogeneous effects of land grants on all 1100 municipalities.
@highlight In small farmers districts inequality fell and development improved.
@highlight In elite districts land concentration and inequality rose and development fell.
@highlight How Elites use patron client ties to distort local policies to their benefit.
