 Malnutrition remains a problem across India particularly among women and children in rural areas . In response nutrition sensitive agriculture programs have emerged which promote activities such as crop diversification nutrition education and womens empowerment . While research has assessed whether NSA programs have an impact on nutrition indicators less work has examined whether such programs are equitable in distributive procedural and recognitional terms . This study investigates how one non governmental organization working through women led self help groups in eastern India has incorporated NSA practices into its traditional focus of improving cereal productivity and promoting cash crops . Given that both research sites in northern Jharkhand and eastern Madhya Pradesh have seen agricultural practices shift from more diverse traditional cropping to high yielding rice over the past decade this research examines womens responses to these new NSA promotion efforts . This 11 month study employed ethnographic methods including participant observation and 117 interviews with village women along with NGO and government workers across both sites . This analysis employed an equity framework based on the decolonial concept of cognitive justice which asserts that epistemological inequity precedes socioeconomic inequities . The findings suggest while all respondents reacted positively to the tenets of NSA promotion due to high yielding paddys labor requirements and cultural aspirations to maximize rice production many farmers were unable to adopt NSA practices robustly . While poorer farmers not growing improved paddy were better positioned to adopt NSA many were less active in SHG activities due to structural barriers and an observed lack of cognitive justice . As NSA programs are still emerging little research has detailed the ways such efforts may exacerbate or allay rural inequities . This study suggests NSA could have more impact on cropping practices and nutrition outcomes if it led with an equity approach centered on cognitive justice .

@highlight Nutrition sensitive agriculture NSA projects are increasingly common yet little research has examined its equity aspects.
@highlight Paddy transplanting which is labor and time intensive was a main barrier to adoption of NSA practices.
@highlight Not all farmers transplanted paddy and there were a cultural politics of modern paddy promoted in self help groups SHGs .
@highlight Due to recognitional and economic barriers some farmers were not active in SHG activities or shared in benefits of NSA.
@highlight For NSA programs to be more effective they should use an approach based on recognitional equity and cognitive justice.
