 Evidence suggests that major events like war or natural disasters affect risk attitudes . This paper shows that similar effects can also be associated with institutional changes such as improved property rights . Using the case of a large titling program in Peru we find that the program reduced risk aversion . The effects are sizable persistent and seem to be driven by improved security of tenure . These results highlight an understudied channel through which property rights could shape economic outcomes .

@highlight Evidence from a large urban titling program in Peru.
@highlight Improved property rights lead to a sizable and persistent reduction in risk aversion.
@highlight Effects seem to be driven at least in part by changes in background risk.
