 We examine the design and implementation of the United Nations Flash Appeal triggered in response to the highly destructive 2015 Nepal earthquake . We consider how local need and various distortions affect the proposed project number the proposed financial amount and the subsequent funding decision by aid donors . Specifically we investigate the extent to which the allocation of this humanitarian assistance follows municipalities affectedness and their physical and socio economic vulnerabilities . We then analyze potential ethnic religious and political distortions . Our results show that aid allocation is associated with geophysical estimates of the earthquake damage . Controlled for disaster impact however aid allocation shows little regard for the specific socio economic and physical vulnerabilities . It is also worrisome that the allocation of the flash appeal commitments favors municipalities dominated by higher castes and disadvantages those with a greater distance to the Nepali capital Kathmandu .
