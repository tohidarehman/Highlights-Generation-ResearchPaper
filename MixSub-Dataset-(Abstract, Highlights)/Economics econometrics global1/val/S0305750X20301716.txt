 Processes of industrialisation have long been associated with labour productivity improvements rising incomes and ultimately economic and social development . The preferred policy strategy to achieve these development objectives however remain intensely debated . A specific policy strategy of resource based industrialisation involving pre export value addition to raw materials is frequently pursued by resource rich countries in the global south . We apply the analytical framework of Global Production Network theory and its central notion of strategic coupling to the case of cocoa processing in Indonesia . Our findings demonstrate that the apparent success of an RBI policy in encouraging growth of a domestic cocoa processing sector primarily through the use of export restrictions is highly dependent on industry specific GPN dynamics . Through an assessment of downstreaming policies in Indonesia this paper provides an explanation for the success and limitations of such industrial policies in the contemporary global economy . Industry outcomes are strongly influenced by Indonesia s position within a set of globally connected networks and the alignment of national policy with the particular strategies of lead firms within these networks in a processes of strategic coupling . We further argue that the inherent importance of upstream supply within resource based industrialisation demands further attention when applying concepts of strategic coupling to this particular policy framework .

@highlight The recent resurgence in resource based industrialisation RBI policies has had variable success.
@highlight Variation in RBI outcomes is explained by the strategic coupling of regions with lead firm strategies.
@highlight Sub optimal RBI outcomes in the Indonesia cocoa sector is due to policy neglect of prevailing lead firm strategies.
@highlight Effective RBI policies require enhanced attention to the sustainability of domestic resource supplies.
