 Supermarkets have gained in importance in the food systems of many developing countries with profound implications for smallholder farmers . Several studies analyzed effects of selling to supermarkets on smallholder productivity and income . However no previous work systematically analyzed effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices even though prices are important determinants of farmers profits and livelihoods . Here we use data from smallholder vegetable growers in India to compare output prices received in supermarket and traditional market channels . We also quantify farmers transport and transaction costs in both channels . Even after controlling for quality differences prices are significantly higher in supermarket channels . Positive price effects are confirmed through hedonic price models and propensity score matching . Average effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices are in a magnitude of 20 or more . Higher farmgate prices are due to fewer intermediaries and lower transaction costs in supermarket channels . In the absence of binding contracts supermarkets also need to pay higher prices to ensure regular supply of high quality vegetables . These results suggest that the rise of supermarkets can contribute to increased market efficiency with positive effects on farmgate prices and revenues .
