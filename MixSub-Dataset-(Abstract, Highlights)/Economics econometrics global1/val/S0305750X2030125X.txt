 I estimate the effect of the minimum wage on formal wages informal wages and employment in Colombia . I exploit an unexpected increase in the real minimum wage during 1999 . My analysis combines unconditional quantile regressions with a differences in differences design . I find evidence of wage responses for wages close to the minimum wage . The increases are present in both the informal and formal sectors and are larger in the formal one . Wages around the minimum increase by around 3 percent in the formal sector for a 10 percentage points larger minimum wage incidence and by around 1 percent in the informal sector . These increases are smaller than those implied by full compliance to minimum wage policy but positive for some unaffected workers . This suggests employers partially comply with the minimum wage and use it as a reference . I find slight negative employment effects on the informal sector but not on the formal sector . The effects in the informal sector are not driven by cross sectoral effects . The results suggest the minimum wage has a direct impact on the informal labor market although they may not apply to minimum wage changes in other countries or contexts or to larger minimum wage increases .
