 The race riots that broke out in Kuala Lumpur in May 1969 triggered a national public effort to greatly reduce both Malaysias longstanding ethnic inequalities and its high incidence of poverty . This paper studies how various measures of ethnic inequality evolved since 1969 . Two conceptual distinctions are emphasized that between income inequality and polarization and that between relative and absolute inequality . Over the last 50years the poorest ethnic group the Bumiputera have had the highest growth rate of household incomes which helped assure a long term decline in relative between group inequality which substantially reduced overall income inequality . Measures of ethnic polarization moved highly synchronously with between group inequality . The differential growth rates by ethnicity were not enough to prevent rising absolute inequality given the extent of the initial ethnic disparities . Despite the progress against relative inequality Malaysias absolute disparities by ethnicity are now even larger than 50years ago . The second paper of this two part paper examines the contribution of lower relative ethnic inequality to the country s progress against poverty .
