 Given a widespread sense among donors that mainstream anti corruption reforms over the past 25years have failed to yield results there is a move towards more targeted interventions . Such interventions should in principle overcome implementation gaps and make it easier to evaluate impact supporting learning . However when interventions are narrowly targeted there is a risk that corrupt actors simply adapt shifting their focus to areas with weaker controls so that overall corruption is not reduced but merely displaced . We analyse data points from World Bank funded development aid tenders over 12years in 100 developing countries and observe the heterogeneous effects of a 2003 anti corruption reform aimed at increasing oversight and opening up competition . Our tight matching estimations suggest that the reform is effective in the targeted area it decreases corruption risks due to low competition . But we also find that evasive tactics largely cancel out these positive direct effects buyers switch to non treated less competitive procedure types and exploit them more intensively . Our results demonstrate how data analytics can be used to observe public procurement at the system level to inform more adaptive and effective anti corruption programming . More broadly we underline that technical interventions might not represent the best way to tackle systemic corruption instead strategies should target the root causes of corruption and contribute to building a culture of integrity .

@highlight We analyse a reform of World Bank procurement rules using global contract level data.
@highlight The reform made bidding more competitive but insider firms retained market share.
@highlight Government officials evaded the reform by concentrating corruption on non treated processes.
@highlight Reformers should plan for evasive strategies and monitor behaviour beyond the target area.
@highlight Anti corruption reforms fail if they ignore political and social drivers of corruption.
