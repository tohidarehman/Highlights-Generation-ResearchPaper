 Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban slums areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security . This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize . Yet the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood . While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps . Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility . We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities . To address the limitations inherent in cross sectional data we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data neighborhood focus group data longitudinal satellite data and in depth qualitative interviews . While no one analysis is definitive on its own all of these results point to the same conclusion slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class . Movement out of neighborhoods particularly to non slum neighborhoods is rare . Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level and as opportunities increase volatility increases in parallel . Plateauing and volatility are features present in low end and even more in high end slums . Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility .

@highlight Slums develop at different rates but most do not convert to formal areas over time.
@highlight Movement out of slums is limited and people rarely move out to non slum areas.
@highlight Many slum households experience upward mobility but the level plateaus.
@highlight Volatility is high in slums upward gains remain precarious for slum residents.
