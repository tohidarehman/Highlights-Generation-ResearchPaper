 This paper investigates the effects of crop biodiversity on farm income and production risk using a large panel dataset of rural households in Kenya . We consider three different metrics of in situ crop diversification . We apply a partial moments based model to test the effects of each strategy on welfare defined as expected crop income variability and downside risk . Our comprehensive econometric approach differentiates climatic shocks weather and climate change . The results suggest that the benefits from greater diversification in terms of enhanced land productivity and lower production costs could surpass the foregone benefit from greater efficiency associated with more concentrated production systems . Crop richness and evenness each reduce exposure to crop income risk especially for more vulnerable farmers who produce below the expected revenue threshold . Farmers who rely on greater crop specialization on the contrary are more exposed to crop income risk .

@highlight Past climate shocks strongly influence crop diversification decisions among smallholder farmers in Kenya.
@highlight Diversification strategies that enhance crop counts per farm richness positively affect crop income.
@highlight Both crop richness and crop proportional abundance evenness mitigate risk.
@highlight Greater crop richness and especially crop evenness decrease risk of lower crop income while crop specialization increases income variability
@highlight Crop richness and evenness each reduce exposure to risk especially for more vulnerable farmers producing below the expected revenue threshold
