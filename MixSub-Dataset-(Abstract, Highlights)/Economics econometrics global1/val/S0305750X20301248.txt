 Over the past decade academic and policy communities have given significant attention to the potential connections between climate change and conflict . While the degree to which climate change alters conflict outcomes remains a topic of considerable debate in academic communities policy organizations are already being tasked with incorporating climate conflict into policy and programming . This article investigates how climate conflict discourses inform development policy and in turn how the structures of development enable or constrain institutions ability to address climate conflict priorities . Drawing upon mixed methods and multi sited data collection including nine months of participant observation interviews a survey of local government officials and a document review I investigated the ways in which development practitioners seek to address climate conflict . Data collection focused on two particular programs being implemented by Mercy Corps an international humanitarian and development NGO in Karamoja Uganda a region emerging from a period of violent conflict manifesting largely between ethnically defined pastoralist groups . In examining how the wider discourses of climate conflict inform these programs I demonstrate why there exists such a wide disparity between the demand for development programming that addresses the conflict risks of climate change and the distinct lack of clarity regarding what such programming might entail . More specifically I identify the following overlapping challenges facing development agencies seeking to address climate conflict complex spatial scales across disconnected geographies imprecise and limiting discursive framings and challenges related to program governance . In addition to identifying these barriers I also demonstrate that clearer paths for development intervention emerge when the narrow conceptualizations of climate conflict are widened beyond climate changes role as a driver of conflict or threat multiplier .

@highlight The discourse that frames climate change as athreat multiplier hinders conceptualizations of climate conflict interventions.
@highlight The spatial disparity between climatic impacts and conflict outcomes does not align with traditional development structures.
@highlight The structures of development and divergent temporalities of climate conflict complicate agencies implementation capacities.
@highlight Interventions that expand beyond diagnosing climate change as a conflict driver better account for implementation barriers.
