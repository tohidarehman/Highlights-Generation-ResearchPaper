 For most poor countries of today using agriculture for development is widely recognized as a promising strategy . Yet in these countries investment in agriculture has mostly been lagging relative to international norms and recommendations . Current wisdom on how to use agriculture for development is that it requires asset building for smallholder farmers productivity growth in staple foods an agricultural transformation and a rural transformation . This sequence has too often been hampered by extensive market and government failures . We outline a theory of change where the removal of market and government failures to use this Agriculture for Development strategy can be addressed through two contrasted and complementary approaches . One is from the supply side where public and social agents intervene to help farmers overcome the major constraints to adoption liquidity risk information and access to markets . The other is from the demand side where private agents create incentives for smallholder farmers to modernize through contracting and vertical coordination in value chains . We review the extensive literature that has explored ways of using Agriculture for Development through these two approaches . We conclude by noting that the supply side approach has benefited from extensive research but met with limited success . The demand side approach has promise but received insufficient attention and is in need of additional rigorous research which we outline .

@highlight We review how agriculture based countries can use agriculture for development.
@highlight An Agriculture for Development sequence aims at asset building productivity growth agricultural rural transformations.
@highlight Critical instruments for success are constraint removal on technology adoption and development of inclusive value chains.
@highlight These instruments can be used from the supply side with public agents and from the demand side with private agents.
@highlight While the supply side has been extensively researched the demand side is less explored and we offer a research agenda.
