 In Vietnam rapid deforestation until the 1980s was followed by a period of widespread reforestation . Acclaimed as the first forest transition in Southeast Asia this turn around resulted from major environmental socio economic policy changes successes in agriculture and plantation forestry and state led efforts in upland forest protection restoration . We investigated forest trends after new shifts in forest governance towards more commodity production orientation underlining that recent advances are not irreversible . Using official provincial data and applying multivariate statistics we elicited major factors influencing cover changes of two types of physical forests in relation with changes in political forestlands of contrasting types comparing periods before and after the introduction of Payments for Forest Ecosystem Services policies . We find that a forest transition only continues if the tree plantation boom is factored into forest change . Country wide natural forest cover decreased slightly since 2006 with however regionally differentiated trends northern increases

@highlight Notions of forest transition in Vietnam imply a long term trend towards a stable forest cover.
@highlight New forest policies in Vietnam largely concentrate on fostering economic productivity.
@highlight Renewed deforestation has been linked to policy driven decreases in protection forestlands.
@highlight Until now payment for forest ecosystem service policies had no visible effect to counter forest loss.
@highlight Aspects of good governance are important for a sustainable transition in forestry.
