 As Indias population has been ageing due to declines in fertility and mortality rates more policy emphasis has been placed on reducing poverty among the elderly . The present study aims to examine the effect of Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme on household welfare indicators such as consumption expenditure income assets and poverty . Using the household longitudinal data based on the India Human Development Survey in 20045 and 201112 we have applied the Propensity Score Matching to build a counterfactual group and have used the propensity score weighted fixed effects model to eliminate time invariant unobservable household characteristics . The results show that the IGNOAPS participation increased consumption expenditure food and non food expenditure and assets while reducing the household labour supply . The sub sample estimations show that these effects are observed only when recipients are women . However the results of Difference in Difference model imply that the poverty reducing effect deteriorated in 201112 after the government made several changes to programme specifications in 2007 . This was likely because some households which accessed IGNOAPS after 2007 reduced the labour supply significantly while keeping the level of consumption .

@highlight This paper finds that participation in IGNOAPS has a strong positive effect on various household welfare dimensions.
@highlight Welfare dimensions studied here includes monthly consumption expenditure food non food expenditures and household assets.
