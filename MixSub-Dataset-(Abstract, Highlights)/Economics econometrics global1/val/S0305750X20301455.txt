 This article examines post 2011 transformations of economic governance in the MENA region . It argues that Arab regimes have responded to the threats posed by the 2011 uprisings not by embracing appeals for inclusive social contracts but through the imposition of repressive exclusionary social pacts in which previously universal economic and social rights of citizens are being redefined as selective benefits . These pacts are shown to represent a significant shift in economic governance and in state society relations in the MENA region evident in the growing institutionalization of contingent citizenship as a framework for the organization of state society relations and the management of social policy . In stressing discontinuities in economic governance this argument challenges claims that the reassertion of authoritarianism in Arab states after 2011 represents a back to the future process exhibiting little change from the formally inclusive social pacts associated with pre 2011 models of authoritarian governance .

@highlight These pacts express contingent conceptions of citizenship and securitize economic governance.
@highlight The transition to repressive exclusionary social pacts is a significant shift in authoritarian norms and practices in MENA.
@highlight This shift forecloses possibilities for establishing inclusive participatory social contracts in the MENA region.
