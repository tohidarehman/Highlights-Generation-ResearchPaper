 Violence against children and adolescents a highly prevalent problem is a clear violation of child rights and has detrimental effects on later life outcomes . Programs that alleviate poverty address a structural determinant of child vulnerability and can thereby reduce child abuse . This paper investigates whether the Government of Zimbabwes Harmonized Social Cash Transfer Program which combines cash transfers with complementary services affects youth exposure to physical violence . The analysis uses data from a non experimental impact evaluation and a difference in differences approach . Results show a 19 percentage point decline in the incidence of physical violence among youth four years into the program . HSCT induced enhancements in beneficiary households purchasing capacity and food security improvements in caregiver subjective well being and reductions in youth participation in economic work for pay could be mediating the programs effects on youth abuse . This paper adds to the relatively scarce evidence on the impacts of anti poverty policies on young peoples susceptibility to physical violence in developing countries .
