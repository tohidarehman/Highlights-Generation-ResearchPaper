 Expatriate workers remittances represent an important source of financing for low and middle income countries . No consensus however has yet emerged regarding the effect of remittances on economic growth . In a quantitative survey of 538 estimates reported in 95 studies we find that approximately 40 of the studies report a positive effect 40 report no effect and 20 report a negative effect . Our results indicate publication bias in favor of positive effects . Correcting for the bias using recently developed techniques we find that the mean effect of remittances on growth is still positive but economically small . Nevertheless our results uncover noticeable regional differences remittances are growth enhancing in Asia but not in Africa . Studies that do not control for alternative sources of external finance such as foreign aid and foreign direct investment mismeasure the effect of remittances . Finally time series studies and studies ignoring endogeneity issues report systematically larger effects of remittances on growth .
