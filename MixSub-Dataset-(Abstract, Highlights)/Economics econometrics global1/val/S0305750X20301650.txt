 Over the last 50years Malaysia has seen one of the fastest rates of income poverty reduction in the world . This came alongside falling overall income inequality due in large part to a national policy effort to address ethnic inequalities in the wake of tragic race riots in 1969 . The first paper in the two part series examined various measures of ethnic inequality . This second paper assesses the role that changes in between group inequality played in Malaysias success against poverty . To address this question a new decomposition method is applied to survey data spanning 50years . The results indicate that ethnic redistribution helped reduce poverty but it was not as important as within group redistribution or mean income growth . A pure ethnic redistribution effect is defined and isolated empirically . Sizable potential gains to the countrys poor from ethnic redistribution are revealed in the 1970s suggesting that the early policy effort made sense . The absolute gains have faded over time and are now small though the elasticity of national poverty to ethnic redistribution remains quite high .

@highlight However it was not as important as within group redistribution or mean income growth.
@highlight The absolute gains to poor people from ethnic redistribution were once high but have faded.
