 The aim of this paper is to examine theoretically and empirically the impact of improvement in the capability to access innovation and knowledge on economic growth and convergence among countries . Our results obtained using an augmented Solow Swan growth model and panel data methodology with a sample of 138 countries for the period 19902014 show not only that improvement in the capability to access innovation and knowledge has a positive impact on said economic growth fostering the technological catch up process for developing countries and accelerating the pattern of economic convergence but also that this improvement has an even greater effect on developing countries when democracy is well developed accelerating the pattern of economic convergence even further .

@highlight Improved capability to access innovation and knowledge has a positive and significant effect on economic growth.
@highlight It also fosters technological catch up process for developing countries and promotes economic convergence.
@highlight Economic convergence is even greater when democracy is well developed in developing countries.
@highlight Leapfrogging Hypothesis holds since the impact is greater in developing countries.
