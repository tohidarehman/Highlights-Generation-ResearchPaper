 The dramatic increase in overweight obesity prevalence in India and the concomitant increase in nutrition related non communicable diseases present critical health policy challenges . This paper analyses two successive nationally representative household datasets the 201516 and 200506 National Family Health Survey rounds to discern the extent of shifts in overweight obesity prevalence underway in India and the implications for informing policy . Unique features of the study are the focus given to analysing overweight obesity across different sub populations based on gender rurality and socio economic status and the diverse pattern of the prevalence across individual states over time . A fixed effects model using state time interactions is used to analyse state level variations and time dependent effects across particular sub populations . Despite the considerable increase in the prevalence of overweight obesity over the past decade and a degree of convergence across population cohorts the results show that this has been accompanied by considerable variation and divergence between states . Our findings reveal that a select few economically advanced states most noticeably for wealthy urban female cohorts experienced negative time dependent effects where the predicted rates of overweight obesity declined over the decade . However some less developed and more populous states experienced positive time dependent effects such that by 201516 they had attained overweight obesity rates that had overtaken those of richer states . Also interestingly beyond a particular threshold education exhibits a negative relationship in the likelihood of overweight obesity for females but not for males . Policymakers need to understand the driving factors underpinning the state level differences and the changing patterns across cohorts over time and to formulate regionallybased policies that specifically target these differences rather than pursue a single policy approach . Moreover Indias health system needs to be re orientated to manage burgeoning chronic disease conditions and to address the burden placed on the poor given that such health expenditure is mostly privately incurred .

@highlight Many lesser developed states attained predicted overweight obesity prevalences that have overtaken some richer states.
@highlight For some more developed states wealthy urban female cohorts experienced a decline in the overweight obesity prevalence.
@highlight Education for females shows a negative threshold effect with overweight obesity but this was not observed for males.
@highlight The high overweight obesity prevalence among the poorer and populous states indicates a major health crisis is looming.
@highlight Policymakers must formulate policies that target state level differences rather than pursue a blanket approach.
