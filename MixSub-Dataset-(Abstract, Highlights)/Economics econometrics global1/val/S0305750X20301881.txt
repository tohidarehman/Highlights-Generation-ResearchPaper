 Encouraging farmers to adopt pro environmental production is vital to the promotion of sustainable agriculture . Previous observational studies emphasize the importance of economic incentives and information access to farmers decision making processes however due to endogeneity issues little strong causal evidence is available . This study makes an original contribution by experimentally examining the impacts of the 50 price subsidy and information treatments on farmers adoption of organic fertilizer . A short video sharing the experience of farmers who have applied organic fertilizer is selected as our information treatment . We analyze data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with 1287 small scale tea farmers in Vietnam . We find significant impacts of both the information and 50 price subsidy treatments . Moreover the effect of the former is approximately one third that of the latter . Subgroup treatment analysis also reveals that the information treatment performs well for members of certification groups . Thus to induce farmers to adopt pro environmental production behaviors information treatment can partially substitute for subsidies to reduce the burden on the public budget .

@highlight We examine the effect of an information treatment via peer farmers and a 50 price subsidy treatment on organic fertilizer adoption.
@highlight We conduct a randomized controlled trial with 1287 tea cultivating farmers in Vietnam.
@highlight Both treatments have significant impacts on farmers adoption of organic fertilizer.
@highlight The information treatment is approximately one third as effective as the subsidy treatment.
@highlight The information treatment performs well for members of certification groups.
