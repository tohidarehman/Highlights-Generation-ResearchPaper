 In India the government launched a US 22.6 billion financial support package for the poor and marginalized as a result of Covid 19 . Approximately US 4.2 billion came from a vast pile of unspent social special purpose funds . How and why did such a large volume of funds accumulate in the first place and why did it take a public health emergency to release them What might be the consequences of their use under such emergency conditions especially for our understanding of governance and accountability in social welfare provision

@highlight Billions of dollars collected by the Indian government for the benefit of poor and marginalised social groups remain unspent.
@highlight Covid 19 has resulted in the emergency use of some unspent monies but not always for the benefit of those social groups.
@highlight There is weak accountability in India for both the non spending and emergency spending of these monies.
@highlight Non spending and emergency spending of these monies are institutional and political phenomena.
@highlight Covid 19 social funds in India and elsewhere should ensure accountability for the flow and distribution of money.
