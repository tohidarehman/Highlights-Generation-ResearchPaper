 Indias progressive Right to Information Act is a global model . The RTIA was adopted a decade and a half ago to serve as a check on corruption and to advance democracy citizen equity and public accountability . Little primary research has been conducted on the implementation of the RTIA . This research employs a socio political and technocratic framework to study influences on RTIA implementation over time from the citizen requester demand side and the governmental supply side from an institutional development process perspective . Our constructivist approach utilizes in depth semi structured interviews from frequent information requesters and information commissioners
