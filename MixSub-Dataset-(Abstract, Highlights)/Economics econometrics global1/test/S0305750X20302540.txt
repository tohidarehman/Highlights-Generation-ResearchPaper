 Burkina Fasos 2008 Bt cotton adoption was Africas largest genetically modified crop introduction principally for small farmers and became its most celebrated success story . In 2016 however Burkina Faso announced an abrupt phase out of Bt cotton citing millions of dollars of losses due to inferior lint quality . In hindsight quality issues were conspicuously absent from the success narrative particularly given that cotton sector actors were aware of problems for a decade . Recent data also reveal significantly lower yield gains and substantial inequalities between farmers further questioning the success story and the evaluation literature it relied upon . Why and how was such a faulty and incomplete success narrative produced and promoted To answer this we draw on extended fieldwork conducted over ten years in Burkina Faso to critically examine how the knowledge used to build this success narrative was produced . We first scrutinize the evaluation literature pointing out flaws and blindspots in the methodologies and reporting of findings . We then extend our analysis drawing on political ecology and critical science studies to focus on the power relations of knowledge production . We focus on three themes and show how the political economic context favored the production of positive results with Monsanto holding substantial power over the evaluation process the narrow epistemologies of agronomic evaluation produced apolitical knowledge that overlooked how local level power dynamics shaped data collection and in at least two cases the returns accrued by smaller scale Bt cotton farmers the knowledge produced via these processes was used to accrue material benefits to Monsanto and helped to promote GM crops across the continent . We conclude that future GM crop evaluations should be more self reflexive critical and transparent in how power shapes the evaluation process and agricultural outcomes for differentiated farmers .

@highlight Burkina Fasos Bt cotton success story relied on a narrow set of evaluation studies.
@highlight Monsanto exerted significant influence on these Bt cotton evaluations.
@highlight Evaluation studies overlooked how local level power dynamics shape farmer outcomes.
@highlight Studies inflated benefits and hid differential impacts by ignoring inequalities.
@highlight Favorable evaluations benefitted Monsanto and promoted GM crops across Africa.
