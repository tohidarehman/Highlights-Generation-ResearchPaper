 On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the CGIAR this paper revisits the genesis of the international center model for agricultural research . This model became fashionable in the 1960s and was arguably the major institutional innovation of the 20th century for foreign assistance to agriculture . While the founding of the first IARCs is universally attributed to the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations we argue that based on new evidence the creation of the IARCs was a logical conclusion of a process involving many actors that began immediately after World War I . First we review FAO efforts to build regional and global research networks for the major cereals in the immediate post WWII period . These networks linked closely to USDA and its legacy of scientific collaboration across US states that together with the Foundations strongly influenced the design of the first two international centers for the major cereals . In Latin America the various efforts by the US National Academy of Sciences the US government and the countries of the region resulted in the creation of three centers for tropical agriculture with a broader research focus on farming systems and natural resources . Finally we show how the establishment of four IARCs in Africa in different ways drew on a colonial legacy that had moved toward centralization of research across colonial territories since before WWII . All of these efforts over many decades involved a good deal of experimentation in organization funding and governance to arrive at the standard IARC model that emerged . By the late 1960s the genesis of another six IARCs was already in place stimulating the creation of the CGIAR to fund and coordinate the IARCs . The review concludes with a brief reflection on the successes and challenges of the IARC model over 50years and its relevance today .

@highlight The CGIAR was created in 1971 and the IARCs became a major institutional innovation for development assistance.
@highlight The invention of the IARC has been attributed to US Foundations starting in Mexico in 1943.
@highlight This review uses new sources to identify the role of many other actors in developing the IARC model starting from the 1920s.
@highlight The IARCs inherited a proven model of crop research but have struggled with a model and stable funding for NRM.
@highlight Core elements of the IARC model remain relevant today but require further evolution especially integration as a system.
