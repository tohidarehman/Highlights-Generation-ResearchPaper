 Despite the firm consensus that income inequality is intrinsically undesirable its impact on economic growth is much disputed . We posit that the relationship between income inequality and economic growth is conditioned by the level of equality of opportunity . Our testable hypothesis is simple in societies where opportunities are unequally distributed where the material circumstances of parents act as binding constraints on the opportunities available to their children income inequality exerts a greater drag on future growth . In contrast in societies with a more equal distribution of opportunities an increase in income inequality can be more easily reversed and need not constrain investment opportunities and growth . We identify equality of opportunity with intergenerational mobility that is the degree of the correlation between parents attainments and childrens attainments . We use several recently developed internationally comparable measures of intergenerational mobilityincluding the World Banks comprehensive GDIM databaseto confirm that the negative impact of income inequality on growth is higher the lower is intergenerational mobility . Our results suggest that omitting intergenerational mobility leads to misspecification shedding light on why the empirical literature on income inequality and growth has been so inconclusive .

@highlight We use a new dataset on intergenerational mobility in income and education.
@highlight We revisit the relationship between income inequality and economic growth.
@highlight The negative impact of inequality is higher the lower is intergenerational mobility.
@highlight The results are robust including to the use of instrumental variables.
