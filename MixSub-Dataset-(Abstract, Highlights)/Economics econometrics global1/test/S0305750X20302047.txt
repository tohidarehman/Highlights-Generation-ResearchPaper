 We adopt a complementary methods approach to investigate whether and how heterogeneity in individual returns to a public good affects public good provision . We engage smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka in a one shot framed lab in the field experiment within which the farmers rates of return to the public good are exogenously varied and a survey including a question about the farmers willingness to contribute time to the construction of a specific hypothetical public good the return from which for a given farmer would depend on his or her circumstances in everyday life . In the former we find weak evidence that heterogeneity in individual returns increases contributions . In the latter we find that those facing a higher return would contribute more but no evidence that heterogeneity has an effect either way at the group level . We conclude that heterogeneity in returns does not explain why collective action remains a challenge in farming communities in developing countries . From a methodological point of view we find that using complementary methods provides a more balanced account of communities potential engagement in public good provision

@highlight Heterogeneity in individual returns does not explain why provision remains a challenge.
@highlight Those expecting a high return step up and those expecting a low return do not step down.
@highlight Behavioural and survey data show interventions not compromised by low expected returns.
@highlight Mixing methods yields more balanced insights concerning behaviour in the field.
