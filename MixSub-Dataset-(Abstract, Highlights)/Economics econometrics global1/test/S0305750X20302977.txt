 The map presented in this brief note summarizes regional differences in population age structures between the NUTS 3 regions of Europe in the context of unequal age and sex specific death risks associated with the spread of the COVID 19 pandemic . Since older people are exposed to much higher death risks older populations are expected to face much more difficult challenges coping with the pandemic . The urban rural dimension turns out to be very important as the remote rural areas are also the oldest . In the map NUTS 3 regions of Europe are colored according to the deviation from European pooled estimate of the proportion of population at risk of death due to COVID 19 . We assume that 5 6 of the populations get infected and experience age specific infection fatality ratios modelled by the Imperial College COVID 19 Response Team . We adjust IFRs by sex ratios of age specific case fatality ratios observed in the European countries that are included in the COVerAGE DB . Thus we effectively introduce a summary measure of population age structures focused on the most vulnerable to the pandemic . Such an estimate for the total European population is 1 . The map reflects the unequal population age structures rather than the precise figures on COVID 19 fatality . It is a case if scenario that highlights the possible effect of the population age structures a demographic perspective . This analysis clearly shows the contribution of regional differences in population age structures to the magnitude of the pandemic other things equal we expect to see a four fold variation in average regional infection fatality ratios across Europe due only to differences in the population structures .

@highlight European regions are ageing unequally.
@highlight The COVID 19 pandemic is hardest in the elderly populations.
@highlight Population age structures may account for four fold variation in IFRs across Europe.
