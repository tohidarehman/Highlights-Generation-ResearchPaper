 We analyse minute level multi dimensional information flows within and between bitcoin spot and derivatives . We show that perpetual swaps and futures traded on the unregulated exchanges Huobi OKEx and BitMEX are much the strongest instruments for bitcoin price discovery and we examine potential determinants of their leadership strength . Prices on the regulated CME bitcoin futures and the US based spot exchanges react to rather than lead price movements on the unregulated exchanges and they may do so relatively slowly . In a multi dimensional setting including the main price leaders within futures perpetuals and spot markets the CME futures have a very minor effect on price discovery even less than the spot exchanges Bitfinex Bitstamp and Coinbase . Our findings highlight the persistent problems stemming from inconsistent regulation in bitcoin spot and derivatives markets including insufficient price stability and lack of resistance to manipulative trading . We conclude that the SEC are correct to maintain such issues as their main concern for bitcoin ETF applications .

@highlight Previous research on bitcoin price discovery omits the most important price leading instruments.
@highlight Derivatives products traded on three large unregulated crypto exchanges strongly dominate price discovery within the bitcoin market.
@highlight The information leadership of the unregulated Huobi futures appears to be caused by speculative traders. However when volatility increases the BitMEX perpetual contract which is best for hedging becomes more influential.
@highlight The CME bitcoin futures contribute far even less than the major bitcoin spot exchanges contrasting previous research presented to the SEC for bitcoin ETF applications.
@highlight Our findings highlight the insufficient stability and resistance of the bitcoin market against manipulation inhibiting its evolution towards a mainstream asset class.
