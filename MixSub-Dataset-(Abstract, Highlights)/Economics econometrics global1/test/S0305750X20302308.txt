 The expansion of large scale non discretionary social policy has been one of the most important policy innovations in Latin America in recent decades . While these benefits have reduced the political manipulation of low income citizens discretionary social programswhose distribution follows opaque criteria and are often allocated according to political considerationscontinue to exist . Employing an original survey in Mexico we explore how citizens both beneficiaries and non beneficiaries experience and perceive access to discretionary social programs . While the literature on clientelism emphasizes the distribution of discretionary benefits by party agents in exchange for electoral support a number of recent studies have found that access to discretionary social benefits can also operate through community associations or interest organizations . We conducted a list experiment in our survey to detect whether in the experience or perception of the respondent social benefits are allocated on the basis of partisan campaign support or organizational participation . Our findings reveal that organizational brokerage is at least as important as the much studied role of party mediated clientelism for access to discretionary benefits .
