 Developing countries are highly vulnerable to the COVID 19 pandemic in part due to the lack of international support for ensuring progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals . Yet the mounting financial burden faced by all countries means that additional support is unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future . It is critical that developing countries find innovative policy mechanisms to achieve sustainability and development aims in a cost effective manner . This requires identifying affordable policies that can yield immediate progress towards several SDGs together and aligns economic incentives for longer term sustainable development . We identify three policies that meet these criteria a fossil fuel subsidy swap to fund clean energy investments and dissemination of renewable energy in rural areas reallocating irrigation subsidies to improve water supply sanitation and wastewater infrastructure and a tropical carbon tax which is a levy on fossil fuels that funds natural climate solutions . Such innovative and cost effective policy mechanisms do not require substantial external support and they foster greater progress towards achieving the SDGs in poorer economies .

@highlight Before the pandemic progress toward some SDGs was lacking.
@highlight Post pandemic here may be less financing for attaining the SDGs.
@highlight Affordable policies that meet several SDGs simultaneously are needed.
@highlight Fossil fuel and irrigation subsidy swaps to end water and energy poverty.
@highlight Tropical carbon tax to fund natural climate solutions.
