 We study how information disclosure affects financial intermediation when the payoff to the long term investment is risky . The analysis is based on a business cycle version of the bank run model wherein a bank provides risk sharing to demand depositors who experience unobservable shocks to their liquidity preferences . The bank pre commits to the precision of an interim signal regarding the payoff to the long term investment . We examine the impact of bank disclosure on optimal risk sharing achieved by run proof signal contingent demand deposit contracts . We show that for utility functions that display non increasing absolute risk aversion more informative disclosure improves the ex ante risk sharing provided by financial intermediation .
