 Womens patterns of time use which proxy the work burdens associated with productive and reproductive activities are an important determinant of nutrition and well being in LMICs . However there is a lack of empirical evidence on how patterns of time use translate into patterns of physical activity and energy expenditure particularly in rural areas where seasonal agricultural labour plays such an important role . We address this gap by integrating energy expenditure data derived from wearable tri axial accelerometers with time use data from conventional recall based surveys . Using datasets from agricultural households in four rural communities in India and Nepal our results show that there are significant gender differences in the patterns of time use and energy expenditure . Men and women participate equally in productive work however women shoulder most of the additional reproductive work burdens in rural households at the expense of leisure opportunities . Our results provide insights into womens responses to opportunities for productive work and highlight the nature of trade offs they face .

@highlight Allocations of time and energy are important determinants of nutrition and well being but only time use is formally addressed in the literature.
@highlight We match energy expenditure and time use data from farm households in India and Nepal and examine energy use variations in relation to time use.
@highlight For the range of activities observed productive work has significantly larger energy shares than time shares for both men and women.
@highlight Men and women participate equally in productive work but women shoulder most of the reproductive work at the expense of leisure opportunities.
@highlight While time use may not be a reliable indicator of work burden results reveal some of the trade offs women face in performing competing tasks.
