 Smallholder farmers in developing countries often suffer from high risk and limited market access . Contract farming may improve the situation under certain conditions . Several studies analyzed effects of contracts on smallholder productivity and income with mixed results . Most existing studies focused on one particular contract scheme . Contract characteristics rarely differ within one scheme so little is known about how different contract characteristics may influence the benefits for smallholders . Here we address this research gap using data from oil palm farmers in Ghana who participate in different contract schemes . Some of the farmers have simple marketing contracts while others have resource providing contracts where the buyer also offers inputs and technical services on credit . A comparison group cultivates oil palm without any contract . Regression models that control for selection bias show that resource providing contracts increase farmers input use and yield . Resource providing contracts also incentivize higher levels of specialization and an increase in the scale of production . These effects are especially pronounced for small and medium sized farms . In contrast the marketing contracts have no significant effects on input use productivity and scale of production . The results suggest that resource providing contracts alleviate market access constraints while simple marketing contracts do not in this context .

@highlight Comparison of effects of marketing contracts and resource providing contracts in Ghanas palm oil sector.
@highlight Resource providing contracts increase farmers input intensity productivity and scale of production.
@highlight Effects are bigger for small and medium farms than for large scale producers.
@highlight Simple marketing contracts have no significant effects on input use and productivity.
@highlight Results help explain impact heterogeneity in the existing literature on smallholder contracting.
