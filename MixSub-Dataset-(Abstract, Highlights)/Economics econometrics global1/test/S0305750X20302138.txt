 The COVID 19 pandemic has hit at a time when microfinance is at its historical peak with an estimated 139 million microfinance customers globally . Cambodias microfinance sector is one of the fastest growing and like others in the Global South has moved from offering entrepreneurial capital to everyday liquidity and even disaster relief . In this Viewpoint however we argue that the promotion of microfinance as market based relief and recovery from the pandemic should be a source of concern not comfort . We firstly suggest that as a result of the health and economic impacts associated with COVID 19 credit taking is likely to escalate further in terms of the number of borrowers and loan amounts . Second we contend that a growing reliance on MFIs will leave households undernourished and further vulnerable to its disciplining and extractive impulses . Third we argue that the interplay between over indebtedness pre existing malnutrition challenges and the global public health crisis of COVID 19 represents a major challenge to gender equality and sustainable development . Coordination between the Cambodian government microfinance lenders international investors and development partners is vital to offer debt relief . Furthermore to reverse the reliance of so many households on the microfinance industry for survival inclusive socio economic policies and public welfare services must be prioritised .
