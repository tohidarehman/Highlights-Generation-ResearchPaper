 One of the immediate responses to COVID 19 has been a call to ban wildlife trade given the suspected origin of the pandemic in a Chinese market selling and butchering wild animals . There is clearly an urgent need to tackle wildlife trade that is illegal unsustainable or carries major risks to human health biodiversity conservation or meeting acceptable animal welfare standards . However some of the suggested actions in these calls go far beyond tackling these risks and have the potential to undermine human rights damage conservation incentives and harm sustainable development . There are a number of reasons for this concerns . First calls for bans on wildlife markets often include calls for bans on wet markets but the two are not the same thing and wet markets can be a critical underpinning of informal food systems . Second wildlife trade generates essential resources for the worlds most vulnerable people contributing to food security for millions of people particularly in developing countries . Third wildlife trade bans have conservation risks including driving trade underground making it even harder to regulate and encouraging further livestock production . Fourth in many cases sustainable wildlife trade can provide key incentives for local people to actively protect species and the habitat they depend on leading to population recoveries . Most importantly a singular focus on wildlife trade overlooks the key driver of the emergence of infectious diseases habitat destruction largely driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation and industrial livestock production . We suggest that the COVID 19 crisis provides a unique opportunity for a paradigm shift both in our global food system and also in our approach to conservation . We make specific suggestions as to what this entails but the overriding principle is that local people must be at the heart of such policy shifts .

@highlight Calls to ban wildlife trade have been a key response to COVID 19 but are not the solution.
@highlight The major drivers of the emergence of infectious diseases include habitat destruction and industrialised livestock production.
@highlight Indiscriminate wildlife trade bans risk doing more harm than good both from a conservation and development perspective.
@highlight Conservation linked responses to COVID 19 need to address the key drivers respect rights and ensure local participation in decision making.
