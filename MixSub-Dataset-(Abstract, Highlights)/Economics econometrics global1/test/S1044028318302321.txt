 We show that higher capital and liquidity ratios increase the efficiency of conventional and Islamic banks . Using conditional quantile regressions we further show that the effect is stronger for highly efficient small highly liquid and highly capitalized conventional banks . We also find that more capitalized and liquid banks were efficient during the 2008 2009 financial crisis and the Arab Spring . Our findings support the view that the constraints imposed by

@highlight Higher capital and liquidity ratios have a positive effect on the efficiency of the two bank types.
@highlight The positive effect is less pronounced for Islamic banks reflecting the existence of an efficiency gap.
@highlight Quantile regressions show that the efficiency gap tends to widen in favor of highly efficient conventional banks.
@highlight Holding higher capital and liquidity ratios might put Islamic banks at a disadvantage in terms of efficiency.
@highlight More capitalized and more liquid banks were more efficient during the global financial crisis and the Arab spring.
