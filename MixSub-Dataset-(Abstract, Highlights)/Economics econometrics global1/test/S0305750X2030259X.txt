 In the context of the major potential impacts of COVID 19 on agriculture and agricultural trade in developing countries this Viewpoint discusses the advantages of adopting a conceptual framework previously used to discuss the impact of the HIV AIDS pandemic on agriculture and rural livelihoods . The framework is made up of two pairs of linked concepts 1 Susceptibility or the chance of an individual becoming infected 2 Resistance or the ability of an individual to avoid infection 3 Vulnerability or the likelihood of significant impacts occurring at individual household or community level and 4 Resilience the active responses that enable people to avoid the worst impacts of an epidemic at different levels or to recover faster to a level accepted as normal . This framework allows the clear formulation of key questions for COVID 19 factors in the labor process itself that make people more or less susceptible broader socio economic and biophysical determinants of susceptibility factors that make farm households food enterprises and value chains more vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic and aspects of COVID 19 responses by governments and the private sector that might increase vulnerability . Brief examples of susceptibility of value chain operations and of their vulnerability to COVID 19 lockdown measures are given . A focus on resistance and resilience encourages investigation of local level responses by communities and NGOs which with appropriate monitoring and learning could be scaled up .
