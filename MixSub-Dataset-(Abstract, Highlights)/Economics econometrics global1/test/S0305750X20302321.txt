 Several countries in Africa have either deployed or considering using digital contact tracing as part of their Covid 19 containment strategy amidst calls for the use of technology to improve the efficiency of traditional contact tracing . We discuss some of the complexities entailed in using DCT in Africa . Adopting a socio technical perspective we argue that if DCT design and deployment are not well thought out it can lead to unintended consequences particularly in a continent like Africa with disproportionate levels of digital divides and other structural inequalities . We suggest that any adoption of DCT by African countries must take account of their compatibility with local resources values social structure and domestic political factors . Accordingly we propose a process of
