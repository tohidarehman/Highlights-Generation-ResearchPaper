 The first licensed dengue vaccine led to considerable controversy and to date no dengue vaccine is in widespread use . All three leading dengue vaccine candidates are live attenuated vaccines with the main difference between them being the type of backbone and the extent of chimerization . While CYD TDV does not include non structural proteins of dengue TAK 003 contains the dengue virus serotype 2 backbone and the Butantan Merck vaccine contains three full genomes of the four dengue virus serotypes . While dengue primed individuals can already benefit from vaccination against all four serotypes with the first licensed dengue vaccine CYD TDV the need for dengue naive population has not yet been met . To improve tetravalent protection sequential vaccination should be considered in addition to a heterologous prime boost approach .

@highlight As a tetravalent immune response is desired each component would need to independently result in four different monotypic immune responses that are solid to each serotype.
@highlight Plaque reduction neutralization assays do not reliably differentiate between serotype specific versus heterotypic antibodies hence identifying immune correlates remains elusive.

@highlight Sequential immunization or heterologous prime boost strategies should be considered to improve a balanced protection against all four serotypes.
