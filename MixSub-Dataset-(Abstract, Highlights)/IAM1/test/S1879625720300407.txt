 Dengue virus infects several million people each year . Although usually a self limiting disease some patients can develop life threatening severe complications characterized by plasma leakage hemorrhaging and shock . The signs and symptoms of severe disease usually arise late in the disease course when patients are recovering and fever has subsided making it difficult to predict . Efforts are underway to identify risk factors and biomarkers that can accurately predict disease severity in the acute febrile phase of the disease facilitating early intervention and treatment strategies for those at greatest risk . In this review we discuss recent advancements in identifying risk factors and biomarkers for the prognosis of severe dengue .

@highlight Biomarkers of severe dengue can potentially improve clinical dengue outcomes and alleviate the healthcare burden in dengue endemic settings.
@highlight Risk factors for severe dengue include prior DENV infection and certain pre existing conditions such as obesity hypertension and asthma.
@highlight Certain proteins and metabolites associated with inflammation including chymase are potential prognostic biomarkers of severe dengue.
@highlight Unique transcriptomic signatures identified in the blood have the potential to be utilized as prognostic markers.
@highlight Some biomarkers consistently distinguish DF and DHF DSS during the critical phase but have poor predictive capacity.
