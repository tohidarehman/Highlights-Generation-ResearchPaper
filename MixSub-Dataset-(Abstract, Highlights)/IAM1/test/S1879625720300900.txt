 Productive virus infection depends upon delivery of viral genomic material into the host cell cytoplasm . The tails of bacteriophages recognize host cells and mediate host cell wall and membrane penetration . Recent cryo electron microscopy studies have revealed near atomic resolutions structures of the entire or almost entire bacteriophage particles of model systems including phi29 P22 P68 and T4 . These structures allow comparisons between not only different states of the same phage but also between distantly related phages . In this review we summarize the findings from recent structural studies of the bacteriophages that target Gram positive bacteria for a better understanding of the interactions between host cells and bacteriophages .

@highlight Bacteriophage connectors undergo conformational and positional changes upon sensing of head full signals to terminate genome packaging.
@highlight The tail tubes of bacteriophages phi29 and P68 are composed of a 24 stranded barrel attached to a pseudo hexametric tail knob.
@highlight The distal tail protein Dit provides a platform for loading of various receptor binding proteins onto the long noncontractile phage tails.
@highlight The Gram positive bacterial cell wall triggers conformational changes in the baseplate and sheath contraction of the long contractile tails of bacteriophages.
