 Bacteriophages viruses that infect bacteria are the most abundant biological entities on Earth . Siphophages accounting for 60 of known phages bear a long flexible tail that allows host recognition and safe delivery of the DNA from the capsid to the cytoplasm of the infected cell . Independently from their host and the nature of their receptor at its surface the core tail architecture of all caudophages and of bacterial phage derived contractile injection systems share the same structural organisation and are thought to be homologous . Here we review the recent advances in the structure function and assembly of the core tail architecture of siphophages .

@highlight Siphophage tails share a common core architecture despite great sequence diversity.
@highlight Myophage tails and phage related injection systems also share the same architecture.
@highlight The tail tube domain is the main building block of the core tail proteins.
@highlight Variable decoration domains are often grafted to the tail tube domain.
@highlight Decoration domains allow modulation adaptation and are often involved in host recognition.
