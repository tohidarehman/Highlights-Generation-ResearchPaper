 Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that usurp cellular signaling networks to promote pathogen spread and disease progression . Signaling through extracellular vesicles is an emerging field of study in the virus host interaction network . EVs relay information both locally and distally through incorporated contents typically without tripping innate immune sensors . Therefore this extracellular signaling axis presents itself as a tantalizing target for promoting a favorable niche for the pathogen takeover of the host particularly for chronic infections . From the incorporation of virus encoded molecules such as micro RNAs and proteins enzymes to the envelopment of entire infectious particles evolutionary distinct viruses have shown a remarkable ability to converge on this means of communication . In this review we will cover the recent advances in this field and explore how EV can be used as potential biomarkers for chronic persistent or latent virus infections .
