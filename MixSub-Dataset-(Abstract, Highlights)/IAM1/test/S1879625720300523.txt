 Despite the high disease burden of dengue virus there is no approved antiviral treatment or broadly applicable vaccine to treat or prevent dengue virus infection . In the last decade many antiviral compounds have been identified but only few have been further evaluated in pre clinical or clinical trials . This review will give an overview of the direct acting and host directed antivirals identified to date . Furthermore important parameters for further development that is drug properties including efficacy specificity and stability pre clinical animal testing and combinational drug therapy will be discussed .

@highlight Evaluating drug efficacy specificity and toxicity may help to develop an optimal treatment regime for
@highlight studies.
@highlight Measuring time to resolve viremia
@highlight may help to assess drug efficacy in a more relevant setting for clinical trials.
@highlight Combinational therapy may overcome the main challenges of developing an effective antiviral treatment towards DENV.
