 Alphaviruses are transmitted by an arthropod vector to a vertebrate host . The disease pathologies cellular environments immune responses and host factors are very different in these organisms . Yet the virus is able to infect replicate and assemble into new particles in these two animals using one set of genetic instructions . The balance between conserved mechanisms and unique strategies during virus assembly is critical for fitness of the virus . In this review we discuss new findings in receptor binding polyprotein topology nucleocapsid core formation and particle budding that have emerged in the last five years and share opinions on how these new findings might answer some questions regarding alphavirus structure and assembly .

@highlight Both the E2 and E1 glycoproteins interact with the cellular Mxr8 receptor.
@highlight TF virulence factor production correlates with structural polyprotein topology.
@highlight Some nucleocapsid cores are incomplete shells that can be packaged into particles.
@highlight Particle budding occurs via different mechanisms using different viral components.
