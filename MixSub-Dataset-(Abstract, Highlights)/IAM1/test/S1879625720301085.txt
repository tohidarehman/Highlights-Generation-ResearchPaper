 Influenza B virus is a respiratory pathogen that affects more severely the pediatric and elderly populations . There are two lineages of influenza B virus that seem to have differential predilection for age groups . Both lineages can co circulate during the influenza season however one is usually more prominent than the other depending on the season . There are no defined indicators to predict which lineage will dominate in any given season . In recent years the addition of viruses from both lineages to the seasonal influenza vaccine formulation has improved vaccine protection although quadrivalent vaccines are not available worldwide . Reverse genetics has facilitated advancements in the field of vaccine development against influenza B virus . Different strategies have been explored showing promising results that could potentially lead to the development broadly protective influenza B virus vaccines .

@highlight Influenza season 20192020 showed an earlier onset of influenza B infections and a higher incidence compared to previous seasons.
@highlight Two different reverse genetic systems for IBV were simultaneously published in 2002 using 8 and 12 plasmids respectively.
@highlight Reverse genetics has been crucial for the development of potential alternative vaccine candidates.
@highlight Different live attenuated vaccine platforms have been assessed over the years showing proissing results in terms of protection in animal models.
