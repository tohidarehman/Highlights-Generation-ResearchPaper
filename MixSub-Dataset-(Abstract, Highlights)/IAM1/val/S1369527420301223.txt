 The innate immune system is critical to proper host defense against fungal pathogens which is highlighted by increased susceptibility to invasive disease in immunocompromised patients . Innate cells are equipped with intricate cell machinery to detect invading fungi and facilitate fungal killing recruit additional immune cells and direct the adaptive immune system responses . Understanding the mechanisms that govern a protective response will enable the development of novel treatment strategies . This review focuses on recent insights of signaling and regulation of C type lectin receptors and their effector mechanisms enabling an effective host antifungal immunity .

@highlight Fungal recognition by C type lectin receptors are critical for proper immune response.
@highlight Innate effector pathways contribute to fungal killing and recruit immune cells.
@highlight CLR regulation and signaling can be leveraged for novel treatment strategies.
