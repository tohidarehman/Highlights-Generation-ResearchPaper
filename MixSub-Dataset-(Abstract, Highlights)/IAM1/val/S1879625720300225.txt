 Climate change is leading to increases in global temperatures and erratic precipitation patterns both of which are contributing to the expansion of mosquito borne arboviruses and the populations of the mosquitos that vector them . Herein we review recent evidence of emergence and expansion of arboviruses transmitted by

@highlight Climate change is likely to increase global incidence of mosquito borne viruses.
@highlight Outbreaks of disease caused by
@highlight  borne arboviruses have been more frequent and more intense in recent years.
@highlight Current evidence suggests that climate could be partially driving recent outbreaks across the world.
@highlight More longitudinal analyses are needed at the local level to better understand climate s impact on arbovirus transmission.
@highlight Recent studies in Cordoba Argentina could be useful for understanding arbovirus emergence globally.
