 For malaria parasites regulating sexual commitment the frequency with which asexual bloodstream forms differentiate into non replicative male and female gametocytes is critical because asexual replication is required to maintain a persistent infection of the human host while gametocytes are essential for infection of the mosquito vector and transmission . Here we describe recent advances in understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling this key developmental decision . These include new insights into the mechanistic roles of the transcriptional master switch AP2 G and the epigenetic modulator GDV1 as well as the identification of defined metabolic signals that modulate their activity . Many of these metabolites are linked to parasite phospholipid biogenesis and we propose a model linking this pathway to the epigenetic regulation underlying sexual commitment in

@highlight Sexual commitment requires expression of the silenced transcriptional master switch AP2 G.
@highlight Factors promoting HP1 Hda2 and reducing heterochromatin GDV1 control the activation frequency.
@highlight Metabolites linked to phosphatidylcholine synthesis regulate the frequency of commitment.
@highlight Heterochromatin maintenance and phosphatidylcholine synthesis are linked by methylation metabolites.
