 The innate immune system is the first line of defense against infections with pathogens . It provides direct antiviral mechanisms to suppress the viral life cycle at multiple steps . Innate immune cells are specialized to recognize pathogen infections and activate and modulate adaptive immune responses through antigen presentation co stimulation and release of cytokines and chemokines . Measles virus which causes long lasting immunosuppression and immune amnesia primarily infects and replicates in innate and adaptive immune cells such as dendritic cells macrophages T cells and B cells . To achieve efficient replication measles virus has evolved multiple mechanisms to manipulate innate immune responses by both stimulation and blocking of specific signals necessary for antiviral immunity . This review will highlight our current knowledge in this and address open questions .
