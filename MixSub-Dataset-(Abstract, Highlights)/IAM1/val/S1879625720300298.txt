 The small phenolic compound salicylic acid is a phytohormone that regulates many biological processes although it is most well known for its role in plant defense . SA is an important regulator of systemic acquired resistance a type of systemic immunity that protects uninfected parts of the plant against secondary infections by a broad spectrum of pathogens . SAR involves the generation of mobile signal at the primary infection site which translocate to distal uninfected portions and activate systemic disease resistance . Although SA was considered to not constitute the mobile SAR signal it is preferentially transported from pathogen infected to uninfected parts via the apoplast . Further investigations have revealed that distal transport of SA is indeed essential for SAR . The apoplastic SA transport is regulated by the transpirational pull and partitioning of SA between the symplast and cuticle .

@highlight SA is preferentially transported from pathogen infected to uninfected parts via the apoplast.
@highlight The transport of SA into apoplastic space is likely facilitated by the proton gradient generated upon deprotonation of SA.
@highlight The apoplastic SA transport is regulated by the transpirational pull and partitioning of SA between the symplast and cuticle.
@highlight Distal transport of SA is essential for systemic acquired resistance.
