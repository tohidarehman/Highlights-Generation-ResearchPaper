 Salicylic acid is a plant hormone essential for effective resistance to viral and non viral pathogens . SA biosynthesis increases rapidly in resistant hosts when a dominant host resistance gene product recognizes a pathogen . SA stimulates resistance to viral replication intercellular spread and systemic movement . However certain viruses stimulate SA biosynthesis in susceptible hosts . This paradoxical effect limits virus titer and prevents excessive host damage suggesting that these viruses exploit SA induced resistance to optimize their accumulation . Recent work showed that SA production in plants does not simply recapitulate bacterial SA biosynthetic mechanisms and that the relative contributions of the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways to the SA pool differ markedly between plant species .

@highlight Salicylic acid SA stimulates plants to resist viral replication cell to cell movement and systemic movement
@highlight Recent work indicates that SA also contributes to meristem exclusion of viruses and symptom amelioration
@highlight Certain viruses induce SA biosynthesis as they spread through susceptible hosts suggesting they exploit SA induced resistance to prevent over accumulation and to moderate host damage
@highlight Plant SA biosynthesis from isochorismate is completed in the cytosol not in the plastid and the relative importance of the shikimate versus phenylpropanoid pathways in SA biosynthesis varies between plants
