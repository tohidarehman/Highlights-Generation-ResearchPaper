 The discovery of CRISPR Cas systems and their subsequent application in genome modifications and in gene expression control have fundamentally changed both basic and applied research . They have already been employed to generate novel virus resistance traits either by modifying host factors in the plant genome or by directly inducing targeted virus degradation . Here we summarise the latest developments in this field and discuss the potential applications and concerns around this technology .

@highlight Virus diseases significantly threaten agriculture.
@highlight Genetic resistance is the most effective strategy to combat virus diseases in crops.
@highlight CRISPR Cas technology has already been used to create a first generation of genome edited virus resistant plants.
@highlight Basic research and technological advancements are needed to expedite the next generation of resistance genotypes.
@highlight Engagement between scientists and the public governing bodies will determine the role of genome editing in agriculture
