 Fungi are an important part of the microbiota in healthy barrier tissues . Fungal dysbiosis in turn is associated with local and distal inflammatory diseases . Recent advances have shed light on the antigen specific IL 17 dependent mechanisms that regulate fungal commensalism and prevent fungal overgrowth during homeostasis . Progress in our understanding of species specific differences in fungus host interactions provides new hypotheses of why

@highlight Mycobiota has diverse including pathological effects via often unknown mechanisms.
@highlight Th17 cells directed against mycobiota act in an antigen specific manner.
@highlight Numbers of
@highlight  specific Th17 cells in humans exceed other antigen specificities.
@highlight Th17 cells prevent fungal commensal overgrowth and fungal invasion at epithelia.
@highlight  specific Th17 cells can respond against heterologous antigens.
