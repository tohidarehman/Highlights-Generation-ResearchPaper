 Estimating the contribution of antimicrobial resistance to global mortality and healthcare costs enables evaluation of interventions informs policy decisions on resource allocation and drives research priorities . However assembling the high quality patient level data required for global estimates is challenging . Capacity for accurate microbiology culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is woefully neglected in low and middle income countries and further surveillance and research on community antimicrobial usage bias in blood culture sampling and the contribution of co morbidities such as diabetes is essential . International collaboration between governments policy makers academics microbiologists front line clinicians veterinarians the food and agriculture industry and the public is critical to understand and tackle AMR .

@highlight Current estimates of the global burden of AMR are limited by lack of data.
@highlight Choice of methodological approach for calculating AMR burden impacts on estimates.
@highlight Patient focussed surveillance of drug resistant infection is a priority.
@highlight International collaboration to build sustainable AMR surveillance is essential.
