 Despite the availability of antifungal treatments fungal infections are still causing morbidity all around the globe with unacceptably high mortality rates . A major driver for the rising incidence of serious fungal infections is due to a substantial increase in immunocompromised individuals with autoimmune diseases cancers and transplants . Because of growing resistance in fungus to frontline triazole antifungals and the association of fungal disease with the immunocompromised host adjunctive host directed therapy is seen as a promising choice to improve patient outcomes . Immunotherapeutic treatments being explored as adjunct therapies to existing antifungal treatments include cytokine therapy monoclonal antibodies and cellular immunotherapy . In this review we give a brief overview of potential immunotherapies and recent developments in the field which are needed to tackle the growing problem of fungal diseases .

@highlight Invasive fungal infections have high mortality and are increasingly drug resistant.
@highlight Immunotherapy is a rational approach for fungal disease in immunocompromised.
@highlight Recombinant cytokine therapy is an established approach with broad applicability.
@highlight Cellular therapy with neutrophils T cells and T cell CAR all have clinical potential.
@highlight Vaccines and monoclonal therapies host or fungal directed are emerging options.
