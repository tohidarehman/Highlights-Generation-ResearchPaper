 Recently a lateral flow rapid diagnostic test with good accuracy has been described . This test enables measles specific IgM antibody detection in serum capillary blood and oral fluid . RDTs have the potential to transform measles surveillance by allowing real time case confirmation outside of central regional laboratories and by facilitating a timely public health response . Measles virus genes can also be amplified and sequenced consistently from dried IgM positive RDTs stored outside of cold chain which will enable more complete virologic surveillance . Critical questions remain regarding operational use of RDTs as part of global measles surveillance . Projects to evaluate RDT use as part of national surveillance programs and to commercialize the RDT are underway .

@highlight Measles IgM rapid diagnostic tests RDT have good performance.
@highlight RDTs could expand measles testing beyond central labs in resource limited settings.
@highlight Evaluations of RDT use as part of national measles surveillance are ongoing.
@highlight RDTs have potential to enhance global surveillance and tracking of measles strains.
@highlight Rapid availability of RDT results could decrease measles public health response time.
