 Invasive fungal infections mainly occur in patients suffering from impaired immunity . Their associated mortality is high despite antifungal treatment . Thus several efforts have been made to translate our knowledge on protective antifungal immunity into clinical application . Since the first attempts with transfusion of neutrophilic granulocytes these approaches have become more refined and include administration of cytokines to booster antifungal immune responses or selective stimulation of pattern recognition receptors . Recently novel tools that have proven effective in the treatment of cancer have offered new options for enhancing antifungal immunity . These approaches include checkpoint inhibitors as well as T cell based therapies including chimeric antigen receptor T cells .

@highlight Understanding antifungal immunity can be translated into clinical practice.
@highlight Promising approaches include adjunctive cytokine therapy.
@highlight Development of clinical scale fungus specific T cells is in progress.
@highlight We lack randomized controlled trials for host directed therapy of fungal infections.
