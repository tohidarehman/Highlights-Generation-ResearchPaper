 Vaccine preventable diseases including measles and mumps have been re emerging in countries with sustained high vaccine coverage . For mumps waning immunity has been recognized as a major contributor to recent outbreaks . Although unvaccinated individuals account for most cases in recent measles outbreaks the role of immune waning remains unclear . Accumulating serological and epidemiological evidence suggests that natural immunity induced by infection may be more durable compared to vaccine induced immunity . As the proportion of population immunity via vaccination gradually increases and boosting through natural exposures becomes rare risk of outbreaks may increase . Mechanistic insights into the coupled immuno epidemiological dynamics of waning and boosting will be important to understand optimal vaccination strategies to combat VPD re emergence and achieve eradication .

@highlight Vaccine preventable diseases VPDs have been re emerging despite sustained high vaccine coverage.
@highlight Vaccine induced immunity may wane more rapidly compared to immunity induced by natural infection but this may differ depending on the target.
@highlight Mumps re emergence appears linked to waning vaccine immunity known as secondary vaccine failures.
@highlight Although outbreaks remain concentrated among unvaccinated clusters measles re emergence may also be associated with waning immunity.
@highlight Further research incorporating immunological and epidemiological data are critical to determine best means for preventing VPD re emergence.
