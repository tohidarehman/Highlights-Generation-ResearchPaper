 In the last five years several novel segmented RNA viruses have been discovered in ticks mosquitoes or other arthropods and two viruses including Jingmen tick virus and Alongshan virus are associated with human febrile illness in northeastern China . The viral genome includes four or five segments two of which are genetically derived from unsegmented flaviviruses . Phylogenetic analysis reveals that segmented flaviviruses belong to a separate Jingmenvirus group distinctive from the genera of

@highlight Several novel segmented flaviviruses have been discovered in various arthropods.
@highlight Jingmen tick virus and Alongshan virus are associated with human febrile illness.
@highlight Tick borne segmented flaviviruses are closely related to mammalian isolates.
@highlight Future studies should include epidemiology animal infection model and reverse genetics.
