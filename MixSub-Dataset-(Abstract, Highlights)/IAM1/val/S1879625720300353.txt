 African horse sickness is a devastating disease caused by African horse sickness virus and transmitted by arthropods between its equine hosts . AHSV is endemic in sub Saharan Africa where polyvalent live attenuated vaccine is in use even though it is associated with safety risks . This review article summarizes and compares new strategies to generate safe and effective AHSV vaccines based on protein virus like particles viral vectors and reverse genetics technology . Manipulating the AHSV genome to generate synthetic viruses by means of reverse genetic systems has led to the generation of potential safe vaccine candidates that are under investigation .

@highlight New AHSV vaccines are being developed to improve efficacy and safety.
@highlight Plasmid based or RNA transcript based RG systems have been developed for AHSV.
@highlight RG is applied to design promising strategies for AHSV immunization.
@highlight ECRA and DISC are the main vaccine platforms to produce vaccines based on defective AHSV.
