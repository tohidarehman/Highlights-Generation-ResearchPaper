 Cyclic adenosine monophosphate is an important signalling molecule across evolution but until recently there was little information on its role in malaria parasites . Advances in gene editing in particular conditional genetic approaches and mass spectrometry have paved the way for characterisation of the key components of the cAMP signalling pathway in malaria parasites . This has revealed that cAMP signalling plays a critical role in invasion of host red blood cells by

@highlight cAMP signalling is essential for invasion of red blood cells by malaria parasites.
@highlight cAMP regulates phosphorylation of many essential merozoite proteins including AMA1.
@highlight cGMP and cAMP signalling interact to co ordinate egress then invasion respectively.
@highlight Recent work has advanced understanding of the enzymes involved in both pathways.
