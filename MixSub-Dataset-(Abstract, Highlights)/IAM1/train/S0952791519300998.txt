 The germline encoded innate immunity governs eukaryotic host defense through both hematopoietic and non hematopoietic cells whereas adaptive immunity actions mainly via T cells and B cells characterized by their somatic genetic diversification of antigen specific responses . Human inborn errors of innate immunity typically underlie infectious diseases . Disturbed innate immunity can additionally result in auto inflammation . Here we review inborn errors of innate immunity that have been recently discovered as well as new insights into previously described inborn errors of innate immunity .

@highlight Human inborn errors of innate immunity can present as increased susceptibility to infection with a narrow range of pathogens.
@highlight Non hematopoietic tissue resident cells play a crucial role in human immune defense.
@highlight Both innate as well as adaptive immune responses require tight regulation.
