 The discovery and supply of plant derived anti cancer compounds remain challenging given their low bioavailability and structural complexity . Reconstituting the pathways of these compounds in heterologous hosts is a promising solution however requires the complete elucidation of the biosynthetic genes involved and extensive metabolic engineering to optimise enzyme activity and metabolic flux . This review describes the current strategies and recent advancements in the production of these valuable therapeutic compounds and highlights plant derived immunomodulators as an emerging class of anti cancer agents .

@highlight Plant specialised metabolites constitute an enormous reservoir of anticancer compounds.
@highlight Their low bioavailability
@highlight fails to reach the demand.
@highlight Heterologous pathway reconstitution is a promising alternative to massively producing these compounds.
