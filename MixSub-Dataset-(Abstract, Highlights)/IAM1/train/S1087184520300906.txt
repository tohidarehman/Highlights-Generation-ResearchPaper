 Subtilases are a large family of serine proteases that occur throughout biology . A small subset contain protease associated domains that are structurally separate from but encoded within the active site . In bacteria subtilase PA domains function to recruit specific protein substrates . Here we demonstrate that a protease secreted by the fungal corn pathogen

@highlight We identified a protease secreted by
@highlight  a fungal corn pathogen.
@highlight Kilbournase truncates corn ChitA chitinase cleaving the N terminus multiple times.
@highlight Kilbournase resembles
@highlight ScpA which targets human C5a.
@highlight Kilbournase and ScpA are PA domain subtilases that target specific host proteins.
@highlight Kilbournase is the first protein implicated in Stenocarpella ear rot of corn.
