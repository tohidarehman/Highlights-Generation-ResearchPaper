 Once overlooked as passive bystanders of the human intestinal microbiota new evidence is shedding light on the importance of enterococci and their bacteriophages in shaping human health . Natural predators of enterococci phages represent a narrow spectrum precision targeting modality for the eradication of problematic enterococci within the microbiota or infected tissue . The identification of enterococcal phage receptors absorption factors and transcriptional responses following phage infection reveals a complex predator prey relationship that modulates enterococcal cell surface architecture susceptibility to antibiotics and adaptation to host associated environments . Considering the dry up of contemporary antibiotic discovery pipelines in the pharmaceutical industry and a continued emergence of multidrug resistant enterococci enterococcal phages may serve as bonafide therapeutics . We highlight current advances in enterococcal phage biology with emphasis on recent breakthroughs in potential therapeutic applications that place enterococcal phages at the forefront of next generation biologics .

@highlight Phage bacteria interactions drive key fitness tradeoffs in enterococci.
@highlight Discovery of novel phage receptors will aid in the future therapeutic development of enterococcal phages.
@highlight Enterococcal phage therapy demonstrates efficacy in animal models yet studies in humans are currently lacking.
@highlight Enterococcal gut dysbiosis exacerbates several human diseases that may be mitigated by phage therapy.
