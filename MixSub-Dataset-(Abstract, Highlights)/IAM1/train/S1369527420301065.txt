 Human fungal diseases are a significant global health problem affecting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients . Although patients with single gene inborn errors account for only a small part of patients developing fungal infections studies of these diseases significantly promoted our understanding of the general mechanisms involved in human antifungal immunity . Recently substantial breakthroughs in monogenetic causes of fungal infections have been made which have furthered our knowledge of both new genes of known infections and new phenotypes of reported genes . This review describes recent insights into the human monogenetic errors that cause fungal susceptibility alongside novel genes phenotypes and mechanisms of both innate and adaptive immunity . We hope that this review raises awareness of the recently identified monogenetic causes of fungal diseases to facilitate the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches .

@highlight Monogenetic causes of fungal disease promoted studies of antifungal immunity.
@highlight Advances have been achieved in both novel genes and novel phenotypes.
@highlight Defects in either innate or adaptive immune response underlie fungal susceptibility.
@highlight Genetic causes should be considered in immunocompetent patients of unusual mycosis.
