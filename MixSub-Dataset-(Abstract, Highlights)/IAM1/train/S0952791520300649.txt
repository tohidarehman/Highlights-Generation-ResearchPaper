 Central and peripheral tolerance both contribute to protection against autoimmunity . The pathogenesis of autoimmunity however can result from critical deficits or limitations in peripheral and or central tolerance mechanisms presenting an opportunity for therapeutic intervention . Recent advances highlight the substantial impact of inhibitory receptors which mediate peripheral tolerance in autoimmunity . Deletion and blockade studies in mice IR disruption in humans and correlation with positive disease outcomes all highlight potential clinical benefits of enhancing IR signaling

@highlight Inhibitory receptors IRs play an important role in limiting autoimmunity.
@highlight IR genetic deletion or antibody blockade exacerbates autoimmunity in mouse models.
@highlight SNPs and IR blockade are linked to increases autoimmunity in humans.
@highlight IR expression and signature positively correlate with autoimmune disease outcome.
@highlight IR agonists represent a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of autoimmunity.
