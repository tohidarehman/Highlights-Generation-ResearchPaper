 Flavonoids are dietary non nutrient bioactives with antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties . Fruits vegetables nuts legumes and tea are rich in flavonoids . After consumption flavonoids are extensively metabolized by the gut microbiota and host tissues . Flavonoid metabolism exhibits extensive variation between individuals . It is plausible that inter individual differences in flavonoid metabolism impact the immune system . Pre clinical studies have characterized direct and indirect mechanisms by which flavonoids modulate intestinal immune function . This includes modulation of T cell differentiation alteration of gut microbiota and modulation of cytokines . Defining the importance of these mechanisms to human chronic disease will improve dietary recommendations for the anti inflammatory uses of flavonoids .

@highlight Flavonoids from fruits vegetables nuts and legumes inhibit gut inflammation.
@highlight Gut microbiota and host tissue extensively metabolize dietary flavonoids.
@highlight Flavonoids inhibit gastrointestinal inflammation by direct and indirect mechanisms.
@highlight Both unique and non specific flavonoid metabolites modulate gut immune function.
@highlight Inter individual variability in flavonoid metabolism may impact efficacy.
