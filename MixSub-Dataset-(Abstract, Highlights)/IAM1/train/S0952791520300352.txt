 The complexity and the mechanistic role of microbial communities at mucosal surfaces are only now beginning to be understood . Their impact on host metabolism development and immune responses to infectious and inert stimuli may be centrally linked to the metabolic functions of these communities within the established microbiome . The structure and function of microbial communities are influenced both early and throughout life by many environmental factors exposures diet and disease . Understanding how the microbiome influences the host during health is likely just as important as understanding how it influences asthmatic disease predisposition and severity .

@highlight Differences in gut microbiota and metabolites are linked to asthma pathogenesis.
@highlight Differences in the respiratory microbiota are linked to asthmatic phenotypes.
@highlight Respiratory microbes may set lung immune tone and predispose the host to dysregulated responses.
@highlight How microbial products regulate the local immune environment and shape asthma pathophysiology are incompletely understood.
