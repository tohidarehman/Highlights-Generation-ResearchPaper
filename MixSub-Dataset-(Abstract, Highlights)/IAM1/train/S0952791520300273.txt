 Immune targeted approaches are rapidly changing the therapeutic landscape for cancer . In spite of that most patients show resistance or acquire resistance to these therapies . Increasing work describing the tumor microenvironment has highlighted this space as one of the key determinants in tumor immune response and immunotherapeutic success . Frequently overlooked within this space cancer associated fibroblasts within the TME have surfaced as an important dictator of the tumor immune response . Herein we review recent advances in defining the role of CAF immune cell interactions in solid tumors and prospects for targeting stroma to overcome resistance to immunotherapy .

@highlight Tumor cells drive heterogeneous activation of cancer associated fibroblasts within the tumor microenvironment.
@highlight Fibroblast subpopulations within the TME can promote or suppress tumor immune response with major implications for cancer immunotherapy.
@highlight Current efforts target fibroblast specific pathways and individual fibroblast subpopulations to improve cancer immunotherapy response.
