 Many bacterial pathogens rely on dedicated secretion systems to translocate virulence proteins termed effectors into host cells . These effectors engage and manipulate host cellular functions to support bacterial colonization and propagation . The secretion systems are molecular machines that recognize targeting features in these effector proteins

@highlight Effector arsenal expansion may facilitate bacterial infection of a broader range of hosts.
@highlight Computational machine learning has facilitated large scale effector discovery.
@highlight Substantiating the biological significance of
@highlight identified effectors remains challenging.
