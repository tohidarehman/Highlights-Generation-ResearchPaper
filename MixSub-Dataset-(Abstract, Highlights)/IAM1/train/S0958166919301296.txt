 Bacteriophages can be potent biocontrol agents but their potential has not been fully realized due to inherent limitations of natural phages . By leveraging new tools in synthetic biology natural phages can be engineered to overcome these limitations to markedly improve their efficacy and programmability . Engineered phages can be used for targeted detection and removal of pathogens

@highlight Engineered bacteriophages are promising tools for use in food biotechnology.
