 The recent advent of single cell technologies has fast tracked the discovery of multiple fibroblast subsets in tissues affected by autoimmune disease . In recent years interest in lymph node fibroblasts that support and regulate immune cells has also grown leading to an expanding framework of stromal cell subsets with distinct spatial transcriptional and functional characteristics . Inflammation can drive tissue fibroblasts to adopt a lymphoid tissue stromal cell phenotype suggesting that fibroblasts in diseased tissues can have counterparts in lymphoid tissues . Here we examine fibroblast subsets in tissues affected by autoimmunity in the context of knowledge gained from studies on lymph node fibroblasts with the ultimate aim to better understand stromal cell heterogeneity in these immunologically reactive tissues .

@highlight Recently multiple fibroblast subsets within the synovium and other tissues affected by autoimmune diseases have been delineated.
@highlight Interest in lymphoid tissue stromal cells that support and regulate immune cells has also grown.
@highlight This has led to an expanding framework of fibroblastic cell subsets with distinct spatial transcriptional and functional characteristics.
@highlight Inflammation induced phenotypic changes suggest that fibroblasts in diseased tissues can have counterparts in lymphoid tissues.
@highlight Here we discuss fibroblast subsets in tissues affected by autoimmunity in the context of knowledge gained from studies on lymph node fibroblasts.
