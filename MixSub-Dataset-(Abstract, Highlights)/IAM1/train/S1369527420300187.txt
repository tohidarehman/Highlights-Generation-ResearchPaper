 Chronic infections often contain complex polymicrobial communities that are recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment . The pathogens associated with these infectious communities are often studied in pure culture for their ability to cause disease . However recent studies have begun to focus on the role of polymicrobial interactions in disease outcomes .

@highlight Spatial heterogeneity in the lung environment can influence microbial interactions.
@highlight Context dictates shifts between cooperative and competitive microbial interactions.
@highlight interacts with bacteria fungi and viruses in infection.
@highlight The outcome of these interactions can shape disease progression within the host.
