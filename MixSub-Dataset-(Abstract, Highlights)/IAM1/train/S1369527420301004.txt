 The mammalian immune system can tune its inflammatory response to the threat level posed by an invading pathogen . It is well established that the host utilizes numerous patterns of pathogenicity such as microbial growth invasion and viability to achieve this tuning during bacterial infections . This review discusses how this notion fits during fungal infection particularly regarding

@highlight Host fungal interactions tune the innate inflammatory response to maintain host resistance against distinct fungal isolates.
@highlight Growth viability phagosome escape and cell wall changes are critical patterns of pathogenesis during fungal infection.
@highlight Environmental evolution and growth conditions drive isolate specific virulence traits.
