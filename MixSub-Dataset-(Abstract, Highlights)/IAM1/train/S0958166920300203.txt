 Extremolytes are small organic molecules which protect cells under extreme virtually inhabitable conditions . Their exceptional properties can be translated into health promoting and therapeutic activities which open an avenue of opportunities for the cosmetic medical and food industries . Supported by powerful approaches from systems and synthetic biology and systems metabolic engineering the bio industry becomes more and more attracted to exploit this goldmine . In addition to the well established flagship ectoine several novel extremolytes have emerged in the past years and high efficiency cell factories have been created for bio based extremolyte production . Here we review recent prominent examples and success stories in the field .

@highlight Extremolytes protect extremophilic microbes from environmental stress.
@highlight They enable multiple applications in cosmetics food and health industry.
@highlight Ectoine is the industrial flagship among various extremolytes.
@highlight Heterologous workhorses emerge as extremolyte cell factories.
