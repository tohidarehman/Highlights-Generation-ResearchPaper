 Septins are highly conserved GTP binding proteins that function in cell cytokinesis polarity and morphogenesis . To evaluate the roles of these proteins in inoculum health and disease mutants deleted for each of five septin proteins were characterized in the ascomycete

@highlight The first functional study of the four core septin genes in a Dothideomycete plant pathogen Dothideomycetes is the largest group of phytopathogens.
@highlight Development of sexual reproductive propagules was impacted in
@highlight core
@highlight mutants. Wild type asci formed but ascospores appeared to be blocked in the meiotic process and never formed.
@highlight Development of both asexual reproductive propagules was impacted in
@highlight core
@highlight mutants. Conidia had dramatically reduced numbers of septa and rates of germination.
@highlight mutants showed 83 reduced conidial germination compared to wild type and virulence to the host maize was reduced. Virulence could be returned to that of wild type by adjusting amount of inoculum to compensate for low germination rate.
@highlight Since septins are not found in plants this research may be used to develop strategies that target septins for disease control in the field.
