 Type I interferon is a primary pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus . Gain of function genetic variants in the type I IFN pathway have been associated with risk of disease . Common polygenic as well as rare monogenic influences on type I IFN have been demonstrated supporting a complex genetic basis for high IFN in many SLE patients . Both SLE associated autoantibodies and high type I IFN can be observed in the pre disease state . Patients with SLE and evidence of high type I IFN have more active disease and a greater propensity to nephritis and other severe manifestations . Despite the well established association between type I IFN and SLE the specific triggers of type I IFN production the mechanisms by which IFNs help perpetuate the cycle of autoreactive cells and autoantibody production are not completely clear . This review provides an updated overview of type I IFN in SLE pathogenesis clinical manifestations and current therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway .

@highlight Type I IFN is implicated in SLE pathogenesis by multiple lines of evidence including genetics and induction of SLE by IFN treatment.
@highlight Nucleic acid sensing pathways influence the threshold of activation and triggering of type I IFN production.
@highlight Abnormalities in extracellular processing of DNA can enhance type I IFN production.
@highlight High type I IFN levels are associated with nephritis mucocutaneous manifestations and the presence of autoantibodies in SLE.
@highlight Anifrolumab a monoclonal antibody that blocks the type I IFN receptor has shown therapeutic benefit in SLE.
