 The design of controllable artificial microbial consortia has attracted considerable interest in recent years to capitalize on the inherent advantages in comparison to monocultures such as the distribution of the metabolic burden by division of labor the modularity and the ability to convert complex substrates . One promising approach to control the consortia composition function and stability is the provision of defined ecological niches fitted to the specific needs of the consortium members . In this review we discuss recent examples for the creation of metabolic niches by biological engineering of resource partitioning and syntrophic interactions . Moreover we introduce a complementing process engineering approach to provide defined spatial niches with differing abiotic conditions e.g . O
