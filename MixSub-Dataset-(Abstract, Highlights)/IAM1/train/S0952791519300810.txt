 Humoral immunity critically depends on appropriate B cell responses . B cell activation proliferation differentiation and antibody secretion are processes carefully orchestrated by a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways and transcription factors . In order to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands of protein synthesis and cell division signal transduction pathways reshape the metabolic profile of activated B cells . However the relationship between signaling and metabolism is by no means unidirectional . Emerging evidence suggests that shifts in available fuel sources and intracellular metabolite concentrations profoundly impact cell fate decisions . The reciprocal regulation of cell signaling and metabolism could potentially be exploited to curb immune dysfunction in metabolic disorders or to antagonize autoimmunity and B cell malignancies .

@highlight B cell activation is accompanied be metabolic reprogramming.
@highlight The metabolic state dictates cell fate decisions.
@highlight Metabolic processes affect gene expression and protein activity.
