 The balance and interplay between sexual and asexual reproduction is one of the most intriguing mysteries in the study of fungi . The choice of developmental strategy reflects the ability of fungi to adapt to the changing environment . However the evolution of developmental paths and the metabolic regulation during differentiation and morphogenesis are poorly understood . Here an analysis was performed of carbohydrate metabolism and gene expression regulation during the early differentiation process from the vegetative mycelium to the differentiated structures fruiting body oidia and sclerotia of a homokaryotic fruiting

@highlight Clarified the environmental physiological and transcriptional aspects of four developmental paths of
@highlight Correlated carbon metabolic fluxes and transcriptome profiles during early differentiation.
@highlight Transcriptomes of all developmental paths were under purifying selection.
@highlight Transcriptome age and transcriptome divergence correlated to environmental stress.
@highlight Many metabolic genes were up regulated during sclerotia formation.
