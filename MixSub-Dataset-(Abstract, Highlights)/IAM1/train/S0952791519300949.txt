 In various biological processes phosphatidylserine that is normally sequestered to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is exposed to the cell surface . When platelets are activated they expose PtdSer to activate the blood clotting factors . Cells undergoing apoptosis and senescent neutrophils expose PtdSer that is recognized as an eat me signal by phagocytes for clearance . The PtdSer exposure and its internalization are mediated by phospholipid scramblases and flippases respectively . Both have recently been molecularly identified and their functional mechanism and physiological roles are being elucidated .

@highlight Phospholipid scramblases responsible for the PtdSer exposure in activated platelets and apoptotic cells were identified.
@highlight Distinct mechanisms mediate PtdSer exposure in activated platelets and apoptotic cells.
@highlight The phosphorylation mediated regulation of scramblases and flippases for PtdSer exposure was proposed.
