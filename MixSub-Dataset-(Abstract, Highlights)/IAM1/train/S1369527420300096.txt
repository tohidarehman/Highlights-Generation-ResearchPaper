 Pyrin is an inflammasome sensor in phagocytes that is activated in response to bacterial toxins and effectors that modify RhoA . Pathogen effector triggered pyrin activation is analogous to an indirect guard mechanism in plants . Pyrin activation appears to be triggered when RhoA GTPases in a host cell are prevented from binding downstream signaling proteins . RhoA transducers that control this response include PRK kinases which negatively regulate pyrin by phosphorylation and binding of 14 3 3 proteins . Microtubules regulate pyrin at different levels and may serve as a platform for inflammasome nucleation . Pyrin increases inflammation in the lung gut or systemically during infection or intoxication in mouse models and protects against systemic infection by decreasing bacterial loads . Pathogenic
