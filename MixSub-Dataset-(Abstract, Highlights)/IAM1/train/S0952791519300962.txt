 The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors a large reservoir of tissue macrophages which in concert with other immune cells help to maintain a delicate balance between tolerance to commensal microbes and food antigens and resistance to potentially harmful microbes or toxins . Beyond their roles in resistance and tolerance recent studies have uncovered novel roles played by tissue resident including intestinal resident macrophages in organ physiology . Here we will discuss recent advances in the understanding of the origin phenotype and function of macrophages residing in the different layers of the intestine during homeostasis and under pathological conditions .

@highlight Distinct populations of intestinal macrophages segregated both transcriptionally and anatomically exist in the mouse and human.
@highlight The intestine hosts long lived macrophage populations that are not replenished by circulating monocytes in the steady state.
@highlight Macrophages in the intestinal lamina propria are critical mediators of tissue tolerance under steady state and inflammatory conditions.
@highlight Macrophages in the intestinal muscularis are specialized to interact with the enteric associated nervous system.
@highlight Intestinal macrophages have co opted further roles in tissue physiology including vascular integrity and smooth muscle contraction.
