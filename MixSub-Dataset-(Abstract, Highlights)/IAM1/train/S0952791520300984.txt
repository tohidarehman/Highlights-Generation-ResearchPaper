 Overlap of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease in patients with obstructive lung disease is growing in recognition though there is no consistent agreement on the diagnostic criteria for the disease process . Patients with ACO have distinct clinical characteristics and trajectories which are representative of a heterogenous multifactorial and incompletely understood inflammatory pathophysiology . Current treatment strategies are focused on titration of inhaled therapies such as long acting bronchodilators with increasing interest in the use of targeted biologic therapies aimed at the underlying inflammatory mechanisms . Future directions for research will focus on elucidating the varied inflammatory signatures leading to ACO the development of consistent diagnostic criteria and biomarkers of disease and improving the clinical management with an eye toward targeted therapies .

@highlight Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Overlap ACO represents a unique disease entity with patients manifesting characteristics of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
@highlight ACO is the result of the intersection of varying inflammatory processes manifesting in the common outcome of symptomatic obstructive lung disease.
@highlight The mainstays of treatment continue to be inhaled medications with growing interest in but currently limited evidence for the use of targeted biologic therapies.
