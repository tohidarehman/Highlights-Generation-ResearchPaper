 Modern genome analysis and phylogenomic methods have increased the number of fungal species as well as enhanced appreciation of the degree of diversity within the fungal kingdom . In this context we describe a new

@highlight A new Hypocreales fungal species
@highlight is proposed.
@highlight is phylogenetically related the opportunistic fungal pathogen
@highlight The genome of
@highlight was sequenced assembled and annotated.
@highlight Comparative genomic studies of Hypocreales reveals unique metabolic profile.
@highlight Molecular tools complement traditional morphologic fungal species discovery.
