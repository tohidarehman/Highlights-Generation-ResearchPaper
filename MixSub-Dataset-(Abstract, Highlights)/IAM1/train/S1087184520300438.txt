 Small GTPases of the ADP ribosylation factor family and their activating proteins regulate mycelial development and pathogenicity in yeast and filamentous fungi however little is known about their roles in nematode trapping fungi . In this study an ortholog of Arf GAP Glo3 in

@highlight AoGlo3 is the ortholog of yeast Glo3 and a pleiotropic regulator in
@highlight AoGlo3 is indispensable for conidiation trap formation and nematode trapping.
@highlight AoGlo3 contributes to mycelial growth and environmental adaption.
@highlight AoGlo3 is required for endocytosis and autophagy.
