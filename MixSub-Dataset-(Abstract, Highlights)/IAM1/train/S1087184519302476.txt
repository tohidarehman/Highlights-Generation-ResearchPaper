 Regulation of plant cell wall degradation is of utmost importance for understanding the carbon cycle in nature but also to improve industrial processes aimed at enzyme production for next generation biofuels . Thereby the transcription factor networks in different fungi show conservation as well as striking differences particularly between

@highlight Functions of CLR1 and CLR2 in plant cell wall degradation are rewired in
@highlight Deletion of clr1 or clr2 breaks coregulation of xylanase genes on xylan.
@highlight CLR1 and CLR2 form a positive regulatory feedback loop on xylan.
