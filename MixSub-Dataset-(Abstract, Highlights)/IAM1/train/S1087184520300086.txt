 Nitric oxide can be biologically synthesized from nitrite or from arginine . Although NO is involved as a signal in many biological processes in bacteria plants and mammals still little is known about the role of NO in fungi . Here we show that NO levels are regulated by light as an environmental signal in

@highlight NO levels are regulated by light.
@highlight Phytochrome A is required for induction by light of flavohemoglobin B and arginase.
@highlight The blue photoreceptor LreA represses both genes in the presence of arginine.
@highlight Intracellular arginine levels are regulated during development.
@highlight Deletion of
@highlight results in loss of light regulation of conidiation and NO levels.
