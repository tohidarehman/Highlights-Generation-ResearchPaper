 Myxobacteria conduct complex social traits that requires populations to be highly related and devoid of exploiters . To enrich for clonal cells in populations they employ kin discrimination mechanisms . One key system involves a polymorphic cell surface receptor TraA which recognizes self by homotypic interactions with neighboring myxobacterial cells . Recent studies revealed that TraA and its partner TraB are fluid outer membrane proteins that coalesce into foci upon recognition of kin . The formation of foci leads to transient membrane fusion junctions and the bidirectional exchange of outer membrane components that facilitates cooperative behaviors . Additionally expansive suites of polymorphic lipoprotein toxins are exchanged which act as self identity barcodes that exquisitely discriminate against nonself to assemble homogenous populations .
