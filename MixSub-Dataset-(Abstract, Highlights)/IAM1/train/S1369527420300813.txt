 Antimicrobial resistance is an urgent public health threat and continues to be on the rise . Basic microbiological research is the foundation for addressing knowledge gaps both for the development of new antibiotics diagnostics and preventives but also to inform strategies to mitigate the transmission of resistance and drug resistant microorganisms . Translating this research into new products to reinvigorate dwindling pipelines especially for new antibiotics is one of the main challenges faced in addressing AMR . The scientific complexity is compounded by the market uncertainty of any new products leading to a large proportion of pharmaceutical companies exiting the market . Consequently a number of initiatives were developed to reinvigorate the AMR research and development landscape . Despite all these efforts the antibiotic pipeline remains inadequate to keep up with the increasing rates of resistance globally . Given the number of individual and multilateral actions there is an urgent need for a common platform and coordination to ensure that resources are adequately used to address the critical challenges posed by AMR globally hence the founding of the Global AMR R D Hub to take on this role .

@highlight Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise globally.
@highlight The pipeline for new antibiotics is weak due to market failure.
@highlight New initiatives have been put in place to replenish the antibiotic R D pipeline.
@highlight The Global Antimicrobial Research and Development Hub was founded to coordinate the R D space.
