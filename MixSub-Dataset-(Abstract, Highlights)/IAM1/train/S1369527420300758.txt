 To this day malaria remains a global burden affecting millions of people especially those in sub Saharan Africa and Asia . The rise of drug resistance to current antimalarial treatments including artemisinin based combination therapies has made discovering new small molecule compounds with novel modes of action an urgent matter . The concerted effort to construct enormous compound libraries and develop high throughput phenotypic screening assays to find compounds effective at specifically clearing malaria causing
