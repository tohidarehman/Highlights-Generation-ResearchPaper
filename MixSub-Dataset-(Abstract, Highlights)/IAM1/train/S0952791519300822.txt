 Tissue resident lymphocytes that lack expression of rearranged antigen receptors and are lineage negative for classical T and B cell markers are collectively known as innate lymphoid cells . The ILC family is remarkably heterogeneous and exhibits plasticity however mature ILCs can be grouped based on their steady state expression of distinct surface receptors and transcription factors as well as production of signature cytokines following activation . The study of ILC subsets in mouse and human tissues has revealed that the elicitation and magnitude of their effector functions are determined by a combination of extrinsic cues specific to the niches in which they reside . In this short review we will summarize some recent findings related to tissue specific signals that govern ILC responses and localization .

@highlight Signaling circuits between ILC2s and stroma dictates ILC2 activation in different tissue niches.
@highlight ILC3 function in the intestines is determined in part by residence in microanatomical niches.
@highlight Group 1 ILCs are tremendously heterogenous in mice which is a discordant phenotype from what is observed in humans.
@highlight Under certain conditions ILC1s and ILC2s can become migratory and contribute to host defense systemically.
