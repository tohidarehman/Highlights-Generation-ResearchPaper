 Academic medicine serves to advance the scientific field and provide the highest quality of clinical care . This applies to cancer where there is a continuous unmet need for innovation . In the last decade we have observed a significant development of commercial cell and gene therapy products with a rapid growth of the industry . Hospital based Good Manufacturing Practice facilities which support primarily investigator initiated clinical trials are increasingly involved in interactions with industry . Although the missions of academic and commercial GMP facilities are different both are bound by industry standards and often engage in technology transfer with industry partners . The successful set up of an academic GMP facility requires striking a unique balance between commercial and academic priorities . Here we review the role of academic facilities in the development of cellular therapies with a focus on cancer immunotherapy and we highlight some of the most challenging operational aspects and point to potential solutions .

@highlight Academic cellular GMP facilities are crucial for the advancement of immunotherapy.
@highlight Academic cellular immunotherapy Phase I studies have many challenges.
@highlight Personalized immunotherapies require novel manufacturing strategies.
