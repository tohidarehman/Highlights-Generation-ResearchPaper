 Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease classically presents with severe asthma nasal polyposis and respiratory exacerbations in response to cyclooxygenase 1 inhibition . Recent advances in our understanding of AERD have revealed multiple facets of immune dysregulation including diminished prostaglandin E2 PGE

@highlight AERD patients have baseline sinopulmonary disease worsened upon COX 1 inhibition.
@highlight Immune dysregulation in AERD involves a highly Type 2 process impaired PGE
@highlight regulatory processes and elevated CysLTs.
@highlight Eosinophils mast cells ILC2s and platelet adherent leukocytes contribute to AERD pathogenesis.
@highlight Aspirin therapy improves clinical and inflammatory markers through several unique mechanisms.
