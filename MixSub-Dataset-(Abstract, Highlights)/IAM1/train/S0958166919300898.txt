 Some of the oldest and most established industrial biotechnology processes involve the fungal production of organic acids . In these fungi the transport of metabolites between cellular compartments and their secretion is a major factor . In this review we exemplify the importance of both mitochondrial and plasma membrane transporters in the case of itaconic acid production in two very different fungal systems

@highlight and
@highlight produce itaconic acid by very different pathways.
@highlight Transporters play a central role in fungal organic acid production.
@highlight Recent discoveries challenge long standing assumptions in itaconate production.
