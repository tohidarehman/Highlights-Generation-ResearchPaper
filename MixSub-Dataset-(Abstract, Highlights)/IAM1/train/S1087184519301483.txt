 Chitinases the enzymes responsible for the biological degradation of chitin participate in numerous physiological processes such as nutrition parasitism morphogenesis and immunity in various organisms . However the genome wide distribution evolution and biological functions of chitinases are rarely reported in oomycetes . This study systematically investigated the glycoside hydrolase 18 family of chitinases from the mosquito pathogenic oomycete
