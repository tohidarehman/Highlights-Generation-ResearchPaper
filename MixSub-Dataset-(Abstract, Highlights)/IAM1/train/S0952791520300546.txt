 Systems vaccinology leverages high throughput omics technologies such as transcriptomics metabolomics and mass cytometry coupled with computational approaches to construct a global map of the complex processes that occur during an immune response to vaccination . Its goal is to define the mechanisms of protective immunity and to identify cellular and molecular correlates of vaccine efficacy . Emerging technological advances including integration of multi omics datasets and single cell genomic and epigenomic profiling of immune responses have invigorated systems vaccinology and provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the cellular and molecular information underlying immune memory is stored in the innate and adaptive immune systems . Here we will review these emerging directions in systems vaccinology with a particular focus on the epigenome and its impact on modulating vaccination induced memory in the innate and adaptive immune systems .
