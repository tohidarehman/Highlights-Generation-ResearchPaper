 During growth filamentous fungi produce polarized cells called hyphae . It is generally presumed that polarization of hyphae is dependent upon secretion through the Spitzenkrper as well as a mechanism called apical recycling which maintains a balance between the tightly coupled processes of endocytosis and exocytosis . Endocytosis predominates in an annular domain called the sub apical endocytic collar which is located in the region of plasma membrane 15m distal to the Spitzenkrper . It has previously been proposed that one function of the sub apical endocytic collar is to maintain the apical localization of polarization proteins . These proteins mark areas of polarization at the apices of hyphae . However as hyphae grow these proteins are displaced along the membrane and some must then be removed at the sub apical endocytic collar in order to maintain the hyphoid shape . While endocytosis is fairly well characterized in yeast comparatively little is known about the process in filamentous fungi . Here a bioinformatics approach was utilized to identify 39
