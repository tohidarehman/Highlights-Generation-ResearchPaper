 The lung is a central organ for immune environmental interactions ranging from tolerance against harmless substances to protection against pathogens which are particularly sensitive to regulation by the intestinal microbiota . Airborne fungi can cause variety of diseases including allergies and inflammatory disorders as well as life threatening invasive infections . Remarkable differences exist between ubiquitous fungal species with regard to protective immune mechanisms . Recent data have surprisingly identified Aspergillus specific regulatory T cells as an essential tolerance checkpoint and provided mechanistic insight for the loss of tolerance in the course of immune pathologies . Furthermore pathogenic Th17 cells in Aspergillus associated inflammatory disease seem to be induced by cross reactivity to the intestinal commensal
