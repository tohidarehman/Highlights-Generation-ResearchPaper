 Due to the rapid onset and spread of the COVID 19 pandemic the treatment of COVID 19 patients by hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other drugs has captured a great deal of attention and triggered considerable debate . Historically the worldwide use of quinoline based drugs has led to a spectacular reduction in death from malaria . Unfortunately scientists have been forced to seek alternative drugs to treat malaria due to the emergence of chloroquine resistant parasites in the 1960s . The repurposing of hydroxychloroquine against viral infections various types of cancer and autoimmune diseases has been ongoing for more than 70 years with no clear understanding of its mechanism of action . Here we closely examine the MOA of this old but influential drug in and beyond malaria . Better insights into how chloroquine targets the hosts cellular and immune responses may help to develop applications against to new pathogens and diseases and perhaps even restore the clinical utility of chloroquine against malaria .

@highlight Chloroquine hydroxychloroquine is an old anti malarial drug belongs to 4 aminoquinolines.
@highlight Chloroquine has additional anti virus anti bacteria anti protozoan anti autoimmunity and anti cancer effects.
@highlight Mechanism of action of chloroquine in malaria and other diseases is not understood well.
@highlight Chloroquine directly targets
@highlight hemoglobin degradation pathway.
@highlight In addition chloroquine may directly target hosts autophagy innate and adaptive immunity in malaria.
