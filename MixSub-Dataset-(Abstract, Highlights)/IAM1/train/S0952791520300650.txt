 Flaviviruses are a group of important emerging and re emerging human pathogens that cause worldwide epidemics with thousands of deaths annually . Flaviviruses are small enveloped positive sense single stranded RNA viruses that are obligate intracellular pathogens relying heavily on host cell machinery for productive replication . Proteomic approaches have become an increasingly powerful tool to investigate the mechanisms by which viruses interact with host proteins and manipulate cellular processes to promote infection . Here we review recent advances in employing quantitative proteomics techniques to improve our understanding of the complex interplay between flaviviruses and host cells . We describe new findings on our understanding of how flaviviruses impact proteinprotein interactions proteinRNA interactions protein abundance and post translational modifications to modulate viral infection .

@highlight Mass spectrometry MS based proteomics is a powerful tool to investigate flavivirus host interactions.
@highlight MS coupled with genetic screens can identify host proteins that physically interact with flaviviruses and impact viral replication.
@highlight MS can elucidate mechanisms of dysregulation and post translational modifications of host proteins in flavivirus infected cells.
