 An overarching theme of cellular regulation in bacteria arises from the trade off between growth and stress resilience . In addition the formation of biofilms contributes to stress survival since these dense multicellular aggregates in which cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix of self produced polymers represent a self constructed protective and homeostatic niche . As shown here for the model bacterium

@highlight Growth versus maintenance resilience is the overarching theme of cellular regulation.
@highlight Why transition to multicellularity is integrated into the growth versus survival framework.
@highlight The large scale architecture of biofilms reflects growth versus survival transitions in 3D space.
@highlight Sigma factors and transcription factors as the backbone of the regulatory network.
@highlight Small signaling molecules as dynamic network triggers and drivers.
