 Mast cells are long lived immune cells . They are armed with preformed mediators within granules that can be instantaneously released in response to an invading pathogen including certain viruses . At the skin and mucosae they initiate innate immune responses and promote the development of adaptive immune responses through cellular recruitment or antigen presentation . However systemic MC activation may promote immune pathologies through their vasoactive proteases and biogenic amines . Recently MC products were identified to contribute to pathologies associated with viral hemorrhagic fever such vascular leakage and thrombocytopenia . Similar associations of MCs with disease severity have been noted for certain respiratory viral pathogens . Here we discuss the specific MC responses to viruses and their influences on functional immune outcomes during infection .

@highlight At the host environment interfaces such as skin or mucosae mast cells act as immune sentinels for variety of pathogens including viruses.
@highlight Mast cells initiate cellular immune responses at the infection site by recruitment of various subsets of T cells.
@highlight Systemic activation of mast cells is associated with vascular pathologies during viral infections.
@highlight Targeting of mast cell specific products has a promising therapeutic potential in treating virus induced immune pathologies.
