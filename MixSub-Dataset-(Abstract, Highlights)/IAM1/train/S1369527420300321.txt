 With more than one million bacterial genome sequences uploaded to public databases in the last 25 years genomics has become a powerful tool for studying bacterial biology . Here we review recent approaches that leverage large numbers of whole genome sequences to decipher the spread and pathogenesis of bacterial infectious diseases .

@highlight WGS is a new gold standard for detection of clonal outbreaks and transmission events.
@highlight WGS ancestral reconstruction and GWAS allow unbiased functional prediction.
@highlight WGS of longitudinal infection can be used to detect host adaptations.
@highlight The data loss common in WGS methods may be tackled with database driven approaches.
