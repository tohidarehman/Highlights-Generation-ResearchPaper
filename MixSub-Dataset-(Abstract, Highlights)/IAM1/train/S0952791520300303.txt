 The germinal centre is a specialized cellular structure that forms in response to antigenic stimulation . It generates long term humoral immunity through the production of memory B cells and long lived antibody secreting plasma cells . Conventional GCs form within secondary lymphoid organs where networks of specialised stromal cells that form during embryogenesis act as the stage upon which the various GC immune cell players are brought together nurtured and co ordinated to generate a productive response . In non lymphoid organs ectopic GCs can form in response to persistent antigenic and inflammatory stimuli . Unlike secondary lymphoid tissues non lymphoid organs do not have a developmentally programmed stromal cell network capable of supporting the germinal centre reaction therefore the local tissue stroma must be remodelled by inflammatory stimuli in order to host a GC reaction . These ectopic GCs produce memory B cells and plasma cells that form a critical component of the humoral immune response .

@highlight Stromal cells support the initiation maintenance and output of germinal centre responses.
@highlight Fibroblasts are key mediators of tertiary lymphoid structure assembly in non lymphoid tissues.
@highlight Activated lung resident fibroblasts mediate lymphocyte recruitment for ectopic germinal centre formation.
@highlight Follicular like stroma can support cross reactive germinal centres in the lung.
