 Putative methyltranferase LaeA and LaeA like proteins which are conserved in many filamentous fungi regulate the sporogenesis and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites . In this study we reported the biological function of a LaeA like methyltransferase

@highlight LaeA like methyltransferase Mtr23B contributes to spore pigment formation and the expression of secondary metabolic gene cluster and glycoside hydrolase genes in
@highlight Mtr23B has similarities and differences with LaeA in regulating the above biological processes.
@highlight LaeA interacts with VeA while Mtr23B does not interact with VeA directly. Mtr23B may regulate cellulase and amylase gene transcription by interacting with HAP5 and chromatin remodeling complex.
