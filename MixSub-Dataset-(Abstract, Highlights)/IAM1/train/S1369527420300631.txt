 Compared to bacteria fungi often exhibit a lower abundance and a higher temporal volatility in the intestinal microbiota . Analysis of fungi in the microbiota faces technical limitations with tools that were originally developed for analyzing bacteria . Dysbiotic states of the intestinal mycobiota often associated with disruption of the healthy bacterial microbiota are characterized by overgrowth of specific fungal taxa and loss of diversity . Intestinal domination by
