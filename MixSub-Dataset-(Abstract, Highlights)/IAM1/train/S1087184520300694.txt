 This work presents the identification and proposed biosynthetic pathway for a compound of mixed polyketide nonribosomal peptide origin that we named acurin A . The compound was isolated from an extract of the filamentous fungus

@highlight A biosynthetic gene cluster for the hybrid polyketide nonribosomal peptide compound acurin A in
@highlight The PKS and NRPS responsible for acurin A production are two individually transcribed entities.
@highlight Phylogenetics suggest that the separated PKS and NRPS is a result from the fission of an ancestral PKS NRPS hybrid.
@highlight The biosynthetic capacity of
@highlight is facilitated by the use of CRISPR Cas9 gene editing.
