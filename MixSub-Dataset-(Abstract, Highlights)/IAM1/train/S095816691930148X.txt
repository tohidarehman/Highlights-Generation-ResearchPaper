 The global challenges of ensuring sufficient safe and nutritious food for all are enshrined within the Sustainable Development Goals . As our planet s population continues to grow and as the impacts of climate change and environmental pollution become more visible to all new solutions continue to be sought as to how best address these . Transgenic crops specifically focussed on delivering health beneficial compounds will likely play a role in this and this review will consider several areas where good progress has been made . In particular the transition from basic research to commercial product is a journey that more and more projects are embarking on hopefully leading to the fulfilment of earlier promises as to the potential of genetically modified plants to deliver improved human nutrition .

@highlight Transgenic plants as green factories for the production of compounds with human health benefits.
@highlight Reduced environmental footprint and improved sustainability via GM plants.
@highlight Translation of basic research into tangible products.
