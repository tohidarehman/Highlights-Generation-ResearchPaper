 The human body is host to several distinct microbial communities . Disruption of these communities increases susceptibility to a wide range of diseases including respiratory tract infections . While commensal bacteria in the gut contribute to this effect recent studies point to a role for commensals occupying the upper respiratory tract through direct pathogen killing and by modifying nasal and lung immune homeostasis . Clinical trials exploring probiotic respiratory tract commensals are an exciting development in this area . Upper respiratory tract microbiome sequencing has revealed that destabilization of this community precedes infection indicating that microbiome profiling of individuals has predictive value . Further investigation of respiratory tract commensalhost interactions will be critical to translate bacterial mediated protection toward new therapeutic approaches for respiratory tract disease .
