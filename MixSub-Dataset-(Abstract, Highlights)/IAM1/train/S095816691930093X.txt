 Bacteriophages can play a useful role as narrow spectrum antimicrobials in food safety and in food production . Consumer attitudes towards traditional additives have led to a search for natural potentially clean label alternatives . At the same time the rise in antimicrobial resistance has created a need for alternative antimicrobials for disease prevention and treatment in animal husbandry . Phages represent a viable option for both of these applications . We highlight important barriers which should be considered to improve the chance of a positive outcome when using phages in food and food production . These include the feasibility of adding high concentrations of phages the physico chemical properties of the food or target how and when phages are applied and which phages are chosen .

@highlight Phages are now being used as preharvest and post harvest biocontrol agents in food.
@highlight This is timely in light of consumer attitudes to preservatives and restrictions on antibiotics in animal husbandry.
@highlight Multiple barriers must be overcome if phages are to be successfully deployed in food and in animal husbandry.
