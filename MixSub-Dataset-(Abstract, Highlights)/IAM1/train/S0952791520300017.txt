 Advances in the field of T cell memory including the discovery of tissue residency continue to add to the list of defined T cell subsets . Here we briefly review the role of resident memory T cells T

@highlight reside in tissues without recirculating.
@highlight Memory T cells are more heterogenous than implied by a few discrete subset labels.
@highlight Popular subset labels do not perfectly define boundaries of developmental potential.
@highlight are not terminally differentiated and exhibit plasticity.
@highlight A terrace T cell differentiation model based on developmental potential and migration is proposed.
