 The fungal cell wall consists of proteins and polysaccharides formed by the co ordinated activity of enzymes such as chitin or glucan synthases . These enzymes are delivered via secretory vesicles to the hyphal tip . In the ascomycete

@highlight Native chitin Chs5 and glucan synthase Gsc1 visualised in the pathogen
@highlight Chs5 and Gsc1 are transported along microtubules.
@highlight Chs5 and Gsc1 do localise to the apical plasma membrane but not the Spitzenkrper.
