 Research that meaningfully integrates constraint based modeling with machine learning is at its infancy but holds much promise . Here we consider where machine learning has been implemented within the constraint based modeling reconstruction framework and highlight the need to develop approaches that can identify meaningful features from large scale data and connect them to biological mechanisms to establish causality to connect genotype to phenotype . We motivate the construction of iterative integrative schemes where machine learning can fine tune the input constraints in a constraint based model or contrarily constraint based model simulation results are analyzed by machine learning and reconciled with experimental data . This can iteratively refine a constraint based model until there is consistency between experimental data machine learning results and constraint based model simulations .

@highlight Machine learning has already been successfully applied to facets of constraint based modeling.
@highlight Further development of the combined framework has great potential to elucidate both model parameters and masked biological relationships.
@highlight Iterative integrative machine learning schemes can be seamlessly applied to the established constraint based modeling pipeline.
