 While synthetic nitrogen fuels modern agriculture its production is energy intensive and its application leads to aquatic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions . Sustainable intensification of agriculture to provide both food for humans and feedstocks for bio based fuels and materials requires alternative options for nitrogen management . For nearly fifty years nitrogen fixation in cereal crops has been pursued to address this challenge . Efforts to engineer plants for nitrogen fixation have made strides through eukaryotic nitrogenase expression and a deepened understanding of root nodulation pathways but deployment of transgenic nitrogen fixing cereals may be outpaced by population growth . By contrast a root associated bacterium that can fix and supply nitrogen to cereals could offer a sustainable solution for nitrogen management on a shorter timescale .

@highlight Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers hinder sustainable agricultural intensification.
@highlight Nitrogen fixation in cereal crops is a feasible and sustainable alternative.
@highlight Recent advances are creating paths to transgenic nitrogen fixing cereal crops.
@highlight Gene editing of associative nitrogen fixing bacteria may be a near term solution.
