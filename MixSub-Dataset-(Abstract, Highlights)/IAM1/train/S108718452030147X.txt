 Oleaginous yeasts have stood out due to their ability to accumulate oil which can be used for fatty acid derived biofuel production .

@highlight is phylogenetically closer to non oleaginous basidiomycete yeasts.
@highlight Purine degradation might recycle nitrogen during the lipid accumulation phase.
@highlight Leucine degradation contributes for acetyl CoA supply for fatty acid synthesis.
@highlight Malic enzyme seems to play an important role in the supply of NADPH for fatty acid synthesis.
