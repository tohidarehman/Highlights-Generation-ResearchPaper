 Innate immune perception is the first line of inducible defense against invading pathogens . Plants lack specialized circulating immune cells . Therefore diverse cell types are able to recognize and respond to pathogens . Surface localized and intracellular plant innate immune receptors are capable of recognizing diverse pathogen components . Intracellular nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat receptors recognize pathogen effectors delivered inside host cells . Recent advances shed light onto NLR activation phosphorylation of defense signaling nodes and overlap in transcriptional responses between pathogen perception and abiotic stress .

@highlight Plant NLRs recognize intracellular effectors inducing cell death and resistance.
@highlight NLRs exhibit diverse localization and modes of effector recognition.
@highlight The Arabidopsis ZAR1 NLR forms a pentameric resistosome complex upon activation.
@highlight Abiotic stress and innate immunity induce overlapping transcriptional reprogramming.
