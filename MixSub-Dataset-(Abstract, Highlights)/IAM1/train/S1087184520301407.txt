 Subtilases represent the second largest subfamily of serine proteases and are important for various biological processes . However the biological function of subtilases has not been systematically characterized in plant pathogens . In present study 32 subtilases were identified in the genome of wheat scab fungus

@highlight The functions of subtilases were systematically characterizd in
@highlight FgPrb1 is important for virulence in
@highlight FgPrb1 regulates toxin biosynthesis and response to osmotic stress in
@highlight FgPrb1 participates in regulating lipid metabolism and autophagy in
