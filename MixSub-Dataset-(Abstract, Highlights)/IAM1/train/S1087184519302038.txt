 The detrimental effect of fungal pathogens on forest trees is an increasingly important problem that has implications for the health of our planet . Despite this the study of molecular plant microbe interactions in forest trees is in its infancy and very little is known about the roles of effector molecules from forest pathogens .

@highlight  and
@highlight share effector genes.
@highlight In
@highlight  many of these are pseudogenized or are poorly expressed
@highlight All these effectors are polymorphic among global
@highlight isolates.
@highlight DsEcp2 1 triggers cell death in a non host plant and restricts
@highlight growth in pine.
@highlight These results suggest both pathogen and host adaptation at the molecular level.
