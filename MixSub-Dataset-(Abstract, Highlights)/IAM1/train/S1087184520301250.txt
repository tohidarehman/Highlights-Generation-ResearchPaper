 Ustiloxins are ribosomally synthesized and post translationally modified peptides first reported in Ascomycetes . Originally identified as metabolites of the rice pathogenic fungus

@highlight Synthetic genes of ustiloxin core peptides were expressed in
@highlight Ustiloxin B was synthesized from the synthetic gene encoding YAIG.
@highlight Ustiloxin biosynthetic machinery is optimized for native core peptide sequences.
@highlight Hydroxyl group of Tyr in ustiloxin core peptide is indispensable for cyclization.
