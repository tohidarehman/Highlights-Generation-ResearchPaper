 The endoplasmic reticulum is composed of distinct structural domains that perform diverse essential functions including the synthesis of membrane lipids and proteins of the cell endomembrane system . The polarized growth of fungal hyphal cells depends on a polarized secretory system which delivers vesicles to the hyphal apex for localized cell expansion and that involves a polarized distribution of the secretory compartments including the ER . Here we show that additionally the ER of the ascomycete

@highlight An ER domain is associated with the polarized growing apical cells of hyphae.
@highlight The apical ER domain consists of dynamic and pleomorphic ER sub compartments.
@highlight The apical ER sub compartments undergo fusion and division events.
@highlight The apical ER sub compartments display acropetal and basipetal displacements.
