 The cell wall is a distinctive feature of filamentous fungi providing them with structural integrity and protection from both biotic and abiotic factors . Unlike plant cell walls fungi rely on structurally strong hydrophobic chitin core for mechanical strength together with alpha and beta glucans galactomannans and glycoproteins . Cell wall stress conditions are known to alter the cell wall through the signaling cascade of the cell wall integrity pathway and can result in increased cell wall chitin deposition . A previously isolated set of
