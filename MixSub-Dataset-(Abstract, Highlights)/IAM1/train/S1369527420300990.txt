 The trillions of microbes that constitutively colonize the intestine impact diverse aspects of human physiology in health and disease . Immunoglobulin A is the most abundant antibody isotype produced at mucosal surfaces and nearly two grams of IgA is secreted into the intestine every day . Secretory IgA provides critical protection against pathogens and toxins but can also directly bind to and coat commensal bacteria in the gut . Commensal targeting by SIgA shapes gut microbiota composition modulates bacterial behaviors and enforces host microbiota homeostasis in both mice and humans .

@highlight Secretory immunoglobulin A SIgA is the dominant antibody at mucosal surfaces.
@highlight Gut commensals are coated by SIgA at varied levels.
@highlight SIgA targeting regulates bacterial activities and shapes gut microbiota composition.
@highlight SIgA enforces host microbiota homeostasis throughout the lifespan.
