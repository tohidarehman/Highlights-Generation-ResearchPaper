@highlight Evaluation of 35
@highlight strains isolated from Brazil for lovastatin and itaconic acid production.
@highlight Molecular identification enabled to separate the 35 Aspergillus terreus strains in three monophyletic groups.
@highlight Lovastatin production stands out in the monophyletic group
@highlight B.
@highlight There is no specific monophyletic group for itaconic acid producing strains.
@highlight Identification of seven Brazilian strains with different levels of lovastatin and itaconic acid production.
@highlight Lovastatin genomic data was corroborated by metabolite detection using LC MS.
