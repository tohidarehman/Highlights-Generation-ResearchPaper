 The repertoire of microbial cues monitored by animal and plant tissues encompasses not just molecules but also microbial activities . These include typical pathogen strategies of injuring membranes degrading cellular material and scavenging resources . These activities however are not exclusive to pathogens . Instead they characterize the competitive strategies of microbes living in multispecies communities like those typically found colonizing host tissues . Similar activities are also deployed by host tissues to keep microbes in check . We propose that host surveillance and mimicry of Microbial Associated Competitive Activities derived from an evolutionary history of living in mixed microbial communities has shaped contemporary animal and plant tissue programs of defense repair metabolism and development .

@highlight Hosts monitor their resident Microbial Associated Competitive Activities MACAs .
@highlight MACAs target cellular vulnerabilities common to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
@highlight Hosts deploy MACA mimics to control resident microbes and invading pathogens.
@highlight Host sensing of MACAs regulates tissue programs of defense repair and growth.
@highlight Host sensing of MACA mimics refines programs of tissue defense and development.
