 is an etiologic agent of cryptococcosis a potentially fatal disease that affects humans and animals . The successful infection of mammalian hosts by cryptococcal cells relies on their ability to infect and survive in macrophages . Such phagocytic cells present a hostile environment to intracellular pathogens via the production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species as well as low pH and reduced nutrient bioavailability . To overcome the low metal environment found during infection fungal pathogens express high affinity transporters including members of the ZIP family . Previously we determined that functional zinc uptake driven by Zip1 and Zip2 is necessary for full

@highlight Zip3 is ortholog to

@highlight Cryptococcal cells rely on the proper expression of Zip3 to sustain stress conditions.
@highlight Zip3 impacts the secretion of extracellular vesicles and glucuronoxylomannan.
@highlight The absence of Zip3 led to impaired virulence of
