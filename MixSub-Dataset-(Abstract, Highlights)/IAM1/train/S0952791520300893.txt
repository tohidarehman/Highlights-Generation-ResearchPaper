 B cell differentiation driven by microbial antigens leads to production of anti microbial antibodies such as those neutralizing viruses bacteria or bacterial toxin that are class switched and somatically hypermutated as well as secreted in large volume by plasma cells . Similar features characterize pathogenic antibodies to self antigens in autoimmunity reflecting the critical role of class switch DNA recombination somatic hypermutation and plasma cell differentiation in the generation of antibodies to not only foreign antigens but also self antigens . Central to CSR SHM and plasma cell differentiation are AID a potent DNA cytidine deaminase encoded by
