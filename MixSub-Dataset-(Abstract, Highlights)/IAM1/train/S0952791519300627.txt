 Macrophages are found in large numbers in the adipose tissue where they closely associate with the adipocytes and the vasculature . Adipose tissue macrophages are a heterogenous population of cells with hard wired diversity brought upon by distinct developmental lineages . The purpose of this review is to provide a brief history of macrophages in control of adipose tissue metabolism with the emphasis on the importance of macrophage ontogeny .

@highlight Adipose tissue is populated with developmentally distinct populations of macrophages.
@highlight Yolk sac derived adipose tissue macrophages control adipocyte hypertrophy.
@highlight Bone marrow derived macrophages contribute to systematic inflammation.
