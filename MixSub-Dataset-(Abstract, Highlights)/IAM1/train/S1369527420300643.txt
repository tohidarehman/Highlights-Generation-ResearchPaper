 is a major cause of fungal nosocomial infections . Host defense against disseminated infections caused by this yeast strongly relies on myeloid cells of the innate immune system . Recently several breakthroughs have been made that significantly improved our understanding of the role of macrophages during candidiasis and how

@highlight Tissue resident macrophages are central to counteract systemic candidiasis.
@highlight Macrophages engulf yeast but struggle with hypha forming frustrated phagosomes.
@highlight evolved strategies to counteract the microbicidal phagosomal environment.
@highlight can employ four distinct mechanisms to escape from macrophages.
@highlight Modulation of macrophage activity may improve the outcome of systemic candidiasis.
