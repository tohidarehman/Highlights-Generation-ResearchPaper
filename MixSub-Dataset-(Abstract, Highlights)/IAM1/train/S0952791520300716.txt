 Over the last few years immune cell metabolism has become one of the most stimulating areas of investigation in the field of immunology . Compelling evidence has revealed that metabolic pathways are closely associated to cell functions and immune cells adopt defined metabolic programs to sustain their activity and respond to micro environmental demands . It is now clear that alterations in cell metabolism can favour dysregulation typical of autoreactive immune cells thus sustaining loss of immunological self tolerance .

@highlight Metabolic programs play a key role in immune response.
@highlight Defects in metabolic pathways associated with loss of immunological tolerance.
@highlight Systemic metabolic status promotes immune cell dysregulation and accelerate autoimmune processes.
@highlight Targeting metabolic abnormalities in immune cells may help to ameliorate autoimmunity.
