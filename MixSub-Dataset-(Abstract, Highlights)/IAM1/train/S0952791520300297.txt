 The skin is inhabited by several immune cell populations that serve as a first line of defence against pathogen invasion . Amongst these populations are dendritic cells which play an essential sentinel function by taking up antigen or infectious agents and transporting them to the lymph node for T cell recognition and the priming of immune responses .

@highlight Skin epithelia and stromal cells provide dendritic cells with positioning cues and access to antigen.
@highlight IRF4 dependent dendritic cells have a prominent role in antigen uptake and surveillance.
@highlight Immunological niches establish cytokine microenvironments in skin.
@highlight The study of dendritic cells in skin is revealing new functions for these cells.
