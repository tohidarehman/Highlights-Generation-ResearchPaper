 Microorganisms produce extracellular compounds that affect the final product quality in fermentation processes . Selection of overproducing mutants requires coupling of the extracellular product to the producer genotype which can be achieved by single cell compartmentalization . Emulsions contain up to billions of microdroplets mL which significantly increases the screening throughput compared to microtiter plate based selections . Factors affecting the success of screening in microdroplets include the nature of the producing organism the product and the product assay . Together these factors determine the required microdroplet production technique and sorting set up . Because microdroplets allow relatively inexpensive ultrahigh throughput screening they are likely to become a standard tool in the strain selection toolbox of the fermentation industry .
