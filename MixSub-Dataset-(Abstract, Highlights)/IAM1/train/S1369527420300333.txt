 is known for its intrinsic resistance to conventional antibiotic treatment and hypervirulence during infection . This coupled with its extraordinary capacity to survive in myriad harsh environments has led to increasing rates of infection in clinical settings . Numerous studies have characterized the virulence factors and resistance genes in

@highlight encodes a variety of transcription factors two component systems and small RNAs that influence survival during infection.
@highlight ABUW 1645 is a novel regulator that serves as a switch between avirulent and virulent phenotypes during infection within the host.
@highlight The two component system BfmRS regulates pathways involved in cell division and wall synthesis and consequently has a profound influence on pathogenic potential.
@highlight The global regulator Zur is essential for
@highlight pathogenicity as it helps circumvent host nutritional immunity during
@highlight infection.
@highlight The TF AceR regulates the AceI efflux pump which is responsible for resistance to the commonly used antiseptic chlorohexidine.
