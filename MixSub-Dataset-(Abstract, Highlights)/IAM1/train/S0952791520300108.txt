 Messenger RNA vaccines represent a relatively new vaccine class showing great promise for the future . This optimism is built on recently published studies demonstrating the efficacy of mRNA vaccines in combatting several types of cancer and infectious pathogens where conventional vaccine platforms may fail to induce protective immune responses . These results would not have been possible without critical recent innovations in the field such as the development of safe and efficient materials for

@highlight mRNA vaccines address many of the weaknesses of conventional vaccine types.
