 Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized producers of Type I interferon that promote anti viral and anti tumor immunity . However chronic infections and cancer inhibit pDC derived IFN I . While the mechanisms of this inhibition are multifarious they can be classified broadly into two categories i reduction or ablation of pDC IFN I production capacity and or ii decrease in pDC numbers . Recent work has identified many processes that contribute to suppression of pDC derived IFN I during chronic infections and cancer including sustained stimulation through Toll Like Receptors inhibitory microenvironments inhibitory receptor ligation and reduced development from bone marrow progenitors and apoptosis . Emerging success leveraging pDCs in treatment of disease through TLR activation illustrates the therapeutic potential of targeting pDCs . Deeper understanding of the systems that limit pDC derived IFN I has the potential to improve these emerging therapies as well as help devising new approaches that harness the outstanding IFN I production capacity of pDCs .

@highlight Chronic infections and cancer cause long term pDC functional exhaustion and alterations in pDC population dynamics.
@highlight Sustained TLR stimulation suppressive milieus and inhibitory receptors may contribute to pDC functional exhaustion.
@highlight Reduced pDC development peripheral self renewal apoptosis and conversion into cDC like cells may alter pDC population dynamics.
