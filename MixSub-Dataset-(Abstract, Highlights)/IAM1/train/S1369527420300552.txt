 Anti fungal immunity is characterized by the continuous interplay between immune activation and immune regulation processes . These processes have now been clearly shown not only in animal pre clinical models but also in humans . To create and maintain this immune homeostasis reciprocal interactions among the host immune system fungal pathogens and the microbiome are crucial . Notably the microbiome exerts multiple direct and indirect antifungal effects that are particularly aimed at minimizing host tissue damage . Thus in this microbiome era the architecture of 3D culture system or tissue organoids might finally represent a simple but effective

@highlight The increased incidence of human fungal infections is related to immune disorders.
@highlight Humans are holobionts maintaining balanced interactions with pathobionts and the microbiome.
@highlight The host microbiome contributes to both antifungal resistance and tolerogenic strategies.
@highlight Organoids may be used as mini holobionts systems to model the host fungus microbiome disease triangle.
