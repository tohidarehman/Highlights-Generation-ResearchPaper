 Ubiquitination an important process in post translational modification regulates various mechanisms in eukaryotes including protein degradation and interaction cell cycle stress response and pathogenicity . The Skp1 Cullin F box and the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation complexes RING E3 ligase complexes are involved in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and protein quality control . The F box protein has FBXO FBXW and FBXL classes depending on which interaction domain is present on the C terminus . The ubiquitin system component cue protein is a key factor of ERAD . However the biological roles of FBXO and CUE proteins are largely unknown in plant pathogenic fungi including
