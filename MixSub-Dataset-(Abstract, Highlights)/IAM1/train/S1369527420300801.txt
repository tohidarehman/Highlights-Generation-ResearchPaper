 The complex communities of microbes that constitute the human microbiome are influenced by host and environmental factors . Here we address how a fundamental aspect of human biology blood type contributes to shaping this microscopic ecosystem . Although this question remains largely unexplored we glean insights from decades of work describing relationships between pathogens and blood type . The bacterial strategies molecular mechanisms and host responses that shaped those relationships may parallel those that characterize how blood type and commensals interact . Understanding these nuanced interactions will expand our capacity to analyze and manipulate the human microbiome .

@highlight A historical perspective on associations between ABO blood type and bacteria.
@highlight Mechanisms that drive relationships between host blood type and commensal and pathogenic bacteria.
@highlight Review of conflicting evidence for an influence of host blood type on the intestinal microbiome.
@highlight How this knowledge may inform the development of microbiome targeted intervention strategies.
