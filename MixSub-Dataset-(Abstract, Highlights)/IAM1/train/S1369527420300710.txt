 Antibiotics used in combination are an effective strategy for combatting numerous infectious diseases in clinical and veterinary settings particularly as a last line therapy for difficult to treat cases . Combination therapy can either increase or slow the rate of killing broaden the antibiotic spectrum reduce dosage and unwanted side effects and even control the emergence of resistance . The administration of antibiotics in combination has been used effectively against bacterial infections for 70 years first used to treat tuberculosis . However effective antibiotic combinations and their dosage regimes have been largely determined empirically in the clinic and the molecular mechanisms underpinning how these combinations work remains surprisingly elusive . This review focuses on studies that have outlined the genetics and molecular mechanisms of action underlying antibiotic combinations as well as those that examine how resistance develops . We highlight the need for further experimentation and genetic validation to fully realise the potential of combination therapy .

@highlight Combination therapy is an important tool for tackling antibiotic resistance.
@highlight In depth molecular studies for combination therapy are lacking.
@highlight We summarise six major mechanisms mediating the effects seen in synergy and antagony.
@highlight Combination therapy resistance mechanisms are complex on a population level.
@highlight Resistance mutations relate to general as well as specific resistance strategies.
