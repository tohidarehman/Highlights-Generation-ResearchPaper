 The mesenchymal microenvironment is increasingly recognized as a major player in immunity . Here we focus on mesenchymal cells located within or in proximity to the blood vessels wall which include pericytes adventitial fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells . We discuss recent evidence that these cells play a role in tissue homeostasis immunity and inflammatory pathologies by multiple mechanisms including vascular modulation leucocyte migration activation or survival in the perivascular space and differentiation into specialized effector mesenchymal cells essential for tissue repair and immunity such as myofibroblasts and lymphoid stromal cells . When dysregulated these responses contribute to inflammatory and fibrotic diseases .

@highlight Perivascular mesenchymal cells include pericytes adventitial fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells.
@highlight Perivascular mesenchymal cells have roles in the recruitment and or activity of specific immune populations.
@highlight Subsets of perivascular mesenchymal cells act as progenitors for specialized stromal cells essential in repair and immunity.
@highlight Dysregulation of the perivascular niche contribute to chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
