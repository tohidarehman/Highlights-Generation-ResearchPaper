 Successful activation of CD4 T cells is centered around the ability of antigen presenting cells to successfully process select Class II immunodominant epitopes from exogenous antigens and to present it to cognate T cells . To achieve this newly synthesized MHC II molecules are transferred to a specialized compartment which contain both exogenous antigens and the Class II processing machinery . Here in a process known as

@highlight DO expression in medullary thymus may regulate CD4 negative selection.
@highlight DO and DM coregulate the abundance of presented self epitopes.
@highlight Lack of DO leads to an increased MOG specific CD4 T cell precursor frequency.
@highlight Lack of DO leads to increased collagen damage in CIA.
@highlight Lack of DO might control B cell antigen presentation.
