 is a model mushroom forming basidiomycete which produces basidiospores during sexual reproduction . This fungus is widely used to study fruiting body formation and development . Molecular mechanisms controlling its growth from vegetative mycelium to multicellular mature fruiting body have been studied extensively . However little is known about the underlying biological processes during germ tube outgrowth or the transition from basidiospores to multinucleate hyphae . To better understand sexual spore germination in fungi here we examined the time dependent cellular events at resting germinating and fully germinated basidiospores of

@highlight Transcriptome and sRNA seq characterized
@highlight early germ tube outgrowth.
@highlight Carbohydrate protein and energy metabolisms upregulated at germination initiation.
@highlight Glycogen and trehalose were key energy sources during germ tubes outgrowth.
@highlight MiRNA like RNAs were identified.
@highlight MilRNA roles were validated by milRNA mimic transfection and RT qPCR.
