 Mitogen activated protein kinase pathways are highly conserved from yeast to human and are required for the regulation of a multitude of biological processes in eukaryotes . A pentameric MAPK pathway known as the Fus3 pheromone module was initially characterised in

@highlight Mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK pathways are conserved in eukaryotes.
@highlight The Fus3 pheromone module is a MAPK pathway that regulates cell fusion in yeast.
@highlight Orthologous pathways regulate growth and secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi.
@highlight Orthologous pathways also regulate virulence in a wide range of plant pathogens.
@highlight MAPKs are potential drug targets and could help improve anti fungal therapies.
