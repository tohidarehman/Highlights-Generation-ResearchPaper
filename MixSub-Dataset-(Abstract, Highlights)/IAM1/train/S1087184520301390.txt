 is the foremost fungal producer of enzymes for industrial processes . Here we use fluorescent live cell imaging of germinating conidia to improve

@highlight We perform live cell imaging of germinating
@highlight conidia.
@highlight Conidia are best suited for
@highlight  mediated transformation.
@highlight Conidia undergo 23 non synchronized mitotic cycles prior to germination.
@highlight Conidia enter S phase immediately after initiation of germination.
@highlight Transformation efficiency is highest in late S phase.
