 The HOG pathway is critical for the appropriate adaptation to adverse conditions . Here we demonstrated that the deletion of

@highlight Cg
@highlight null mutants displayed enhanced sensitivity to osmotic stress 
@highlight The deletion of
@highlight resulted in increased resistance to fludioxonil 
@highlight Compatible solutes contribute to the
@highlight  dependent osmoadaptation.
@highlight Vesicle trafficking related genes were highly downregulated in the
@highlight strain.
