 Zebrafish can efficiently regenerate complex tissue structures with a highly developed innate and adaptive immune system which provides a model to investigate the roles of immune cells in tissue repair and regeneration . Two groups recently reported zebrafish mutants deficient in a forkhead box P3 ortholog which helped reveal the conserved immunosuppressive function of zebrafish FOXP3
