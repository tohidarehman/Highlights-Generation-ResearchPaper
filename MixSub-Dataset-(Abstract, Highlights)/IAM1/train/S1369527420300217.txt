 Intestinal helminth parasites present major challenges to the welfare of humans and threaten the global food supply . While the discovery of anthelminthic drugs empowered our ability to offset these harms to society the alarming rise of anthelminthic drug resistance mitigates contemporary efforts to treat and control intestinal helminthic infections . Fortunately emerging research points to potential opportunities to combat anthelminthic drug resistance by harnessing the gut microbiome as a resource for discovering novel therapeutics and informing responsible drug administration . In this review we highlight research that demonstrates this potential and provide rationale to support increased investment in efforts to uncover and translationally utilize knowledge about how the gut microbiome mediates intestinal helminthic infection and its outcomes .

@highlight We need new tools to mitigate the harm posed by anthelminthic drug resistance.
@highlight Evidence links the gut microbiome to helminthic infection and its outcomes.
@highlight The gut microbiome may mediate infection and define infection sensitivity.
@highlight Future research should determine if the gut microbiome could encode novel therapeutics or guide infection prevention methods.
