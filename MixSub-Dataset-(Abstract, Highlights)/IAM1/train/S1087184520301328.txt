 To better understand the roles of genes involved in mannan degradation in filamentous fungi in this study we searched identified and characterized one putative GH5 endo mannanase and two putative GH2 mannan degrading enzymes in

@highlight One GH5 mannanase and two GH2 mannosidases in
@highlight were characterized.
@highlight GH5 mannanase preferred galactomannan over linear mannan as a substrate.
@highlight GH2 1 mannosidase preferred short manno oligosaccharides or mannan as substrates.
@highlight Growth of mutants that lack mannanase and or mannosidases was analyzed.
