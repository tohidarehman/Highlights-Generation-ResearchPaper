 Transfer RNAs are non coding RNAs essential for protein synthesis . tRNAs are heavily decorated with a variety of post transcriptional modifications . Recent methodological advances provide new tools for rapid profiling of tRNA modifications and have led to discoveries of novel modifications and their regulation . Here we provide an overview of the techniques for investigating tRNA modifications and of the expanding knowledge of their chemistry and regulation .

@highlight Diverse chemical modifications of tRNAs tRNA modifications modulate protein synthesis.
@highlight tRNA sequencing and RNA mass spectrometry enable rapid identification of the structures and sites of tRNA modifications..
@highlight Novel modifications have been discovered in a variety of organisms.
@highlight tRNA modification frequencies are regulated by environmental conditions.
