 A myriad of microbes living together with the host constitute microbiota which possesses very diverse functions in regulation of host physiology . Recently it has been unequivocally demonstrated that microbiota regulates cancer initiation progression and responses to therapy . Here we review known pro tumorigenic and anti tumorigenic function of microbiota and mechanisms how microbes can regulate cancer cells and immune and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment .

@highlight Microbiota is important in various aspects of host physiology including regulation of cancer development and progression
@highlight Microbiota can play negative or positive effects on tumorigenesis and efficacy of therapies
@highlight Microbiota regulates tumorigenesis via few distinct mechanisms including interactions with cancer cells and tumor microenvironment
@highlight Pro tumorigenic microbiota stimulates tumor elicited inflammation alters metabolism hinder therapies and can promote genotoxicity
@highlight Anti tumorigenic microbiota outcompetes pathogenic microbes metabolically suppresses cancer facilitates immunity and therapies.
