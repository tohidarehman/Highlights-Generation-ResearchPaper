 Allergen immunotherapy leads to tolerance through multiple mechanisms that include tolerogenic dendritic cells and T and B regulatory cells . These induced cellular populations produce mediators to skew the immune response to a tolerogenic milieu that among others results in IgG4 blocking antibodies formation and lowered FcE receptors . All lead in decreased effector responses from mast cells eosinophils and basophils thus limiting the allergic inflammation . Clinically this results in better allergic rhinitis control and of importance asthma prevention . Newer approaches include modified allergens second generation adjuvants carriers and routes of administration all aiming to increased efficacy with parallel no compromise of safety .

@highlight Allergen immunotherapy mainly induces T regulatory cells and blocking IgG4 antibodies.
@highlight Tolerance induction and asthma prevention are key goals of immunotherapy.
@highlight New forms of allergens adjuvants and carriers result in increased immunogenicity.
@highlight Objective markers of efficacy biomarkers are urgently needed to follow immunotherapy.
