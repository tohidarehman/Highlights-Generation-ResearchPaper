 The immune system is capable of generating robust antibody responses to foreign antigens during infection and vaccination while simultaneously limiting antibodies to self antigens . T follicular regulatory cells are a subset of follicular T cell with specialized roles in regulating humoral immunity . Although Tfr cells have been studied for the past 10 years their roles have remained elusive . In this review we discuss the current understanding of Tfr cell functions in autoimmunity and how Tfr cells simultaneously control foreign and autoantigen specific antibody responses . We highlight new tools that enable in depth study of Tfr cells

@highlight Tfr cells regulate humoral immunity thereby controlling antibody responses.
@highlight Roles of Tfr cells have been unclear due to lack of specific tools to study them.
@highlight We propose a paradigm for how Tfr cells control foreign and autoantibody responses.
