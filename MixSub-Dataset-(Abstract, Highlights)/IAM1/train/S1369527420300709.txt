 Early life is a critical time window for the neonatal gut to be progressively populated with different bacterial species that collectively promote gut maturation . A fully developed and healthy gut microbiome in neonates is an important driver for the development of other aspects of health . Unlike the relatively stable gut microbiome in adults the developing gut microbiome in neonates exhibits higher plasticity and adaptability . This also underscores the unique window of opportunity for intervention or preventive measures to improve long term health through modulations of the gut microbiome in early life . Better understanding of the neonatal gut microbiome how it arises and how it impacts immune cell development will help us appreciate the underpinnings of immune related diseases . Here we examine recent findings on the neonatal gut microbiome and discuss their implications for understanding this important driver of the maturation of the immune system and immunity against infections in early life .

@highlight microbial stimulation modulates both prenatal and postnatal immune cell development.
@highlight Unique neonatal gut microenvironment allows for progressive colonization of selective bacteria before stabilization of the gut microbiome.
@highlight Both mode of delivery and nutritional availability heavily shape postnatal colonization of gut bacteria.
@highlight Gut microbial signals prime innate immune cells while minimizing overactivation of helper T cells through induction of regulatory T cells and sIgA.
@highlight Dysbiotic gut microbiome leads to pathobiont expansion and potential detrimental sepsis in neonates.
