 Sustainable production from seaweed has grown into an area of intense research and development . Meanwhile more than 30 million tonnes of seaweed are produced of which 70 are used as food and 30 have other applications such as feed fertilizer chemicals and energy . Towards biorefining seaweed in an environmentally friendly and economically viable manner we need efficient approaches that convert its biomass and residuals into added value products . Smart cell factories and fermentation strategies which can be integrated into future seaweed biorefineries are at the heart of the development and therefore receive increasing attention . Here we review advances in the field including novel fermentation routes from seaweed to chemicals materials pharmaceuticals fuels and energy and discuss challenges and opportunities .

@highlight Seaweed represents an important future biorefinery feedstock.
@highlight The world market has reached more than 30 million tonnes per year.
@highlight Cascaded valorization provides food feed functional materials chemicals and energy.
@highlight Metabolic engineered cell factories can convert seaweed sugars into novel products.
