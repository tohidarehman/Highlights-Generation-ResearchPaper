 High throughput screening is a critical part of any industrial strain engineering effort helping ensure the lowest cost product is produced in the shortest amount of time . Small scale testing that correlates to manufacturing scale allows rapid strain development with confidence that engineering changes are relevant at scale . In this review the current state of high throughput screening the technological advances for the next generation strain screening pipeline and options for implementation are reviewed . New technologies in cell culture and measurement are highlighted and special considerations are discussed .

@highlight High throughput screening to effectively sample and utilize biological diversity is critical to strain improvement efforts.
@highlight Correlation between small scale testing and manufacturing scale ensures only relevant improvements are further tested.
@highlight Small scale culture tools and rapid molecule agnostic detection technologies allow larger libraries to be screened.
@highlight High quality data and cutting edge data analysis pipelines are necessary to ensure relevant improvements are identified.
@highlight These technological advances match throughput of diversity generation with that of strain testing.
