 Protein O mannosyltransferases have been identified in fungi but not in plants and nematodes which makes PMTs become attractive targets for developing a new strategy against phytopathogens . Three PMTs have been identified in

@highlight Protein O mannosylaion is catalysed by three protein O mannosyltransferases PMT1 PMT2 and PMT4 in
@highlight Deletion of each
@highlight gene induces differential phenotype and attenuated virulence.
@highlight Comparative glycoproteomics analysis reveals that different PMTs act on different protein substrates.
