 Phage satellites are genetic elements that depend on helper phages for induction packaging and transfer . To promote their lifestyles they have evolved elegant and sophisticated strategies to inhibit phage reproduction which will be reviewed here . We will principally focus on the convergent interference mechanisms used by phage inducible chromosomal islands which are a family of satellite phages present in both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria . While some PICI elements have been extensively studied for their roles in virulence and antibiotic resistance recent studies have highlighted their relevance in controlling phage ecology and diversity . In many cases these interference mechanisms are complemented by additional strategies that promote the preferential PICI packaging and dissemination of these elements in nature . Since the PICI encoded mechanisms target conserved phage mechanisms we propose here that the PICIs form part of the initial innate immune system that phages must overcome to infect their bacterial host .

@highlight Phage satellites have evolved multiple and convergent strategies to inhibit phage reproduction.
@highlight Production of small phage capsids is a universal mechanism used by satellite phages to inhibit phage maturation.
@highlight Satellite phages have evolved mechanisms that promote their own packaging and transfer.
