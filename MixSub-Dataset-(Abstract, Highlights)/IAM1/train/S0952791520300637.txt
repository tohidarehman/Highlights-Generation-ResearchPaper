 The dialog between microbes and immune cells is critical for the establishment and maintenance of immune homeostasis . Bacterial derived metabolites or structural components initiate immune signaling pathways and transcriptional factors inducing a broad range of specificities and functional repertoires of the immune cells . Conversely the immune system regulates the composition and function of bacterial communities . Elements of the adaptive immunity including maternal antibodies and mucosal antibody responses play crucial roles in protecting the hosts from pathogens in addition to promoting colonization of symbiotic bacteria at mucosal surfaces . The complex interactions set from an early stage in life between the microbiota and adaptive immunity impact other major physiological systems . In this review we summarize recent advances in our understanding of how gut bacteria regulate systemic homeostasis by highlighting the finely orchestrated interactions between gut bacteria immune responses and the nervous system .
