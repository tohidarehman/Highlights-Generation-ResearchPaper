 The ancient DNA revolution provided diverse fields with an unprecedented opportunity to look back into the past and shed light on research aspects that were until now subject to speculation and inference from modern data . In particular enrichment methods that allow the targeted retrieval of millions of SNP positions from ancient human genomes or even complete bacterial and viral genomes have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of host pathogen interactions . Ancient DNA combined with new bioinformatic tools now even allows actual allele calling for immunogenetic systems such as Human Leukocyte Antigen across time and space . The coming years will provide us with frequency data of human immunity genes such as HLA as well as genome wide data of ancient pathogens from many time periods of human history and will therefore provide us with a dynamic view on historical human adaptation to pathogen exposure on a population wide scale .

@highlight Ancient DNA aDNA allows researchers to study selection before and after selection events.
@highlight HLA and KIR typing will help understand the mechanisms of selection in humans during such events.
@highlight The most important questions regarding pathogen driven selection in humans are yet to be solved.
@highlight Studying immunogenetics and selection using aDNA in the coming years will draw a better picture on pathogen driven selection in humans.
