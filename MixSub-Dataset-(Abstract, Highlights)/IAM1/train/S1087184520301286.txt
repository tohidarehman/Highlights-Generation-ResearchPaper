 Functions of most Hsp70 coding genes remain unknown in filamentous fungi . Here we show important roles of six Hsp70 homologs in

@highlight Eight of 14 Hsp70 genes are essential for viability of
@highlight Six other genes 
@highlight  are dispensable for growth and conidiation.
@highlight Virulence is more compromised in the absence of
@highlight than of
@highlight The six genes are essential for cell wall integrity and antioxidant activity.
@highlight The six genes serve as differential sustainers of multiple stress tolerance.
