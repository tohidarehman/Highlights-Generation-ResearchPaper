 forms single and mixed species biofilms on both tissue and medical devices in the host often under exposure to fluid flow giving rise to infections that are recalcitrant to treatment . The factors that drive enterococcal biofilm formation in the host however remain unclear . Recent reports in other pathogens show how surface sensing by bacteria can trigger the transition from planktonic to sessile lifestyle . Fluid flow can enhance initial adhesion but also influence quorum sensing . Biofilm specific factors as well as biofilm size and extracellular polymeric substances can compromise opsonization and phagocytosis . Bacterial interspecies synergy can create favorable conditions in the host for biofilm formation . Through these concepts we define the knowledge gaps in understanding host associated
