 Aromatics find a range of applications in the chemical food cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries . While production of aromatics on the current market heavily relies on petroleum derived chemical processes or direct extraction from plants there is an increasing demand for establishing new renewable and sustainable sources of aromatics . To this end microbial cell factories mediated bioproduction using abundant feedstocks comprises a highly promising alternative to aromatics production . In this review we provide the recent development of

@highlight Cell factories mediated bioproduction represents a renewable and sustainable alternative to aromatics production.
