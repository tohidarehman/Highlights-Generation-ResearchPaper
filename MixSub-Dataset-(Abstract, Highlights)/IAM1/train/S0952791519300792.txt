 Self tolerance of T cells is maintained by a combination of thymic negative selection and suppression by T regulatory cells both processes are driven by recognition of self MHC ligands . Treg function ensures that most T cells remain quiescent as nave cells but enables some T cells to proliferate and differentiate into cells with a memory phenotype . In this review we discuss how Tregs shape this compartmentalization of T cells into subsets of nave and MP T cells .

@highlight Thymic APC subsets display distinct roles in negative selection and Treg generation.
@highlight Nave T cells undergo slow conversion into MP T cells in response to self Ags.
@highlight Strong T cell proliferation following Treg depletion is mostly directed to self Ags.
@highlight A fraction of Tregs undergoes rapid turnover.
@highlight A diverse TCR repertoire is required for optimal Treg function.
