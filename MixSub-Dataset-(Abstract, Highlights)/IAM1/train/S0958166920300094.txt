 Synthetic biology has been transformative to the treatment of advanced hematological malignancies by chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells . A range of obstacles are now understood to limit the responses of solid epithelial derived tumors to CAR therapy . For example inefficient tumor homing and a fortified stroma can restrain the number of CAR T cells reaching the tumor bed . Upon transendothelial migration across the tumor vasculature CAR T cells face a highly suppressive microenvironment that can quickly render them hypofunctional . Safety also remains a critical issue for advancing CAR therapy of solid tumors . Innovative CAR design as well as coengineering and combinatorial treatment strategies with oncolytic adenovirus radiotherapy vaccines chemotherapy small molecules and monoclonal antibodies hold tremendous potential to support CAR T cell control of solid tumors either by directly promoting CAR T cell function or and by re programming the TME and harnessing the endogenous immune system against the tumor .

@highlight CAR T cells face a battery of suppressive barriers in the solid tumor microenvironment.
@highlight Safety efficacy and specificity can be engineered directly into CAR design.
@highlight Innovative coengineering strategies can be used to improve CAR T cell function.
@highlight Co administration of traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy can synergize with CAR T cells for enhanced tumor control.
