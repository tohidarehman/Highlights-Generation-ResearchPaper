 The cyclic GMPAMP synthase Stimulator of Interferon Genes pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing allows mammalian cells to detect and respond to infection with diverse pathogens . Pathogens in turn encode numerous factors that inhibit nearly all steps of cGASSTING signal transduction . From masking of cytosolic DNA ligands to post translational modification of cGAS and STING and degradation of the nucleotide second messenger 23 cGAMP pathogens have evolved convergent mechanisms to evade cGASSTING sensing . Here we examine pathogen inhibitors of innate immunity in the context of newly discovered regulatory features controlling cellular cGASSTING activation . Comparative analysis of these strategies provides insight into mechanisms of action and suggests aspects of cGASSTING regulation and immune evasion that remain to be discovered .

@highlight Pathogens evade cytosolic DNA sensing using divergent and overlapping strategies to target cGAS 23 cGAMP and STING.
@highlight Studies of pathogen mechanisms of cGASSTING evasion reveal new insights into cellular regulation of immune activation.
@highlight Newly discovered regulatory features of cGASSTING signaling suggest yet undiscovered strategies which pathogens may employ for immune evasion.
