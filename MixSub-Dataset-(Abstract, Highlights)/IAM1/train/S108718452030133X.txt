 Sexual hybridization can drive dramatic yeast evolution through the inheritance of genomic information from each parental cell . Unfortunately however a pair of strains

@highlight Mating of haploids of opposite mating types results in a new heterozygous diploid.
@highlight Pairs of yeasts with the same mating type cannot mate with each other.
@highlight Alteration with a synthetic DNA fragment to generate the desired mating type.
@highlight The generated strains inherited the phenotype of interest from the original strains.
@highlight The combination of numerous resources would be facilitated by mating type alteration.
