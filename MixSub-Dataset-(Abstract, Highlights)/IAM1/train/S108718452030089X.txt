 Evolution favors the emergence of locally adapted optimum phenotypes that are likely to differ across a wide array of environmental conditions . The emergence of favorable adaptive characteristics is accelerated in agricultural pathogens due to the unique properties of agro ecosystems . We performed a Q

@highlight QST FST study of 164 strains using image phenotyping and full genome sequences.
@highlight Natural selection and genetic drift on quantitative traits.
@highlight Local adaptation against fungicides and high temperatures among populations.
@highlight Melanization was found to be under stabilizing selection.
@highlight Trade off between melanization and growth rates at high temperature.
