 The global demand for high quality protein rich foods will continue to increase as the global population grows along with income levels . Aquaculture is poised to help fulfill some of this demand and is thus the fastest growing animal protein industry . A key challenge for it though is sourcing a sustainable renewable protein ingredient . Single cell protein products protein meals based on microbial or algal biomass have the potential to fulfill this need . Here we review potential sources of SCP strains and their respective production processes highlight recent advances on identification of new SCP strains and feedstocks and finally review new feeding trial data on important aquaculture species specifically Atlantic salmon rainbow trout and whiteleg shrimp .

@highlight SCP can be produced from microalgae yeast bacteria or protists.
@highlight Each SCP source has its own unique advantages.
@highlight A wide array of renewable sustainable feedstocks can be used to make SCP meals.
@highlight Commercial SCP products are currently being manufactured and sold.
@highlight SCP meals have been successfully used with many important aquaculture species.
