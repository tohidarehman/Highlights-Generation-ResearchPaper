 Immunological memory is defined by the ability of the host to recognise and mount a robust secondary response against a previously encountered pathogen . Classic immune memory is an evolutionary adaptation of the vertebrate immune system that has been attributed to adaptive lymphocytes including T and B cells . In contrast the innate immune system was known for its conserved non specific roles in rapid host defence but historically was considered to be unable to generate memory . Recent studies have challenged our understanding of innate immunity and now provides a growing body of evidence for innate immune memory . However in many species and in various cell types the underlying mechanisms of immune memory formation remain poorly understood . The purpose of this review is to explore and summarise the emerging evidence for immunological memory in plants invertebrates and vertebrates .

@highlight In recent years the ability to form immunological memory has been described in many taxa including plants invertebrates and vertebrates.
@highlight Innate immune and non immune cells including NK cells ILCs macrophages and epithelial cells have now been reported to possess features of immunological memory.
@highlight Epigenetic modifications play important roles in memory formation in immune and non immune cells.
