 Securing sufficient food for a growing world population is of paramount importance for social stability and the well being of mankind . Recently it has become evident that fungal pathogens pose the greatest biotic challenge to our calorie crops . Moreover the loss of commodity crops to fungal disease destabilises the economies of developing nations thereby increasing the dimension of the threat . Our best weapon to control these pathogens is fungicides but increasing resistance puts us in an arms race against them . New anti fungal compounds need to be discovered such as mono alky lipophilic cations described herein . Collaborations between academia and industry are imperative to establish new and efficient ways to develop these new fungicides and to bring them to the market place .

@highlight Fungi pose the greatest biotic challenge to global food security.
@highlight Monocultures are ideal fungal pathogen feeding and breeding grounds.
@highlight Single target site fungicides are our best defence but resistance has emerged.
@highlight We need new fungicides to out compete the pathogens in the arms race.
@highlight Academic and industrial collaboration could help fungicide discovery.
