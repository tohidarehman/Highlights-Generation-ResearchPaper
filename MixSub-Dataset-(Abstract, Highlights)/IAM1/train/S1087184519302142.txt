 has been employed in the industrial production of cephalosporin C . However there are still some impediments to understanding the regulation of CPC biosynthesis and improving strains due to the difficulty of genetic manipulation in

@highlight An improved CRISPR Cas9 system based on a chimeric promoter.
@highlight This system shows a high efficiency for gene disruption in
@highlight A large DNA fragment was deleted at a high efficiency by the system.
@highlight Blocking the sorbicillinoid biosynthesis increases the CPC production.
