 MicroRNAs are endogenous noncoding RNAs that can regulate gene expression . However little information is known about milRNAs and their target genes in

@highlight For the first time Identied the milRNAs and their targets experimentally in
@highlight Identified many miRNA features that may be unique to basidiomycetes.
@highlight The milRNAs functions are developmental stages dependent.
@highlight Different mechanism of regulation for miRNA might be present.
@highlight Conserved miRNA biosynthesis and processing machineries are present in basdiomycetes.
