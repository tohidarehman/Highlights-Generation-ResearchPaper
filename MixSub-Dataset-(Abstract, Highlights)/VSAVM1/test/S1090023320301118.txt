 Surface electrodes have been used in electromyography and nerve conduction studies in human and veterinary medicine but comparisons have not been made between surface and needle electrode recordings in dogs . Our aim in this method comparison study was to determine whether surface electrodes captured larger compound motor action potentials than needle electrodes . Tibial nerve CMAP from 25 dogs with normal limb function was acquired using both surface and needle recording electrodes the stimulus was elicited with monopolar concentric needles . Paired Wilcoxon signed rank test or a paired two tailed

@highlight Needle and surface electrodes were used to obtain muscle action potentials in dogs.
@highlight Muscle action potential amplitude was larger with needles compared to surface.
@highlight Falsely low small compound action potential amplitudes were seen in 2 25 cases.
