 Cellular adaptation to a hypoxic microenvironment is essential for tumour progression and is largely mediated by HIF 1 and hypoxia regulated factors including CXCR4 VEGF A and GLUT 1 . In human osteosarcoma hypoxia is associated with resistance to chemotherapy as well as with metastasis and poor survival whereas little is known about its role in canine osteosarcoma . This study aimed primarily to evaluate the prognostic value of several known hypoxic markers in cOSA . Immunohistochemical analysis for HIF 1 CXCR4 VEGF A and GLUT 1 was performed on 56 appendicular OSA samples correlations with clinicopathological features and outcome was investigated . The second aim was to investigate the in vitro regulation of markers under chemically induced hypoxia CoCl

@highlight HIF 1 protein expression correlated with poor prognosis in canine osteosarcomas.
@highlight CoCl
@highlight  induced HIF 1 stabilisation in canine osteosarcoma cell lines.
@highlight GLUT 1 transcription was significantly upregulated by hypoxia mimicry.
@highlight Canine osteosarcoma is an excellent comparative oncology model.
