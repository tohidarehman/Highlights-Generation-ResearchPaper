 Few data are published about different ferret husbandry practices in terms of housing enrichment feeding social management and the health status of ferrets . However these factors are crucial for animal welfare and influence animal behavior . A comprehensive online survey was conducted among 573 German speaking ferret owners to gain insight into these aspects of husbandry the occurrence of behaviors potentially indicative of good or impaired welfare and associations between environmental conditions and ferret behavior . To reduce reactance in participants a forced choice answer format was avoided therefore the sample size varied . Ferrets were on average 3.3 2.3 years old . 56 were male and 44 were female . 89 of the male and 83 of the female ferrets were neutered . Many ferrets enjoyed good health . Most ferrets were not diagnosed with a ferret typical illness . A high percentage of animals were housed in a dedicated ferret room or unconfined in the flat or house . The vast majority had various enrichment items in their main living area . Potential stressors and welfare issues were also identified recent bite injuries from other ferrets ferret typical diseases such as cardiac disease and adrenal tumors or recent signs of ill health such as diarrhea or parasites and potential problem behaviors which might strain the human animal relationship such as defecation outside the toilet area . The mean age of the latest deceased ferret was 5.8 2.6years hinting at a shorter life span than often predicted . Both housing type and recent changes in the pair or group composition that is in the social environment were shown to have an effect on behavior . For instance repetitive nibbling was reported more often in ferrets living in indoor enclosures compared with animals kept in ferret rooms unconfined in the flat house or outdoor enclosures
