 Atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure is associated with a high risk of mortality and shorter survival times in human and veterinary medicine . A retrospective review of medical records was performed to evaluate the impact of AF on survival times in Doberman Pinschers with dilated cardiomyopathy . Time of first onset of CHF and its role as a prognostic factor were also determined as were predictors of AF development .

@highlight Atrial fibrillation AF was identified in 48 of clinically overt Doberman Pinschers DP .
@highlight AF was a negative prognostic factor in DP with overt dilated cardiomyopathy DCM .
@highlight AF was only present in dogs with biventricular and right atrial RA dilation.
@highlight RA dilation was the only significant predictor of AF after multivariate analysis.
@highlight Survival time was significantly shorter in DP with AF 22 days than without AF 98 days .
