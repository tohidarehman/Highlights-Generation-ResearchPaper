 The aim of this study was to investigate the analgesic efficacy of a preoperative acupuncture treatment in 24 client owned dogs undergoing thoracolumbar hemilaminectomy . Dogs were randomly assigned to either group A or group C . Before skin incision group A was treated with acupuncture performed under general anaesthesia for 30 min . Rescue intraoperative fentanyl was administered following a 20 increase in cardiovascular parameters compared to baseline values measured before incision . An observer masked to the treatment assessed pain pre and postoperatively with the Glasgow the Colorado pain scales and a Visual Analogue Scale additionally the mechanical thresholds were measured with the Electronic von Frey Anaesthesiometer at four points located near the herniated disc . The groups were compared with respect to intraoperative cardiovascular and respiratory variables rescue fentanyl administered in total and at different surgical events drilling disc removal and skin suturing and pre and postoperative pain scores and MT .

@highlight Acupuncture decreased opioid consumption in dogs undergoing spinal surgery.
@highlight Acupuncture improved analgesia after hemilaminectomy in dogs.
@highlight Acupuncture was not associated with side effects.
@highlight Acupuncture did not increase the anaesthetic time.
@highlight Combining behavioural scales and mechanical thresholds was useful to assess pain.
