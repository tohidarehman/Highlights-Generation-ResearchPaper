 Bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 virus are major causes of bovine respiratory disease in newborn calves worldwide . Vaccination is widely used to prevent BRD and intranasal vaccines for BRSV and bPI3V were developed to overcome interference from BRSV and bPI3V specific maternally derived antibodies . Many experimental challenge trials have demonstrated that intranasal vaccines for BRSV and bPI3V are efficacious but effectiveness under field conditions has been demonstrated less often especially for newborn beef calves . The objective of this field trial was to compare the effectiveness of a newly available commercial BRSV bPI3V intranasal vaccine with that of a benchmarked one in newborn beef calves reared in a cow calf system . A total of 935 calves from 39 farms were randomized into two vaccine groups

@highlight Multicentre field trials with natural pathogen exposure complement challenge trials.
@highlight Beef calves housed with their dams were assessed for bovine respiratory disease BRD .
@highlight Two commercial intranasal live vaccines for BRSV bPI3V were evaluated.
@highlight New Vaccine A demonstrated non inferiority compared to benchmarked Vaccine B.
@highlight Difference in BRD prevalence between Vaccines A and B was 0.4 95 CI 1.6 to 0.8 .
