 The neurotransmitter Substance P and its neurokinin 1 receptor are involved in the regulation of many pathophysiological processes including emesis inflammation and nociceptive processing . This review provides a brief summary of the anti inflammatory and analgesic properties of experimental NK 1R antagonists followed by a systematic review and meta analysis on maropitant the only NK 1R antagonist with a label indication for emesis in veterinary patients . There is very limited evidence based information on the putative clinical utilisation of maropitant for pain and inflammation . The aim of this systematic review and meta analysis was to evaluate published reports on anti inflammatory analgesic and anaesthesia sparing effects of maropitant . Medline Pubmed Science direct and Web of Science were searched to identify all published studies on maropitant followed by a meta analysis .

@highlight Maropitant is a neurokinin 1 antagonist with veterinary approval for emesis.
@highlight Blocking the neurokin 1 receptor may cause analgesic and anti inflammatory effects.
@highlight Meta analyses examined analgesic and anti inflammatory effects of maropitant.
@highlight Maropitant significantly reduced minimum alveolar concentrations for anaesthetics.
@highlight Maropitant had no significant analgesic or anti inflammatory effects.
