 The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of congestive heart failure on echocardiographic variables in dogs with moderate or severe mitral valve regurgitation secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease . The secondary objective was to investigate the preliminary use of left ventricular early inflow outflow index and L waves as indicators of CHF . Forty five dogs with moderate or severe MR without

@highlight Absence of diastolic L waves indicated reduced risk of congestive heart failure CHF .
@highlight Left ventricular early inflow outflow index LVEIO was predictive for CHF.
@highlight LVEIO and L waves might be useful clinical and prognostic markers.
