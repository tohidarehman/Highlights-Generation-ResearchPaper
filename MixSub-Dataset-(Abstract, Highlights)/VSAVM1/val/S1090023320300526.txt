 The importance of atrial premature complexes as a possible marker of occult dilated cardiomyopathy in Doberman Pinschers is unknown . The aim of this study was to identify APC in healthy DP and to investigate their role as early markers of occult DCM . Holter ECG results from 561 examinations of 153 DP at different time points were retrospectively evaluated with special emphasis on APCs . Holter results from 110 healthy control DPs were compared to the last normal Holter and echocardiographic examinations in 43 DP that subsequently developed DCM within 15 months and to the first examination in the DCM group that contained ventricular premature complexes .

@highlight The presence of atrial premature complexes APCs can be normal in Doberman Pinschers.
@highlight APCs occur more frequently in older dogs than in younger dogs.
@highlight Extracardiac diseases can influence the presence of atrial premature complexes.
@highlight APCs do not increase in frequency until the dogs also have ventricular arrhythmias.
