 This study aimed to evaluate the effects of chronic subclinical mastitis on milk production and component yields in dairy cows . A total of six herds located in the Midwest area of So Paulo State Brazil were selected . Herds were visited once every 2 weeks to measure milk yield and to collect milk samples from lactating Holstein cows . Milk samples were collected at two stages and each stage comprised three milk samplings . In stage 1 a total of 117 of 647 cows were diagnosed with CSM based on at least two of three repeated somatic cell counts 2000 000 cells mL and positive bacterial milk culture results . Cows with CSM were selected for the second stage . In stage 2 selected cows had quarter sampling aseptically collected for BC analyses prior to milking and quarter milk yield was measured . Milk components were measured using mid infrared spectroscopy . Mammary quarters were considered healthy if all three repeated SCC results were 200 000 cells mL and no bacterial growth was detected on BC . All quarters with positive bacterial growth were classified as having subclinical mastitis when only one of three SCC results were 200 000 cells mL and CSM when at least two of three SCC results were 200 000 cells mL . The effects of CSM by type of pathogen on milk and components yield were assessed using a linear mixed model .

@highlight Milk loss and composition alteration depended on the pathogen causing mastitis.
@highlight Chronic quarters produced less milk than healthy quarters.
@highlight Infection with environmental streptococci reduced milk production by 1.3kg quartermilking.
@highlight Infection with
@highlight reduced milk production 0.8kg quartermilking.
@highlight Chronically infected quarters were more severely affected than subclinical and healthy quarters.
