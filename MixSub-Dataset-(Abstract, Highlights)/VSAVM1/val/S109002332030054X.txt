 This study sought to establish a baseline understanding of immune function and its association with serum vitamin D in shelter dogs . Ten apparently healthy shelter dogs housed in the Arizona Humane Society for 7 days and 10 apparently healthy age breed and sex matched control dogs were included . Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D D the major circulating vitamin D metabolite was measured using high performance liquid chromatography . Whole blood samples were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide lipoteichoic acid or phosphate buffer solution and tumor necrosis factor interleukin 6 and IL 10 were measured using a canine specific multiplex bead based assay . Phagocytosis of opsonized

@highlight Immune function and serum vitamin D concentrations was assessed in shelter dogs.
@highlight Shelter dogs had decreased phagocytic oxidative burst function compared to controls.
@highlight Serum vitamin D was weakly associated with the intensity of oxidative burst.
@highlight Serum vitamin D was moderately inversely associated with TNF production.
