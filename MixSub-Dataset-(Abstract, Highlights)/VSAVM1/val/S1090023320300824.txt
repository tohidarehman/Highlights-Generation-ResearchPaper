 The purpose of this study was to develop a computer aided detection device based on convolutional neural networks to detect cardiomegaly from plain radiographs in dogs . Right lateral chest radiographs

@highlight Convolutional neural networks were developed to detect radiographic cardiomegaly.
@highlight Diagnostic accuracy of different neural network models was calculated.
@highlight All the included architectures had an area under the curve above 0.9.
@highlight Computer aided detection of radiographic cardiomegaly could assist veterinarians.
