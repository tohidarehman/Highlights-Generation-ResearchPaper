 Portosystemic shunts are congenital or acquired vascular anomalies that cause blood to bypass the liver . Liver function tests such as fasting ammonia ammonia tolerance test and serum bile acids are reliable for the diagnosis of PSS in dogs . Surgical attenuation is a common treatment for congenital PSS . Following surgical attenuation it is useful to evaluate shunt closure . In this critical review the ability of liver function tests to determine the presence and degree of residual shunting following surgical attenuation of canine PSS is discussed . Despite the availability of several liver function tests a single rapid simple cost effective sensitive and specific test to evaluate surgical attenuation of PSS is not available .

@highlight Advanced medical imaging can be used to assess portosystemic shunt PSS closure.
@highlight Limited data exist regarding accuracy of liver function tests following PSS closure.
@highlight No reference standard exists to assess the presence and degree of residual shunting.
