 The cessation of milking at the end of lactation is a routine management practice in dairy herds and the importance of the dry period for milk production and udder health has long been recognized . Among countries and herds drying off practices differ and include various milk cessation methods such as changes in milking frequency and in feeding the use of antibiotic dry cow therapy and teat sealants and changes in housing . Published studies reporting methods of stopping milk production are scarce and there are no uniform recommendations on optimal procedures to dry cows off for good udder health cow welfare and milk production . This review describes methods to stop mik production to prepare cows for the dry period and their effects on mammary involution udder health and dairy cow welfare . Milk yield at dry off is important for rapid involution which stimulates the immune system and promotes good udder health and cow welfare . Based on the findings of this review gradual cessation of milking over several days before the final milking can effectively reduce milk yield at dry off and accelerate mammary gland involution while maximizing cow comfort and welfare . Data from this review indicate a target production level of 15 kg day of milk or less at dry off .

@highlight High milk yield at dry off increases the risk of milk leakage and intramammary infections.
@highlight Gradual cessation of milking at the end of lactation lowers milk yield at dry off.
@highlight Gradual cessation of milking accelerates mammary involution and elevates natural protective factors in mammary secretions.
@highlight Gradual cessation of milking reduces intramammary pressure stress and discomfort after dry off and improves cow welfare.
@highlight Target production level at dry off should be 15 kg d of milk or less.
