 Endometrial cytobrush cytology has been recommended as a reliable method for determining the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in cattle smears to diagnose cytological endometritis . In this study the clarity of cytobrushcytological smears and the influence of different sample evaluation methods on CE diagnosis were evaluated . Samples from 28 lactatingHolstein cows were collected weekly between 3 and 7 weeks postpartum . Smear clarity based on cell density quality of cell morphology and red blood cell contamination was significantly poorer at 3 weeks than between 5 and 7 weeks postpartum . Fivedifferent cell counting methods were used where 100500 nucleated cells were counted . Agreement of diagnostic results for CE between C300 and C500 and between C400 and C500 was excellent at all observation times . In calculations of the PMN based on whether the number of lymphocytes and macrophages were or were not excluded in the denominator exclusion of these cells in the calculations did not affect the diagnosis of CE . While reduced clarity in earlier stage samples might interfere with the accuracy of cytobrush cytology C300 can be recommended to determine the endometrial PMN .

@highlight Cytological endometritis CE causes subfertility in lactating dairy cows.
@highlight Cytobrush cytology CC has been recommended for diagnosing CE.
@highlight A sequential description of CC during the early postpartum period is needed.
@highlight Early 3 weeks postpartum smear clarity was reduced affecting the accuracy of CC.
@highlight Counting 300 cells is recommended for diagnosing CE at 37 weeks postpartum.
