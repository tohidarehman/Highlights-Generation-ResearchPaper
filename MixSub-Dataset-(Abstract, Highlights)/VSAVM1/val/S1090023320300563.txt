 A randomised controlled trial was carried out in four dairy herds located in the UK to evaluate the effect of pegbovigrastim treatment on the incidence of antimicrobial treatments during the first 30 d of lactation . Medical treatment records were analysed and treatments identified where an antibiotic product was used . Records were available for 1865 cows 933 of which received two injections of pegbovigrastim given approximately 14 d prior to expected calving and again within 24 h of calving . 932 cows received no treatment . In total 11.6

@highlight Incidence of early lactation antibiotic treatment in dairy cows was investigated.
@highlight Treatment with pegbovigrastim reduced antibiotic use in early lactation.
@highlight On well managed dairies the incidence of antibiotic treatment in early lactation was low.
@highlight Complex management and environmental effects on immune function require further investigation.
