 Atrial fibrillation is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia in horses with a reported prevalence up to 2.5 . The pathophysiology has mainly been investigated in experimental animal models and human medicine with limited studies in horses . Atrial fibrillation results from the interplay between electrical triggers and a susceptible substrate . Triggers consist of atrial premature depolarizations due to altered automaticity or triggered activity or local reentry . The arrhythmia is promoted by atrial myocardial ion channel alterations Ca

@highlight Atrial fibrillation AF is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia in horses.
@highlight Atrial fibrillation results from focal ectopy combined with a susceptible substrate.
@highlight Predisposing factors include chronic stretch and ion channel alterations.
@highlight The arrhythmia results in atrial remodelling promoting maintenance of fibrillation.
@highlight Time taken for reverse remodelling after cardioversion depends on duration of AF.
