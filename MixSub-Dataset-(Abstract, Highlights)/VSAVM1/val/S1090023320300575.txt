 Thus far there is a lack of scientific investigation regarding the hypothesis that biomechanical factors contribute to the cross species pathogenesis of osteochondrosis . Therefore the aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether high pressures occur in the porcine femorotibial joint . In this experimental ex vivo study the right hind limbs of seven weaned piglets were subjected to maximal joint excursions as a priori radiologically estimated . Subsequently the intra articular pressures were measured using sensors placed in both the medial and the lateral compartments of the FT joint .

@highlight Ex vivo study on intra articular pressures in the medial and lateral part of the porcine femorotibial joint.
@highlight Maximal joint excursions were related to peak pressures in femorotibial joints of weaned piglets.
@highlight Peak pressures above thresholds for matrix and vascular damage may result in osteochondrosis.
@highlight This study provides preliminary information to develop specific preventive strategies for osteochondrosis.
