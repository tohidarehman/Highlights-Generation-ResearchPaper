 Throughout the ages humans have selected different horse breeds for their locomotor capacities . Consequently the properties of equine locomotor tissues could have diversified because of the specific requirements of different disciplines . Therefore this study aimed to compare biochemical properties of tendons in different equine breeds traditionally selected for racing or sports performance . We hypothesised that tendons in racing breeds would have biochemical properties that would increase strength whereas those in sporting breeds would have more elastic properties . An ex vivo tendon tissue study comparing the common digital extensor tendon and superficial digital flexor tendon of sports horses and racehorses was performed . The SDFT and CDET from middle aged Friesian

@highlight Biochemical comparison of equine superficial digital flexor tendons and common digital extensor tendons.
@highlight Thoroughbred racehorses and sports horses Friesian and Warmblood horses were compared.
@highlight Sports horses had lower tendon collagen concentrations than Thoroughbreds but higher water content and crosslink concentrations.
@highlight Fibrillar collagen support predominates in Thoroughbreds crosslink collagen support predominates in sports horses.
@highlight The observed biochemical differences between breeds could be related to their intended locomotor performance.
