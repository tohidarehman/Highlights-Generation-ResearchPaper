 The identification of the heart rhythm during an episode of transient loss of consciousness is considered the reference standard method to elucidate the underlying aetiology . This study aimed to characterise heart rhythm in dogs during TLOC using Holter and external loop recorder monitoring . We retrospectively reviewed 24 h Holter monitoring and external loop recorder tracings from 8084 dogs . Heart rhythms from dogs that experienced TLOC during the recording was analysed to identify rhythm disturbances that occurred during episodes of TLOC . Electrocardiograms were subsequently categorised into Type 1 Type 2 Type 3 and Type 4 .

@highlight Syncopal episodes are characterized by transient global cerebral hypoperfusion.
@highlight Ventricular arrest typically results in transient loss of consciousness TLOC in dogs.
@highlight TLOC in most dogs has the characteristics of a reflex or neurally mediated syncope.
@highlight Cardiac rhythm during the TLOC associated with a neurocardiogenic mechanism in 46.7 cases.
@highlight Intrinsic rhythm disturbances of the sinus node or of the atrioventricular node in 31.5 cases.
@highlight Electrocardiographic characterization of TLOC diagnostic therapeutic and prognostic plans.
