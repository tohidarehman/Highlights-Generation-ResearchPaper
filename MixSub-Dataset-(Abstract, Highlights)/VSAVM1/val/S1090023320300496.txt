 D dimer is a peptide found in serum and is derived from the degradation of blood clots . Even though it has been analysed in human saliva D dimer has not been previously evaluated in the saliva of any veterinary species and its source and role remain unknown . The objectives of this research were firstly to validate the use of an automated method for the measurement of D dimer in porcine saliva and secondly to evaluate whether D dimer concentration changes in pig saliva after an acute stress stimulus . For this purpose a complete analytical validation of a commercially available immunoturbidimetric assay was carried out . In addition an experimental acute stress model was induced in 11 pigs based on a technique involving restraint by nose snare immobilisation for 1 min . Saliva samples were subsequently collected at different times and D dimer salivary alpha amylase and cortisol were assessed in order to evaluate changes in its concentrations after the stress induction .

@highlight D dimer was measured in porcine saliva with an automated immunoturbidimetric method.
@highlight Acute stress induced by a nose snare significantly increased D dimer in pig saliva.
@highlight A significant correlation between D dimer and alpha amylase was found.
