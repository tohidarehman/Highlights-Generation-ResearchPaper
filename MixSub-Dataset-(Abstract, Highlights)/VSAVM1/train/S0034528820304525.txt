 Tibial dyschondroplasia is a skeletal deformity disease in broilers that occurs when vascularization in the growth plate is below normal . Although blood vessels have been reported to contribute significantly in bone formation . Therefore in the current study we have examined the mRNA expression of angiogenesis related genes in erythrocytes of thiram induced TD chickens by qRT PCR and performed histopathological analysis to determine regulatory effect of recombinant Glutathione S Transferase A3 protein in response to the destructive effect of thiram following the injection of rGSTA3 protein .

@highlight Angiogenesis is disrupted destroyed in thiram induced tibial dyschondroplasia chickens.
@highlight Recombinant glutathione S transferase A3 protein rGSTA3 injection improved the vascularization of growth plate.
@highlight Most importantly integrin family genes
@highlight 2 
@highlight 2 
@highlight 5 found on higher fold change.
@highlight Comparatively the results of rGSTA3 protein injection found better on day 15 as compare to day 6.
