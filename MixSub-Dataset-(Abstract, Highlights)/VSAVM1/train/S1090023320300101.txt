 Elevated cardiac troponin T concentrations may provide evidence of myocardial injury but physiological post exercise release also occurs . Reference intervals are not fully established in horses making interpretation difficult . The aims of this study were to establish an upper reference limit for serum cTnT compare pre and post race serum cTnT concentrations and to evaluate factors that may influence these in a population of healthy race fit Standardbred racehorses . Serum samples were collected pre

@highlight Serum cardiac troponin T cTnT concentrations in race fit Standardbred horses was measured.
@highlight These data could contribute towards establishing equine serum cTnT reference limits.
@highlight The 97.5 percentile upper reference limit for cTnT was 27.4 ng L 90 confidence interval 13.132.0 .
@highlight Post race cTnT concentrations were significantly higher than pre race concentrations.
@highlight Females had higher post race cTnT concentrations than males.
