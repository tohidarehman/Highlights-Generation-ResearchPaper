 Healing of open wounds is of great medical importance . Wound healing is a complex process that aims to restore the function and structure of damaged tissue . This study was conducted to compare secondary intention healing of wounds treated daily with a topical application of commercially available hyaluronic acid Manuka honey Acemannan gel or a placebo . Bilateral wounds were surgically created on the backs of six sheep . At two and six weeks post wound creation biopsies were obtained to perform histological immunohistochemical and molecular analyses of the wound site . Daily clinical evaluations were performed and weekly photographs were taken of the wounds . HA treatment promoted a physiological progression of the healing process in all wound healing phases while stimulating an abundant cutaneous adnexa and promoting rapid healing representing the most compelling treatment . MH treated wounds were slightly dry . However the main effect of MH was to promote cell proliferation and neovascularization with an overall pro inflammatory effect . Results suggest that MH treatment enhances the healing process . AG treatment dehydrated the wounds and stimulated late granulation tissue and cell proliferation . Moreover AG treated wounds produced a mild late pro inflammatory and neovascularization effect . Our data indicate that AG treatment can have a positive influence on moist wounds with abundant granulation tissue and exudate .

@highlight Application of hyaluronic acid HA acemannan gel AG and M. honey MH in skin wounds developed different grades of efficacy.
@highlight the application of AG is useful in wounds with abundant granulation tissue elevate moisture and abundant exudate.
@highlight MH brings benefits when the wound is chronic.
@highlight HA is the best solution for important acute wounds where the priority is the reduction of healing time.
