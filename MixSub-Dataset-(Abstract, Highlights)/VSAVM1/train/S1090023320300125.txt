 Degenerative lumbosacral stenosis in dogs frequently involves L7 S1 foraminal stenosis and L7 nerve root compression . Surgical techniques to decompress the L7 nerve root include foraminotomy and intervertebral distraction . The objective of this study was to compare the effect of foraminotomy and intervertebral distraction on the total cranial and caudal compartmental volumes of the L7 S1 intervertebral neurovascular foramen . CT images were obtained from eight canine lumbosacral specimens in the following sequential conditions native spine after dorsal laminectomy and partial discectomy of L7 S1 after L7 S1 foraminotomy after distraction with an interbody cage between L7 and S1 after cage distraction stabilized with pedicle screw rod fixation in neutral and flexed position . The volume of the complete NF and its cranial and caudal subcompartments were calculated using the CT images and statistically compared between conditions .

@highlight Surgical treatments for lumbosacral foraminal stenosis include foraminotomy and distraction stabilization.
@highlight Both foraminotomy and distraction stabilization caused an enlargement of the lumbosacral intervertebral neurovascular foramen.
@highlight Foraminotomy and distraction stabilization caused an enlargement of the lumbosacral intervertebral neurovascular foramen.
@highlight Only foraminotomy enlarged the subcompartment of the intervertebral neurovascular foramen where the L7 nerve root was located.
@highlight Foraminotomy was more effective for treating nerve root compression caused by foraminal stenosis.
