 The feed restriction of pigs aims to improve the nutrient utilization of the diet reduce carcass fat and increase lean meat . Immunocastration is a painless reversible technique that improves animal welfare decreases boar taint in meat leading to lower fat deposition and increases lean meat . This study aimed at evaluating either feeding programs and castration categories in terms of pig performance carcass traits and meat quality . Castration category and FP did not influence marbling initial pH and drip loss in loin and ham . However immunocastrated pigs presented lighter loins and hams with lower ultimate pH compared to the surgically castrated pigs . The FP with lower feed volume resulted in higher ultimate pH . Immunocastrated males had a higher live weight than those surgically castrated . Also the more the feed supply decreased the better the feed conversion . Immunocastrates had lower carcass yields however these pigs had their backfat thickness decreased and lean meat increased in the carcass without affecting the loin depth .
