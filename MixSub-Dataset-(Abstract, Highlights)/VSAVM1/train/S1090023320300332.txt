 The enzyme 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzyme 2 is responsible for converting the active glucocorticoid cortisol to inactive cortisone and in the renal medulla protects the mineralocorticoid receptor from activation by cortisol . Derangements in 11BHSD2 activity can result in reduced conversion of cortisol to cortisone activation of the MR by cortisol and consequently sodium and water retention . The objective of this study was to examine glucocorticoid metabolism in canine congestive heart failure specifically to evaluate whether renal 11BHSD2 activity and expression were altered . Dogs were prospectively recruited into one of two phases the first phase

@highlight 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 expression was not altered in canine heart failure.
@highlight 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 activity was not altered in canine heart failure.
@highlight 20 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was elevated in canine heart failure.
@highlight Total serum cortisol was not altered in canine congestive heart failure.
