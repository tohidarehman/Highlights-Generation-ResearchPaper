 Presentation of viral epitopes by swine MHC I to cytotoxic T lymphocytes is crucial for swine immunity . The SLA 2 structure however remains largely unknown . To illustrate the structural basis of swine CTL epitope presentation the crystal structure of SLA 2 04 02 02 complexed with one peptide derived from foot and mouth disease virus was analyzed in this study . SLA 2 04 02 02 and swine 2 microglobulin were refolded

@highlight Structure of swine leukocyte antigen 2 SLA 2 was analyzed.
@highlight A potential FMDV epitope was identified with SLA 2.
@highlight Results are relevant to development of an FMDV vaccine.
