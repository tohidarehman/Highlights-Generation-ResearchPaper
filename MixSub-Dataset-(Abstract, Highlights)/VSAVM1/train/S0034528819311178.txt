 The aim of this study was to gain an overview of the protocols of food preference tests in cats through a systematic review assess the effects of test duration time of day and sex and propose a statistical approach based on power analysis to determine sample size and analyze the results . The manuscripts included in this review had marked variations in the number of days sample size feeding times and number of meals per day during the test . Additionally to the literature review three palatability tests were conducted with 40 cats to assess the effects of test duration time of day and gender on the results . From the second day of the test the sensitivity of the results was higher because on the first day the results in one of the tests differed from the others

@highlight Food preference tests for cats lack standardization
@highlight Sample size and variance are critical to determining food preferences.
@highlight Sex and test duration do not influence the results of preference tests.
@highlight Statistical power is critical in palatability studies.
