 The use of biological immunostimulants is considered a valuable practice to improve culture conditions in aquaculture sector that may help to increase production and maintain healthy environment . We undertook this study in order to evaluate the potential effect of the administration of two exopolysaccharides EPLB and EPB derived from potential probiotic strains on immune and antioxidant status of European sea bass

@highlight Bacterial exopolysaccharide EPS as anti bacterial anti biofilm and anti oxidant agent
@highlight EPS didn t affect nutritional value and modulate immune and antioxidant status.
@highlight EPS can improve culture conditions and maintain healthy environment.
