 In Icelandic horses high long hooves with added weights are often used to improve gait quality in competitions . From a biomechanical point of view excessively long hooves can be problematic as they increase forces acting on the distal limb . The study aimed to determine if hoof capsule size and angle of ICE at competitions are comparable to those of Warmblood horses requiring shoeing . Hoof dimensions and balance were quantified in 13 horses of each breed at the beginning of a shoeing period allowing a baseline comparison between breeds as well as for WB at the end of a shoeing period and for ICE when shod for competition . Left front and hind hoof capsules and bony structures of the hooves were measured on lateromedial and dorsopalmar dorsoplantar radiographs at BSP ESP and COMP respectively using the software Metron Hoof Pro .

@highlight Hoof size related to withers height and distal phalanx size was relatively larger in Icelandic horses than in Warmbloods.
@highlight Hoof capsule relative to distal phalanx size may be used in addition to withers height to assess individual hoof size.
@highlight Hoof size with an Icelandic competition shoeing was relatively larger than hooves of Warmbloods after a shoeing period.
@highlight Front hoof balance was better in Warmblood horses compared to Icelandic horses at all measurement points.
