 Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is an important etiology of mortality and morbidity in dogs and its diagnosis relies on systolic dysfunction chambers dilation electrical instability and congestion . During the last decades veterinary cardiologists have been joining efforts to obtain diagnostic resources to correctly identify canine DCM in the preclinical stage . Unfortunately most diagnostic resources have been used with the support of research with weak evidence without high quality methodologies such as systematic reviews or meta analysis . Therefore the support of evidence based medicine is tailored by empiricism and diagnostic criteria lose out the ability to properly classify dogs suffering DCM . The presentation of the evidence in medicine is established by multiple sources and the most reliable source has been the presentation of evidence based medicine from systematic reviews and meta analysis . Rapid reviews can be interpreted as a pragmatic approach to systematic reviews and although a rapid review follows most of the critical steps of a systematic review to provide timely evidence some components of a systematic review process are either simplified or omitted . The objective of this narrative evidence based rapid review is twofold . First To recognize and to stratify the level of evidence offered by rigorous selected papers about the diagnosis of DCM . Second To classify the degree of clinical recommendation of the diagnostic resources available .

@highlight There is a lack of studies for diagnosis of DCM offering the highest level of evidence.
@highlight cTnI measurement to rule out preclinical stage of DCM must be not recommended.
@highlight The assessment of NT proBNP is not recommended to detect DCM in preclinical stage.
@highlight biplanar Simpson s method of discs must be considered as gold standard tests
@highlight narrative evidence base rapid review is not an attempt to create guidelines.
