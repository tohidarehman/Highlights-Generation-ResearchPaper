 The dog has been used extensively as an experimental model to study meniscal treatments such as meniscectomy meniscal repair and regeneration . Accurate quantification of meniscal size and morphology are a crucial step for developing models of the meniscus . 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging has been found to be highly accurate in analyzing the meniscus in both clinical and research fields . However 3.0T MRI systems are still uncommonly used in veterinary medicine . The goal of the study was to compare meniscal volume measurements from 1.5T MRI system with 3.0T MRI system using proton density sequence a clinically relevant protocol . The MR images were segmented to reconstruct 3D surface representations of both medial and lateral menisci to compare the meniscal volumes measurements . Average volume differences were 8.8

@highlight MR meniscal volume measurements from 1.5T and 3.0T MRI systems using a clinically relevant protocol were compared.
@highlight Meniscal volumes showed no significant differences between MRI magnet strength image views and different stifle positions.
@highlight 1.5T MRI is as accurate as a 3T MRI for meniscal volume measurements.
@highlight Meniscal volume measurements from both MRI systems showed high inter and intraobserver reproducibility.
