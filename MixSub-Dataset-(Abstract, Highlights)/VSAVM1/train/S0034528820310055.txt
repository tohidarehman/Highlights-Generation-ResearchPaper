 Calf bronchopneumonia is accompanied by increased level of circulating immune complexes and we analysed size and protein and lipid constituents of these CIC with an attempt to elucidate the connection between the CIC structural properties and their capacity to modulate leukocyte function .

@highlight CIC level is elevated in calf bronchopneumonia.
@highlight CIC IgG of healthy and diseased calves specifically bind 75 and 80kDa proteins.
@highlight In healthy and diseased calves CIC predominate oleic acid containing phospholipids.
@highlight CIC of diseased calves contain larger particles than CIC of healthy ones.
@highlight CIC of healthy and diseased calves differently modulate leucocyte function.
