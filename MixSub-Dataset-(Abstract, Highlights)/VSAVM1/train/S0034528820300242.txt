 Hepatitis hydropericardium syndrome caused by hypervirulent fowl adenovirus 4 have been causing great economic losses to Chinese poultry industry since 2015 . Elucidation of the pathogenesis of FAdV 4 will lay solid foundation for developing attenuated FAdV 4 vaccine and vaccine vector . Our previous study has demonstrated that the increased virulence of hypervirulent FAdV 4 was associated with fiber 2 and hexon genes . However the roles of fiber 1 and penton in virulence of FAdV 4 have never been elucidated . To further investigate the roles of the major structural proteins fiber 1 and penton in the virulence of hypervirulent FAdV 4 the fiber 1 and penton replaced mutant viruses were constructed based on the FAdV 4 infectious clones of hypervirulent strain HNJZ using Red recombineering techniques . The pathogenicity of the rescued viruses was evaluated in 3 week old SPF chickens . Chickens infected with the rescued recombinant viruses carrying the fiber 1 or penton base gene from a nonpathogenic strain ON1 developed similar clinical signs to the natural hypervirulent FAdV 4 infection including HHS indicative gross lesions and histopathological changes in sick dead chickens . Our results suggested that the increased virulence of hypervirulent FAdV 4 was independent of fiber 1 and penton . The detailed pathogenesis of FAdV 4 and the roles of fiber 1 and penton in the viral replication and infection process need to be further explored .

@highlight Fiber 1 and penton replaced FAdV 4 mutants were rescued for the first time.
@highlight Roles of fiber 1 and penton in the virulence of FAdV 4 were first reported.
@highlight Virulence of hypervirulent FAdV 4 was independent of the fiber 1 and penton.
