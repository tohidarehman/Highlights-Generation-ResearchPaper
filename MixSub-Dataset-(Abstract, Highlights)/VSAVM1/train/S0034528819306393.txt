 Bats are a poorly understood reservoir of pathogenic and multi drug resistant microorganisms therefore the aim of the study was to analyze the presence of drug resistance among

@highlight Isolation on selective media increases the percentage of multidrug resistant isolates.
@highlight The ADSRRS method is a useful tool in differentiating isolates from the same source.
@highlight The percentage of resistant strains from pooled and single samples is comparable.
@highlight Bats are a significant reservoir of resistant
@highlight The gene resistance profiles of bat isolates are similar to those from the human source.
