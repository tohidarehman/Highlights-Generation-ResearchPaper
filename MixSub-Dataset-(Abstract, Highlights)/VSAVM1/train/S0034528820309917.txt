 The effects of different doses of orally administered sildenafil on pulmonary haemodynamics in dogs with pulmonary hypertension have not been documented in an invasive and quantitative manner . In this study we examined the effects of oral sildenafil using a canine model of chronic embolic PH . This CEPH model was created by repeatedly injecting microspheres through a catheter into the pulmonary artery under general anaesthesia at regular weekly intervals over several months . The CEPH dogs received 1 2 or 4mg kg of sildenafil orally twice a day for seven days . Then haemodynamic measurements including pulmonary artery pressure systemic artery pressure pulmonary artery wedge pressure right atrial pressure and cardiac output were obtained after seven days of sildenafil administration via right heart catheterisation and oscillometric blood pressure measurements .

@highlight The effects of different doses of oral sildenafil in a canine model of pulmonary hypertension PH were evaluated.
@highlight A PH model was created by repeatedly injecting microspheres into the pulmonary arteries.
@highlight 1 2 and 4mg kg of oral sildenafil in a canine model of PH decreased pulmonary artery pressure in a dose dependent manner.
@highlight Sildenafil decreased pulmonary vascular resistance without notable changes in systemic vascular resistance.
