 Delivery of local anaesthetic at the time of castration and tail docking could improve welfare outcomes in lambs . This study examined pain responses in lambs marked using rubber rings with or without local anaesthetic precision injected using the Numnuts instrument . On each of two commercial farms 150 prime lambs aged 4 to 10weeks balanced for sex were randomly allocated to 3 treatments handled in a lambing cradle handled and marked with rubber rings or handled and marked with rubber rings and treated with 30mg lignocaine using the Numnuts instrument . Time to mother up acute pain related behaviours at 5 20 35 and 50min and postures at 10min intervals from 60 to 180min were recorded . NNLA lambs tended to mother up more quickly than Ring lambs

@highlight The Numnuts tool effectively delivers a local anaesthetic agent to the neck of the scrotum or tail.
@highlight Reductions in active pain avoidance behaviours were evident at 5min and 20min post procedure.
@highlight The duration of efficacy is limited by the pharmacokinetics of the agent used lignocaine 2 .
@highlight Efficacy is likely to be improved if a longer lasting agent or combination of agents is used.
