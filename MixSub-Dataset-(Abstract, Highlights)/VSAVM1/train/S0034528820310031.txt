 Connexin 43 known to form gap junction transmembrane channels between the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells plays a key role in physiological functions such as regulating cell growth differentiation and maintaining tissue homeostasis . Cashmere goat is an important farm animal that provides cashmere which was produced by secondary hair follicles for human consumption however there is no report about the role of Cx43 on the growth and development of SHF in cashmere goat . In this study we investigated the effect of Cx43 on proliferation secondary hair follicle dermal papilla cells in Albas cashmere goat . In SHF DPCs Cx43 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the expression of IGF 1 whereas Cx43 knockdown was associated with the opposite effects . These results suggested that Cx43 may promote cell proliferation by inducing IGF 1 . Overall our research not only contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of the growth and development of SHF in cashmere goat but also shed light on cashmere quality control in the future .

@highlight Cx43 overexpression increased the proliferation of Tel SHF DPCs.
@highlight Cx43 knockdown attenuated the proliferation of Ana SHF DPCs.
@highlight Cx43 promote proliferation inducing IGF 1 in SHF DPCs.
