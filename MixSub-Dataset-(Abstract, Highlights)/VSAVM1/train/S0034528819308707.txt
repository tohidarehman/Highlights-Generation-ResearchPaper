 Swine respiratory disease complex causes massive economic losses to the swine industry and is a major animal welfare concern . Antimicrobials are mainstay in treatment and control of SRDC . However there is a lack of data on the prevalence and trends in resistance to antimicrobials in bacterial pathogens associated with SRDC . The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and changes in resistance to 13 antimicrobials in swine bacterial pathogens

@highlight AMR data for bacterial swine pathogens associated with SDRC are lacking
@highlight AMR data on swine bacterial pathogens collected over 11 years in the U.S.A was analyzed for changes in AMR prevalence
@highlight AMR in
@highlight and
@highlight isolates mostly remained low.
@highlight There were statistically significant changes in AMR in
@highlight and
@highlight Use of surrogate breakpoints can lead to different AMR estimates for certain bacteria
