 Caprine tuberculosis is a zoonosis with sanitary and economic repercussions . Caprine TB control programs are based on a test and cull strategy using the intradermal tuberculin tests and slaughterhouse surveillance . However this approach is not always feasible and may have a limited sensitivity under specific circumstances . In this study performance of a new experimental test based on the P22 protein complex was evaluated in two TB infected herds using milk and serum samples and compared with cell based diagnostic tests . Samples from a low

@highlight The P22 ELISA using milk and serum samples showed a similar sensitivity in goats.
@highlight The different milk preservation procedures tested did not affect the ELISA results.
@highlight Milk was a valuable sample for diagnosis of TB in goats using antibody based tests
