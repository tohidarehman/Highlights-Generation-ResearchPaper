 Isoflavones such as genistein have been proposed to have beneficial effects on health including preventive or therapeutic actions in carcinogenesis . Their structural similarity to oestrogens allows them to bind at the cellular level with oestrogen receptors . Therefore this study attempted to determine the antitumoural effects of genistein administered in a canine inflammatory mammary cancer xenograft model in terms of tumour proliferation appearance of metastases and steroid hormone regulation . Using histology and immunohistochemical analyses as well as the EIA technique for hormonal determinations the antitumoural effects of genistein on an inflammatory mammary cancer xenograft model were assessed for 3weeks .

@highlight Genistein administration promotes tumour proliferation in canine mammary cancer xenografts.
@highlight Genistein promotes a serum and intratumoral elevation of estrogens levels.
@highlight Genistein enhances metastatic rate in canine mammary cancer xenografts.
