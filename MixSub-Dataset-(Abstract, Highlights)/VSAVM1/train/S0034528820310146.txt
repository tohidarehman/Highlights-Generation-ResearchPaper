 The present study was conducted on Karan Fries cows to identify SNPs in breast cancer 1 gene and their association with inflammation of mammary gland and production traits . Chi square analysis showed significant association of both SNPs i.e . G43737229T

@highlight Genotype GG of G43737229T SNP and AA of G43761121A SNP of BRCA1 gene was less susceptible to clinical mastitis.
@highlight The TT and GT genotypes G43737229T in Karan Fries cows were associated with higher milk yields P 0.01 and first lactation length P 0.05 .
@highlight G T haplotype and GGTT combined genotype found to be more prone to mastitis incidences.
