 The concern over increasing resistance to tetracyclines such as tetracycline and chlortetracycline necessitates exploration of new approaches to combating infection in antimicrobial therapy . Given that bacteria use the chemical language of autoinducer 2 signaling molecules in order to communicate and regulate group behaviors we asked whether the AI 2 signaling influence the tetracyclines antibiotics susceptibility in
