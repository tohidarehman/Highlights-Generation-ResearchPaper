 One option for controlled weight loss for dogs and cats in overweight condition could be to modestly restrict caloric intake using a reduced energy maintenance diet but there is no prior research on the safety and efficacy of such an approach . A prospective observational cohort study was performed in 67 overweight dogs and 17 overweight cats undergoing weight loss using reduced energy maintenance diets from one manufacturer . Diets were fed at approximately 80 of maintenance energy requirements for ideal bodyweight for a period of 8weeks . Essential nutrient intake was estimated for each dog and cat and compared with minimum requirement or adequate intake as set by the National Research Council in 2006 . Weight loss was seen in 56 67 dogs losing a median of 4.7 of their starting body weight . Weight loss was also seen in all 17 cats losing a median of 6.4 of SBW . Of the essential nutrients examined only selenium choline potassium and riboflavin were less than NRC recommendations in a minority of animals . However no signs of any nutrient deficiency were observed in any of the dogs or cats during the study . In summary modestly energy restricting overweight dogs and cats when feeding a low energy maintenance diet can induce weight loss and might be a useful initial step for weight management . Although no adverse effects were seen borderline intake of some micronutrients warrants further consideration .

@highlight Overweight dogs and cats lost a median of 4.7 and 6.4 bodyweight respectively when fed a reduced energy maintenance diet at marginally less than MER.
@highlight The intake of most essential nutrients remained above National Research Council recommendations.
@highlight Selenium choline potassium and riboflavin were marginally below NRC recommendations in some animals but no signs of deficiency were seen.
@highlight Owners reported improved quality of life and mobility in their cats and dogs during the study.
