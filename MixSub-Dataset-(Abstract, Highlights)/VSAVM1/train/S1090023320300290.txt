 Understanding the depolarisation pattern of the equine heart under normal physiologic conditions and its relationship to the surface electrocardiogram is of uppermost importance before any further research can be done about the pathophysiology of complex arrhythmias . In the present study a 3D electro anatomical mapping system was used to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative depolarisation patterns and correlation to the surface ECG of both the atrial and ventricular endocardium in seven healthy horses in sinus rhythm under general anaesthesia . Bipolar activation maps of the endocardium were analysed .

@highlight This is the first complete 3D electro anatomical activation map in horses.
@highlight The right and left atrial depolarisation showed individual P wave deflections.
@highlight The interatrial activation pattern supported the presence of Bachmann bundle.
@highlight The complete ventricular depolarisation contributed to the ECG QRS complex.
@highlight Electrically active tissue could be found in all pulmonary veins.
