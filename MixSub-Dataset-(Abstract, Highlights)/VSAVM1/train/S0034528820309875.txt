 Oxytocin is associated with reproductive physiology but also with welfare and positive emotions . In this study oxytocin was measured in saliva samples of 45 pigs that were collected before being transported to the slaughterhouse at the time of arrival and 4h after arrival to the slaughterhouse . Two previously validated assays one that measures free oxytocin and other that measures oxytocin linked to proteins were used . In addition cortisol salivary alpha amylase total esterase activity butyrylcholinesterase and lactate dehydrogenase which are biomarkers associated with stress and pain in pigs were measured . The results showed a decrease in free and protein linked oxytocin concentrations at 4h after transport compared with the time before transport while cortisol sAA TEA BChE and LDH showed an increase at 4h after transport compared with the time before transport . Based on these results it can be concluded that the transport and lairage at slaughterhouse in the conditions of this study produce a decrease in oxytocin in the saliva of pigs that could indicate a reduced emotional well being .

@highlight Oxytocin decreases after transport and lairage at slaughterhouse in saliva of pigs.
@highlight Stress biomarkers increase after lairage at slaughterhouse in saliva of pigs.
@highlight Transport and lairage at slaughterhouse could be a stress situation for pigs.
