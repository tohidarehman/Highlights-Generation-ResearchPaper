 The ovine rumen is an immune interface with the external environment participating in host defence responses . Ovine ruminal epithelial cells not only have a physical barrier function but also secrete sheep defensin 1 which plays a key role in innate and adaptive immunity . Prebiotics are potential alternatives to infeed antibiotics .
