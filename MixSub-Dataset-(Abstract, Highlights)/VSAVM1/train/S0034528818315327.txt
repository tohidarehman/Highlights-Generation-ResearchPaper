 To examine the adaptive physiological responses to increasing salinity of drinking water in a choice situation twelve female non lactating Boer goats were used . After a control period with fresh water in phase 2 the choice between different salt concentrations and tap water was offered for two weeks . Subsequently goats were stepwise habituated to saline water by only offering the choice between salted water with different increasing concentrations for four weeks . In phase 4 the procedure of phase 2 was repeated . BW was not affected by saline water intake whereas BCS decreased . Total water intakes differed between ages

@highlight Stepwise adaptation to saline water concentrations up to 1.5 is a suitable method.
@highlight High saline water intake over a short duration had no detrimental effect on health.
@highlight Goats adapted to salt water without damage to liver and kidney functions.
@highlight Adult goats tolerate higher salt water concentrations compared to younger ones.
