 The effect of selective transcatheter arterial embolisation using trisacryl gelatine microspheres in the normal canine liver was investigated . Selective embolisation was achieved by injecting TGMs into the left hepatic artery through a microcatheter in four healthy dogs . After embolisation computed tomography biochemical analysis and histological examination were performed during a 12 week observation period . Embolisation was successful in all four dogs . Postoperative CT revealed consistent embolisation of the artery within the experimental period in three dogs . Hepatic enzyme levels slightly increased after embolisation but tapered to normal ranges . Histological examinations revealed no abnormal changes . Thus selective TAE with TGMs was well tolerated in normal dogs and may be applicable to canine hepatocellular carcinoma .

@highlight Transcatheter arterial embolisation TAE plays a vital role in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
@highlight Selective TAE with trisacryl gelatine microspheres TGMs was well tolerated in normal dogs.
@highlight The embolization with TGMs was confirmed 12weeks after treatment by post embolisation computed tomography.
