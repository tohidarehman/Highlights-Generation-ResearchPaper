 Peste des Petits Ruminants is an acute highly contagious economically important transboundary viral disease of small ruminants . The objectives of this cross sectional study were to estimate the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of PPR in small ruminants in selected districts of Horo Guduru Zone Western Ethiopia . A total of 806 blood samples corresponding to 124 flocks comprised of 387 sheep and 419 goats were collected using multi stage sampling . The sera were tested using competitive Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay . A pre tested questionnaire was used to collect data on potential risk factors for PPRV infection . Pearson s Chi Square and logistic regression analyses were used to see the association of the seroprevalence with potential risk factors . The flock level overall seroprevalence of PPR was 27.42 19.7936.15 . An overall animal level seroprevalence of 5.71 was recorded with 6.98 seroprevalence in sheep and 4.53 in goats . There was a significant association between the seroprevalence and risk factors that were sharing common grazing land

@highlight An overall flock and animal level seroprevalence of 27.42 and 5.71 respectively was estimated.
@highlight The seroprevalence of Peste des Petits Ruminants PPR in sheep and goats was 6.98 and 4.53 respectively.
@highlight Sharing grazing land the introduction of purchased animals into the flock and midland altitude are predictors of PPR seropositivity in sheep
@highlight Uncontrolled animal movements and sharing common grazing land with other flocks were the other predictors of PPR in goats.
@highlight The seropositivity in unvaccinated small ruminants suggests the circulation of the Peste des Petits Ruminants virus in the study areas.
