 Alternative treatments to surgery in canine degenerative lumbosacral stenosis remain limited and reliable predictors of outcome are lacking . The aims of this clinical trial were threefold to assess the usefulness of single epidural steroid injection in DLSS to compare the outcomes of ESI and decompressive surgery and evaluate ESI as a predictor of outcome following decompressive surgery . Dogs diagnosed with DLSS were prospectively recruited and administered an ESI . If clinical signs persisted or relapsed decompressive surgery was recommended . Follow up was obtained .

@highlight Epidural steroid injection ESI effects may show relapse within two months.
@highlight Single ESI provided long term resolution of clinical signs in some dogs 15.6 .
@highlight ESI appeared inferior to surgery according to clinical and owner perceived outcome.
@highlight Clinical response to ESI did not predict surgical outcome.
@highlight ESI can address lumbar radiculopathy particularly when surgery is not an option.
