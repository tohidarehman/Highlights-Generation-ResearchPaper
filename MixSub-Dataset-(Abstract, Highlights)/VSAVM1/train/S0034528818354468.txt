 It was the aim of the study to assess the impact of a minor surgical intervention under general anaesthesia on results of a low dose dexamethasone suppression test in dogs . Five clinically healthy dogs underwent a LDDST prior and 1 4 7 14 and 28days after a dental restoration under general anaesthesia . All LDDSTs revealed negative results . On all test days after intervention some dogs had basal cortisol concentrations below the reference range . Accordingly plasma cortisol concentrations 4 and 8h after dexamethasone injection were noticeably lower than before surgery and often even below the lower detection limit of 2.0ng ml . The study results may indicate a suppressive effect of a minor surgery under general anaesthesia on cortisol measurements during LDDSTs . It may be speculated that this could possibly lead to false negative test results in the postsurgical period although transfer of these results to clinical cases is subject to limitations .

@highlight Low dose dexamethasone suppression test is negative post surgery in dogs without HAC
@highlight Hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis maybe surprisingly long suppressed in dogs after minor surgery under anaesthesia
@highlight Low dose dexamethasone suppression test results must be carefully interpreted in the postsurgical period
