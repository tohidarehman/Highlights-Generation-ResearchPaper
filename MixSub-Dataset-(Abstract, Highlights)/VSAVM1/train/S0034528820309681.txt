 The transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes from enteric bacteria from the animal reservoir to indigenous bacteria in meat is a serious concern as it can contribute to human exposure to antimicrobial resistance genes . The aim of this study was to investigate plasmid mediated horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes from

@highlight Possible horisontal transfer of plasmids in minced meat.
@highlight Horisontal transfer is dependent on temperature.
