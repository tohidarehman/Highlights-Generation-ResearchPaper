 At Fdration Equestre Internationale competitions horses undergo veterinary inspection for judgement of fit to compete . However FEI Veterinary Delegates often differ in opinion . The aim of the present study was to evaluate intra and inter observer agreements of fit to compete judgement and compare these with objective gait analysis measurements . Twelve horses were evaluated by three experienced VDs and one veterinary specialist and video recorded for re evaluation later . Simultaneously quantitative gait analysis measurements were acquired . Inter observer agreement during live evaluations was fair
