 The objectives of this prospective study were determination of reference intervals for rotational thromboelastometry parameters in single use reagents and to evaluate correlations between plasmatic coagulation times and ROTEM parameters . Blood was sampled from a jugular vein in 49 client owned healthy dogs and ex tem S in tem S fib tem S and ap tem S parameters prothrombin time activated partial thromboplastin time fibrinogen haematology blood chemistry and venous blood gas analysis was performed . Determination of RI was performed using Excel add in Reference Value Advisor and correlations between PT aPTT and fibrinogen with selected ROTEM parameters were determined by Spearman correlation . Ex tem S maximum clot firmness RI are smaller compared to RI in people and liquid ex tem in dogs while maximum lysis was comparable to those in people but smaller than previously reported in dogs . A strong correlation was found between fibrinogen measured by Clauss and fib tem S and in tem S MCF

@highlight ROTEM parameter reference intervals from lyophilized single test vials differ from previously published liquid multi test vial RI and should not be used interchangeably.
@highlight Fibrinogen measured by Clauss correlates to fib tem S and in tem S maximum clot firmness in healthy dogs.
@highlight PT correlates moderately to extem S fib tem S and ap tem S clotting times and in tem S clot formation times in healthy dogs.
@highlight aPTT did not correlate to ROTEM S paramters in healthy dogs.
