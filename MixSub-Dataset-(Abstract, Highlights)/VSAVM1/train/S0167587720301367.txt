 France recently faced two epizootic waves of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry mainly in the fattening duck production sector . Vaccination against avian influenza is currently not authorised in France even though its potential benefits were discussed during these epizootic events . The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential efficiency of different vaccination strategies that could be applied against AI in France .

@highlight Higher poultry population immunity coverage was reached using hatchery vaccination.
@highlight Hatchery vaccination protocols provided the highest benefit cost ratio.
@highlight Vaccination strategies including only the most at risk population were not efficient.
@highlight Strategies including the highest number of birds offered the highest benefit cost ratio.
@highlight EVACS tool provides relevant evidences for decision makers to design AI vaccination strategies.
