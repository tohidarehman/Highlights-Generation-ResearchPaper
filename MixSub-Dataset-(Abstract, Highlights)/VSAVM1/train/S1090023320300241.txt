 Determining lymph node metastases in dogs with neoplasia is important in staging and developing a therapeutic plan . In this study the clinical efficacy of combined lymphosonography and strain elastography was evaluated for its ability to identify metastatic mandibular lymph nodes . Data from clinically healthy dogs

@highlight Combined lymphosonography and strain elastography evaluated mandibular lymph nodes in dogs with head and neck cancer.
@highlight Lymph nodes with filling defects after lymphosonography indicated metastasis.
@highlight Strain elastography showed more stiffness in the metastatic lymph nodes than clinically healthy and non metastatic nodes.
@highlight Lymphosonography with strain elastography predicted metastasis in lymph nodes from dogs with head and neck cancer.
