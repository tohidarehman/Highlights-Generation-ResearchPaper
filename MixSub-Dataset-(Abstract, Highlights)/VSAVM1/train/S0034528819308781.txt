 The miRNA gene in DNA is first transcribed to Pri miRNA and then processed to Pre miRNA a stem loop RNA segment and further to miRNA which binds to mRNA by Dicer protein complex . It was confirmed that goat miR 204 could regulate the expressions of Sirt1 and the SSCs important genes Oct4 and Plzf and inhibit the proliferation of dairy goat SSCs

@highlight The recombinant lentivirus vector pCDH CMV mir204 EF1 GreenPuro was structured containing goat chi pri mir 204 genel
@highlight miR 204 was detected in the mouse seminiferous tubules injected with the packaged lentiviruses containing chi pri mir 204l
@highlight The Sirt1 was down regulated in the seminiferous tubules with injected packaged lentiviruses containing chi pri mir 204
