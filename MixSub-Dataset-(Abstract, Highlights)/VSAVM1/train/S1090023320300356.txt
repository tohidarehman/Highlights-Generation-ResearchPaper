 Two sensitive assays based on AlphaLISA technology were developed and validated for the measurement of cortisol and cortisone in hair of pigs that also enabled estimation of 11 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 activity . These assays were applied to hair samples from sows

@highlight Two assays based on AlphaLISA technology were developed.
@highlight Cortisol and cortisone quantification in pig hair was enabled.
@highlight Sows were sampled at three different stages of their reproductive cycle.
@highlight Sow hair cortisone was highest at 23 days after farrowing during springsummer.
@highlight Season could influence 11 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 activity.
