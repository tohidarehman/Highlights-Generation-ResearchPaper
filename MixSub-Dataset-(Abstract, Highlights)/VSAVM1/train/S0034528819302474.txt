 Mammary tumors represent the second most common neoplasia in the canine species where more than 50 of the cases are classified as malignant . The histological classification is used as a prognostic tool . Cadherins and catenins are responsible for cell adhesion and are intrinsic connected with the process of metastasis . E cadherin expression in canine mammary tissues have been extensively studied . However the studies with catenins are still scarce in the canine species . This study evaluated 74 canine mammary tissues by assessing the expression of E cadherin and and P 120 catenin molecules using the immunohistochemistry technique and their relationship with clinicopathological parameters . Three patterns of expression were identified in this study membranous cytoplasmic and both . In benign tumors more than 80 of the cases had preserved expression and in malignant tumors 20 of the cases had reduced expression . A correlation between E cadherin and P 120 catenin expression was found as well as a significant relationship between the histological type and the expression of catenin in malignant tumors .
