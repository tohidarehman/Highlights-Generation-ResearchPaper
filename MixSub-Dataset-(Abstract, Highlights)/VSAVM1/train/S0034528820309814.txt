 This study aims to evaluate the influence of the phase behavior of microemulsions in the transdermal administration of ivermectin an antiparasitic drug widely used in the treatment of endoparasites and ectoparasites in dogs . In this regard pseudoternary phase diagrams composed of water isopropyl myristate tween 80 and labrasol were obtained in a different surfactant cosurfactant ratios . S CS in 1 3 ratio presented a larger region of microemulsion formation and three microemulsions were selected from it and characterized . Subsequently

@highlight Ivermectin microemulsions have been successfully obtained.
@highlight Phase behavior of microemulsions have influenced the skin permeation of the drug.
@highlight W O and bicontinuous microemulsions showed better transdermal effect.
@highlight O W microemulsion resulted in higher amount of drug accumulated into the skin.
@highlight O W microemulsion showed better topical effect.
@highlight Microemulsions may be promising formulations known as spot on of ivermectin.
