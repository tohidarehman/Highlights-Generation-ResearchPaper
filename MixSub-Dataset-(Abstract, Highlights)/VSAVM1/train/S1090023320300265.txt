 Infection with bovine leukaemia virus a retrovirus causes dysfunction of the immune system and can have a marked economic impact on dairy industries due to decreased milk production and reduced lifespan in affected dairy cattle . The presence of proviral DNA has been the major diagnostic indicator of BLV infection . However in the course of BLV infection the viral genome can be dormant without detectable gene expression resulting in limited impact on infected animals . At present there is limited knowledge regarding haematological indices in dairy cattle that could indicate activation of the BLV genome and suggest reactivated BLV infection . In this study BLV infection and BLV genome reactivation were evaluated based on the presence of BLV DNA and BLV

@highlight PCR assays were developed based on the
@highlight gene of bovine leukemia virus BLV .
@highlight Proviral DNA and RNA of BLV was detected by conventional PCR and BLV RNA was quantified by real time PCR qPCR .
@highlight Of 87 BLV DNA positive cattle 89.7 had BLV RNA indicating virus reactivation.
@highlight BLV RNA was significantly associated with increased white blood cell WBC and lymphocyte LYM counts.
@highlight WBC and LYM counts could be used to predict reactivation of BLV infection in asymptomatic cattle.
