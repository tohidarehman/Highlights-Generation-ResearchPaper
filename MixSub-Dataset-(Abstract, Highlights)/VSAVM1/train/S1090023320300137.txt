 Because the alveolar macrophage phenotype of horses with severe equine asthma is unknown the cytokines expressed by M1 and M2 polarized AM were determined and the hypothesis that natural hay straw challenge induces divergent AM phenotypes in control horses and horses with SEA was tested . Macrophages from control horses were activated either with eIFN lipolysaccharide or eIL 4 to characterize M1 or M2 polarized AM gene expression respectively and determine the response of polarized cells to pathogen associated molecular patterns LPS zymosan peptidoglycan and hay dust . Subsequently gene expression was explored in AM of control horses and horses with SEA at pasture and after NC .

@highlight The first investigation of alveolar macrophage phenotypes in horses with severe equine asthma.
@highlight In horses with equine asthma alveolar macrophages have a non canonical M1 M2 phenotype.
@highlight The non canonical phenotype of equine asthma persists during clinical remission induced by pasturing.
@highlight Healthy horses develop a similar non canonical phenotype only during hay feeding in a stable.
