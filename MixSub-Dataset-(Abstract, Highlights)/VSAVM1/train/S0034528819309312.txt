 Ceramides in the stratum corneum are known to play a crucial role in determining skin barrier function in dogs . We aimed to develop an

@highlight Canine keratinocytes in this culture system had stratified in conjunction with the appearance of the stratum granulosum
@highlight Synthesis of ceramide classes were increased during stratification of keratinocytes
@highlight Ceramides synthesized in this culture system were corresponding to those found in canine stratum corneum
@highlight This culture system will serve as a useful tool for further analysis of ceramide metabolism in canine keratinocytes
