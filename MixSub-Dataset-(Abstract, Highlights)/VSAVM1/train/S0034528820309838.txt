 Pyometra is a reproductive disease characterized by the accumulation of purulent or mucopurulent material within the uterine lumen in the presence of an active corpus luteum . As the CL continues secreting progesterone PYO would develop following endometritis . Due to prohibited use of artificial luteolytic hormones in US certified organic dairies conventional therapies consisting of administration of prostaglandin F2 are not applicable . The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two acupuncture procedures on the treatment of persistent CL in cows with PYO . We hypothesized that acupuncture would reduce CL diameter and serum progesterone concentrations leading to regression of PYO . Holstein cows with PYO at an USDA certified organic dairy farm in Northern Colorado were enrolled in a randomized controlled clinical trial and assigned to 1 of 3 treatments control pyometra CP no treatment
