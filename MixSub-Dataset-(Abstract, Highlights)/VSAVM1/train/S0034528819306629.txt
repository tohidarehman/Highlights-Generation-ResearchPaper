 The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of daily feeding of an oral care chew on the composition of canine supragingival plaque microbiota . Twelve beagle dogs were recruited to the randomized cross over study . The dogs were fed one of two dietary regimes both consisting of a commercially available wet and dry diet mix either with or without daily supplementation with an oral care chew . After each 28 day test phase supragingival plaque samples were collected and processed via Illumina sequencing to determine the microbiota composition . A comparative analysis of bacterial species associated with health and periodontal disease identified from prior clinical studies revealed differences between the dietary regimes . Consumption of the daily oral care chew resulted in a significant increase in proportion of 6 health associated taxa but only 3 disease associated taxa compared to no chew . In contrast 8 disease and 1 health associated taxa showed increased proportions for no chew versus the oral care chew .

@highlight We know that some of the bacteria within plaque initiate periodontal disease. Certain bacterial species in plaque are associated with healthy gingiva and others are associated with periodontal disease.
@highlight We have undertaken a study to determine the impact of regular intake of a canine dental chew on the canine plaque microbiota.
@highlight We have demonstrated that feeding this dental chew results in an increased proportion of health associated bacteria and decreased proportion of disease associated bacteria compared to no chew over 28days.
@highlight This is the first study of our knowledge to show that bacteria within canine plaque on the teeth can be influenced by feeding a daily dental chew.
@highlight This demonstrates that bacteria may be employed as biomarkers of dental health rather than solely relying on the quantification of plaque and calculus.
