 The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gamithromycin for the treatment of naturally occurring bacterial swine respiratory disease administered IM . A total of 240 pigs were selected from two sites in Heilongjiang Province of China . The pigs showed severe signs of respiratory disease . Among them 120 pigs were randomly divided into 4 groups of low dose middle dose high dose GAM IM injection and 2.5mg kg tulathromycin IM injection for phase II clinical trial to screen effective therapeutic dose . The other 120 pigs were randomly divided into 2 groups of 6mg kg GAM IM injection and 2.5mg kg TUL IM injection for phase III clinical trial to further confirm the efficacy . Animals were clinically observed daily for 14days after treatment initiation . The predominant pathogens present in pretreatment respiratory tract samples were
