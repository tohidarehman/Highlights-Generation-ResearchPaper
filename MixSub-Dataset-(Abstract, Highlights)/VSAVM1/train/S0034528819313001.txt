 Astroviruses have been identified in the stools of calves with enteritis and in the brain tissues of bovines with encephalitis but their pathogenic role has not been clarified . In this study we report the detection and characterization of bovine and water buffalo AstV strains identified in young bovine and buffalo calves with enteritis in Italy between 2012 and 2015 . By negative staining transmission electron microscopy observation AstV like particles were identified in the stools of the animals and AstV RNA was confirmed molecularly . The sequence at the 3 end of the genome was determined for two bovine and two buffalo AstVs . Sequence and phylogenetic analysis on the partial ORF1b and full length ORF2 revealed a marked genetic diversity although the viruses were distantly related to other AstV identified from ruminants . Gathering sequence information on ruminant AstVs is important to understand the extent of inter species circulation and for the development of reliable specific diagnostic tools .

@highlight Astroviruses in ruminants are neglected enteric viruses.
@highlight Recently neurotropic strains have been identified in ruminants.
@highlight Astrovirus was detected in outbreaks of enteritis in cattle and buffalo in Italy.
@highlight Genome sequencing of the viruses unveiled marked genetic diversity.
@highlight Implementing the diagnostics is pivotal to conceive surveillance studies.
