 Zearalenone is a potent estrogenic toxin in swine contributing to economic losses in herds via reproductive consequences such as pelvic organ prolapse . To better understand the relationship between ZEN consumption and reproductive symptoms an animal feeding study with pubertal gilts was designed . The gilts were exposed to three different treatments solvent only feed for 21days

@highlight The effects of short term moderate zearalenone consumption in pubertal gilts were evaluated.
@highlight The elasticity of the uterosacral ligaments was measured using digital image correlation and biaxial testing.
@highlight Zearalenone consumption did not produce reproductive symptoms or affect elasticity of the uterosacral ligament.
