 To the authors knowledge there have been no studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics of chloramphenicol administered orally to horses at the currently recommended dose of 50 mg kg PO q6 h for multiple days . The published antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoint is 8.0 ug mL it is unknown if this concentration is achievable at the recommended dose rate in horses . The aim of this prospective multi dose pharmacokinetic study was to perform pharmacokinetic analysis of chloramphenicol after multiple doses . The authors hypothesize that the antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoint will not be reached . Seven healthy adult horses were administered 50 mg kg chloramphenicol base tablets PO q6 h for 4 days . Blood was collected via venipuncture daily at 4 and 6 h after administration for the first 15 doses . After the 16th dose an IV catheter was aseptically placed in the right jugular vein and blood was collected at regular intervals for pharmacokinetic analysis .

@highlight There was marked inter individual variation in serum chloramphenicol concentrations after oral dosing in adult horses.
@highlight Average serum concentrations of chloramphenicol were below recommended susceptibility breakpoints for bacteria.
@highlight Time above 4 or 8 g mL the susceptibility breakpoints for bacteria was much less than 50 of the dosing interval.
@highlight When chloramphenicol is administered orally at a dose of 50 mg kg q6 h bacteria with an MIC of 2 g mL should be targeted.
