 As most pathogens invade the bodies through the mucosa it is crucial to develop vaccines that induce mucosal immunity . To this end we generated a safe and effective vaccine candidate that displayed fimbrial protein 987P of enterotoxigenic

@highlight We displayed fimbrial protein 987P of ETEC by using PgsA as an anchoring matrix on the surface of
@highlight CICC 6105.
@highlight The recombinant
@highlight expressing ETEC 987P fimbrial protein elicited an effective protective immune response against ETEC 987P infection.
@highlight The recombinant
@highlight could be a safe and effective mucosal vaccine.
