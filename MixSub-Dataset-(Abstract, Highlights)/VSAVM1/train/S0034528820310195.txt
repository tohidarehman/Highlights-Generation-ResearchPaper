 For the current European legislation the chemical analysis of drug residues is the exclusive accepted method to identify animals illicitly treated with growth promoters . Glucocorticoids and their metabolites are no detectable by LC MS MS methods in biological fluids when the growth promoter administration is discontinued several days prior to the slaughtering . The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect on the expression of genes belonging to the glucocorticoid pathway in three types of skeletal muscle of calves treated with prednisolone or dexamethasone in combination with estradiol . A gene expression change of glucocorticoid receptors
