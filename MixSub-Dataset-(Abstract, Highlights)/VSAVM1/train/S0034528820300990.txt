 Obesity is a highly prevalent condition in horses . Dysfunctional neutrophil activity has been reported in metabolically healthy obese humans but minimal data exist regarding horses . The present study evaluated the effect of obesity on apoptosis phagocytosis and oxidative burst activity of peripheral blood neutrophils from lean and obese non insulin dysregulated horses . Seven lean and five obese horses were enrolled in the study . All animals underwent two metabolic tests before their selection to ensure their metabolic status . A single blood sample was obtained from each horse and a discontinuous density gradient was carried out to isolate neutrophils . Phagocytosis apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production assays were performed for each animal . All statistical analyses were performed with unpaired two tailed

@highlight Blood neutrophil respiratory burst is altered in obese non insulin dysregulated horses.
@highlight Obesity does not affect blood neutrophil lifespan.
@highlight Obesity does not affect blood neutrophil phagocytic capacity.
