 The objective of this study was to determine if the genotype of equine herpesvirus 1 impacted clinical disease and outcome of horses with laboratory confirmed equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy . Medical records from 65 horses diagnosed with EHM from 2011 to 2019 were reviewed for signalment presence and severity of clinical signs and outcome . Horses were further grouped based on the EHV 1 genotype into neuropathic D

@highlight Equine herpesvirus 1 myeloencephalopathy EHM is a multifactorial disease combining viral host and environmental factors.
@highlight EHM has been more commonly associated with the neuropathic D
@highlight  than the non neuropathic N
@highlight  genotype.
@highlight Horses with EHM caused by either D
@highlight or N
@highlight genotype of EHV 1 showed no differences in age sex and outcome.
@highlight Urinary incontinence was the only sign more frequently reported in horses infected with the D
@highlight genotype of EHV 1.
