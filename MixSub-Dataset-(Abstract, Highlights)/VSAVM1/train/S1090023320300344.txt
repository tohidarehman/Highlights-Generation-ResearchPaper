 In young Cavalier King Charles spaniels intermittent mitral regurgitation in a small proportion of heartbeats has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac death due to myxomatous mitral valve disease . It is associated with increased R R interval variability . Little is known about response to physiological factors and whether iMR is a precursor for developing significant MR . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate and short term progression of MR in CKCS with and without iMR . In total 52 CKCS were included . Substudy 1 enrolled six dogs with iMR and 11 dogs without iMR . Substudy 2 enrolled 14 dogs with iMR and 28 dogs without iMR . Substudy 1 prospectively assessed the influence of stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate . Substudy 2 retrospectively evaluated short term progression of iMR .

@highlight Stress tests reduced the presence of intermittent mitral regurgitation iMR .
@highlight iMR was not present at mean heart rates above 150 beats min.
@highlight Heart rate response was similar for dogs with and without iMR.
@highlight iMR did not predict short term progression of mitral regurgitation.
