 In human sport science the acute chronic workload ratio is used to monitor an athletes preparedness for competition and to assess injury risks . The aim of this study was to investigate whether acute and chronic workload calculations for external and internal loads were associated with injury risk in elite eventing horses and to identify workloads performed by horses competing in different competition and at different fitness levels .

@highlight In elite eventing horses spikes in acute workload are strongly correlated to the occurrence of injuries.
@highlight The ACWR HS was associated with injuries not the sprint speed distance this is in contrast to what is often thought by riders and trainers.
@highlight Training regimes in sport horses can be examined in more depth since measures for external and internal workload are now better established.
@highlight Clinical practice in equine sport management should incorporate monitoring the acute chronic workload ratios to reduce injury risks.
@highlight As in human athletes this knowledge may help to reduce sport horse injuries and therefore can contribute to the improvement of equine welfare.
