 This study aimed to investigate the specific pharmacokinetic profile and effects of alfaxalone after intravenous and intramuscular administration to rabbits and evaluate the potential interaction with dexmedetomidine . The study design was a blinded randomized crossover with a washout period of 2weeks . Five New Zealand white rabbits were used . Each animal received single IV and IM injections of alfaxalone at a single dose of 5mg kg and single IV and IM injections of alfaxalone combined with dexmedetomidine administered intramuscularly . Blood samples were collected at predetermined times and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography . The plasma concentration time curves were analysed by non compartmental analysis . Sedation anaesthesia scores were evaluated by a modified numerical rating scale . At pre determined time points heart and respiratory rates were measured . Times to sternal recumbency and standing position during the recovery were recorded . Concentrations of alfaxalone alone were very similar to concentrations when alfaxalone was combined with dexmedetomidine after both routes of administration . Dexmedetomidine enhanced and increase the duration of the sedative effects of alfaxalone . In conclusion

@highlight Intramuscular bioavailabilities of alfaxalone were high.
@highlight Alfaxalone as a sole agent did not increase the heart rate. The inclusion of dexmedetomidine clearly decreased it.
@highlight Addition of dexmedetomidine enhanced and increase the duration of the sedative effects of alfaxalone.
@highlight Alfaxalone alone or combined with dexmedetomidine could achieve moderate or deep sedation in rabbits respectively.
