 A number of studies have demonstrated the clear beneficial impact that vaccinating against Newcastle disease can have on reducing the frequency and severity of ND outbreaks . Here we go one step further and analyse the additional benefits in terms of improved production that result from vaccination .

@highlight An analysis of the impacts of Newcastle disease vaccination and husbandry practices on chicken flock productivity in smallholder farms in Uganda.
@highlight Productivity was measured by offtake measured by the numbers of chickens consumed gifted or sold over one year and eggs consumed and sold per week.
@highlight Adjusting for flock size Newcastle disease vaccination resulted in a 57 increase in offtake and use of poultry housing a 36 increase in offtake.
@highlight After adjusting for the number of hens vaccinating against Newcastle disease resulted in an 80 increase in egg production.
@highlight Use of dewormers and feed supplementation had no significant effect.
