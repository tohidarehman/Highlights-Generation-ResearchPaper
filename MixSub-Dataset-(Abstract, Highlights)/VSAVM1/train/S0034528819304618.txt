 Disease surveillance systems effectiveness relies on participants following prescribed practices . We developed a general method to improve a previous cost effectiveness evaluation of three French screening program protocols for bovine tuberculosis to account for the practices of participants by scenario tree modelling . This method relies on 1 semi directive interviews of participants to identify the variability of practices and potentially influential factors and to understand the sociological context 2 a quantitative survey based on multiple choice questions to quantify various practices and identify significantly influential factors by multivariable regression analyses 3 addition of the scenario tree nodes corresponding to the practices and their influential factors and configuration of the new limbs according to the data of the quantitative survey .
