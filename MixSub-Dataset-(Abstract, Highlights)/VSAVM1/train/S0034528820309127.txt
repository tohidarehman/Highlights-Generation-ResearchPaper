 The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine the impact of a recent trauma on thyroid axis and adrenal activity in dogs and to assess the usefulness of urinary cortisol to creatinine ratio basal serum thyroid stimulating hormone total thyroxine and free thyroxine concentrations in predicting outcome in dogs traumatized by a road traffic accident .

@highlight Within 24h of trauma serum and urinary hormone abnormalities can be detected in dogs.
@highlight Increase of UCCR and lowering of tT4 are correlated with the trauma score.
@highlight Serum TSH and fT4 levels were significantly lower for trauma exposed dogs than nonexposed dogs treated for other conditions.
@highlight Serum tT4 and fT4 levels were significantly lower for trauma nonsurvivors than survivors.
@highlight UCCR is significantly higher in injured dogs and isa putative prognostic factor for mortality.
