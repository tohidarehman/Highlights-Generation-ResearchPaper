 Two component systems are widespread regulatory systems which can help bacteria to control their cellular functions and respond to a diverse range of stimuli . The KdpD KdpE system had been well studied for regulating potassium transport and identified as an adaptive regulator involved in the virulence of some pathogenic bacteria but its role in avian pathogenic

@highlight The first work to study the function of the KdpD KdpE two component system in avian pathogenic
@highlight The first study showing the KdpD KdpE two component system contributed to the expression of some flagella related genes flagella formation and motility in avian pathogenic
@highlight The first study showing the KdpD KdpE two component system influenced the antiserum bactericidal activity of avian pathogenic
