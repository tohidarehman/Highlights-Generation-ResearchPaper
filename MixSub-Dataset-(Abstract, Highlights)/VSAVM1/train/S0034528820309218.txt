 Ticks are obligate hematophagous ectoparasites and important vectors of several pathogens of medical and veterinary significance in addition to economic losses associated with their infestation . The primary method for the current control of tick is the use of synthetic acaricides and many studies have focused on the tick control efficacy associated with the use of synthetic acaricides . However the intensive use of these compounds has environmental and public health implications in addition to the development of resistant tick populations . Over the years studies have demonstrated the great potential of botanicals as an effective alternative in tick control . Most of the reviews on the acaricidal activity of botanicals focused on the effects relating to the development reproduction and mortality rate of ticks . Besides this acaricidal activity botanicals can also affect the morphophysiology of the reproductive organs and the salivary glands that are important for tick procreation and survival . Effects relating to histopathological and cell ultra structural alterations caused by botanical acaricides can be determined through microscopy techniques . Hence the present mini review focuses on studies dealing with morphophysiology changes of the reproductive system and the salivary gland of ticks exposed to botanical acaricides with a view of expanding our knowledge for the future integrative application of botanical acaricides in tick control .

@highlight We summarize the morphophysiological changes of the reproductive and salivary glands in ticks induced by botanical acaricides.
@highlight Deformed chorion and vacuolated cytoplasm was observed in the ovaries subjected to botanical acaricides.
@highlight Cell damage was also observed in the tubular and accessory glands of Gen s organ.
@highlight Botanical acaricides can enhance and accelerate the degeneration process of the salivary glands in ticks.
