 Hen eggs provide valuable nutrients for humans including proteins carbohydrates lipids and vitamins . Recent studies revealed a number of novel egg derived proteins peptides and EDPs may play a crucial role in food industry and medical therapy . First these EDPs were purified from the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysates of egg proteins and were characterized by biochemical assays such as gel electrophoresis HPLC mass spectrometry proteomic and peptideomic analysis

@highlight Recent novel biological functions of egg derived peptides EDPs were summarized.
@highlight Functional EDPs were produced and identified by multiple biological methodologies.
@highlight The first potential of EDPs is to facilitate modern food processing as additives.
@highlight The promising medical values of EDPs were demonstrated comprehensively.
@highlight EDPs may play more crucial roles in food industry as well as medicine development.
