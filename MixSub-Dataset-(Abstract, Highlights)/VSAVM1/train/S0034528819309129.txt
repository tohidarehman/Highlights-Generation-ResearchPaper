 The microbiota that resides in the digestive tract plays pivotal role in maintaining intestinal environmental stability by promoting nutrition digestion and intestinal mucosal immunity . However whether the intestinal microbiota in laying hens affects egg laying performance is not known . In this study 16S rDNA gene sequencing and fecal microbiota transplantation were used to determine the structure of the intestinal microbiota and the effect of the intestinal microbiota on egg production . The results revealed that Firmicutes were dominant in both the H and L groups while Bacteroides Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were significantly enriched in the L group compared to the H group . The laying rates were weakly affected in H hens transplanted with the fecal microbiota from L hens except for temporary fluctuation while the egg laying rates were significantly increased in L hens transplanted with the fecal microbiota from H hens . Therefore we concluded that the population structure of the intestinal microbiota varied between the H and L groups and the intestinal microbiota of high yield laying hens had significant effects on low yield laying hens performance .

@highlight The intestinal microbial compositions of hens with different laying rates were determined using 16S rDNA gene sequencing.
@highlight Differences in the intestinal microbiota of hens with different laying levels were verified by FMT.
@highlight The intestinal flora homeostasis of the high egg laying hens was significantly superior to that of the low egg laying hens.
