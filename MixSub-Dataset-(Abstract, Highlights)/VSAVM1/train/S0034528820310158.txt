 Sixty seven pregnant Angus cows and their subsequent calves were used in a randomized design to evaluate the effect of inorganic Se injection from 80 d of gestation until weaning on cow reproductive parameters BW and BCS evolution milk yield and quality calf growth and calf hematology parameters . The treatments were as follows 1
