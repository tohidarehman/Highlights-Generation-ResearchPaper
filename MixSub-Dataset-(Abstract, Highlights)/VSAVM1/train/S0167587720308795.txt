 Tunisia is an endemic country for dog mediated rabies . An increase in canine rabies cases during the last decade has been suspected . Since no studies have been conducted on rabies spatial distribution the present work was focused on spatiotemporal evolution of rabies in Tunisia during the 20112016 period with a special focus on the reservoir species . Data collected concerned suspected dogs that originate from the whole country . Surveillance indicators such as positive fractions and number of suspected dogs received at the laboratory have been calculated . Spatiotemporal hotspots were then mapped spatial and spatio temporal analysis were carried out using discrete Poisson spatial model and space time permutation models available in SaTScan9 software . The study revealed that an actual increase in canine rabies incidence occurred in Tunisia since 2012 . Spatial and spatio temporal analysis identified clusters centered in the North and in the Center East of the country . Spatio temporal clusters were non overlapping indicating that this spatial distribution is not fixed through time . A large heterogeneity in surveillance indicators such as number of suspected dogs was associated to the distance to the laboratory or to insufficient coordination between governorates .

@highlight Canine rabies cases in Tunisia are spread all over the territory.
@highlight Canine rabies surveillance in Tunisia show a large heterogeneity.
@highlight Multiple spatiotemporal clusters have been identified located in the North and Center East.
@highlight An observable movement of clusters indicates that rabies distribution is constantly evolving over space and time.
