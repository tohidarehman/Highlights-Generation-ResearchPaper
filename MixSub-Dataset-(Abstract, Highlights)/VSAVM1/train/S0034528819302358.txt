 Flavonoids have shown beneficial effects in various disease conditions as reported by various previous studies . Biochanin A is a flavonoid present in various plants in nature . Present investigation was done to assess the vasorelaxant potential of biochanin A on isolated coronary artery of goat and its possible mechanism of action . Vascular reactivity experiments were done on circumflex coronary artery of goats using the tension experiments . Goat coronary arterial rings were relaxed with biochanin A in concentration dependent manner . Endothelium had no effect on biochanin A induced relaxation . Maximum relaxation induced by biochanin A was 116.5412.21 in endothelium intact artery and it was not significantly different with maximal relaxation of endothelium denuded vessel . L NAME did not show any effect on biochanin A induced relaxation . TEA BK

@highlight Biochanin A showed concentration dependent relaxation in the isolated coronary artery of goat.
@highlight Relaxation response induced by the biochanin A was mediated through the voltage gated potassium channels.
@highlight Ca
@highlight 1.2 channels were also involved in the biochanin A induced relaxation in the goat coronary artery.
