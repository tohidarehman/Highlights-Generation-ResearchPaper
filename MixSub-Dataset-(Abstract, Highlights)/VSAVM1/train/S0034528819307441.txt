 Bovine viral diarrhea virus infection causes immune dysfunction . The current study investigated the effect of cytopathic or noncytopathic strains of BVDV on immunomodulation by the levels of total serum immunoglobulin G the IgG1 IgG2 BVDV neutralizing antibodies and total white blood cell count . Twenty BVDV seronegative dairy calves were divided in two groups of ten . The animals were infected with either a cp or ncp virus isolated from the same animal . One group of 10 was infected with ncp TGAN while the other group of 10 was infected with cp TGAC . Calves infected with cp BVDV had a significant decrease in total IgG as well as IgG1 concentration at 7days post infection that recovered by 21 DPI and 35 DPI respectively . There was no effect of ncp BVDV infection on total IgG concentration in the first 7days of infection however IgG1 concentration was significantly reduced and IgG2 concentration was significantly increased at 7 DOI . At 35 DPI ncp TGAN infected calves had significantly higher total IgG IgG1 as well as IgG2 compared to cp TGAC infected calves . Ncp BVDV induced higher BVDV homologous and heterologous neutralizing antibodies compared to the cp BVDV strain . Calves infected with ncp BVDV had significantly reduced WBC counts at 7 DPI that recovered by 14 DPI . Overall these findings indicate that humoral immunosuppression occurs early following BVDV infection with the largest effect on IgG1 levels .

@highlight Bovine viral diarrhea virus BVDV infection causes immune dysfunction.
@highlight Cytopathic cp and non cytopathic ncp BVDV biotypes play a role in dysfunction.
@highlight Both cp and ncp BVDV were found to induce a transient immune suppression.
@highlight Ncp BVDV1b induced a robust
@highlight humoral immune response.
@highlight challenge studies need to be needed to confirm protection.
