 For understanding the factors affecting bovine viral diarrhea virus transmission this study investigated the distribution of BVDV and the epidemiological features of persistently infected cattle in Ibaraki Prefecture of Japan and identified farm level risk factors associated with BVDV infection with a focus on within farm transmission and PI animal detection .

@highlight Farm level bovine viral diarrhea virus BVDV seroprevalence was 58.3 on dairy farms in Ibaraki Prefecture Japan
@highlight Persistently infected PI cattle were identified on 5.8 of dairy farms
@highlight Herd size summer pasturing and BVDV infection on neighboring farm were risk factors for herds being serologically positive
@highlight Herd size summer pasturing and cattle purchases were risk factors for PI animals in a herd
