 This study aimed to assess the safety and reproducibility of cell therapy for its use in clinical practice . We performed immunophenotypic characterization of equine bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells by flow cytometry using CD90 CD19 CD14 CD105 CD45 and HLA DR markers

@highlight Suitable antibodies were identified for the immunophenotyping of equine BMMSCs.
@highlight The set of techniques was effective for determining the quality and characterizing equine BMMSCs.
@highlight Both equine BMMSCs and their conditioned medium inhibited lymphocyte proliferation.
@highlight Cell to cell contact was not necessary for BMMSC inhibitory action.
