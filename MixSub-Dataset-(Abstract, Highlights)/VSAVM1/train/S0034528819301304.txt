 Pediculosis is a parasitic disease that is considered a serious global public health problem . It is caused by the ectoparasite that is popularly known as lice mainly affecting children in early childhood . The most commonly used treatment to combat this parasitosis is the macrocyclic lactone ivermectin . However the use of IVM is contraindicated in children who are younger than 5years old or who weigh 15kg because some types of drugs that are used during certain periods of brain maturation can lead to behavioral disorders . The present study evaluated the effects of IVM treatment during the prepubertal and pubertal period on sexual behavior in adulthood in male rats . Genital grooming preputial separation sexual behavior sexual motivation relative organ weight the gonadosomatic index and histopathology were evaluated . Oral dose of 0.2mg kg of a commercial IVM formulation was administered . IVM affected genital grooming but did not influence preputial separation in prepubertal rats . Prepubertal IVM administration did not impair sexual behavior in adult rats with the exception of the time of residence with female rats in the sexual motivation test . It did not affect relative organ weights with the exception of the relative weight of the full seminal vesicle . It did not alter the gonadosomatic index and no histopathological alterations were observed in different organs . These results indicate that administration of a therapeutic dose of IVM during the prepubertal and pubertal period does not alter parameters of sexual development or sexual behavior in adult male rats .
