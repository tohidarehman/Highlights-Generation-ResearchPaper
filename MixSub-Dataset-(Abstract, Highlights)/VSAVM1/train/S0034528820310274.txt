 Bovine leukemia virus infects more than 40 of the United States cattle population and impacts animal health and production . Control programs aiming to reduce disease prevalence and incidence depend on the ability to detect the BLV provirus anti BLV antibodies and differences in blood lymphocyte counts following infection . These disease parameters also can be indicative of long term disease progression . The objectives of this study were to determine the timing and to describe early fluctuations of BLV detection by qPCR ELISA and lymphocyte counts . Fifteen Holstein steers were experimentally inoculated with 100L of a blood saline inoculum . Three steers served as in pen negative controls and were housed with the experimentally infected steers to observe the potential for contract transmission . Five additional negative controls were housed separately . Steers were followed for 147days post inoculation . Infections were detected in experimentally infected steers by qPCR and ELISA an average of 24 and 36 DPI respectively . Significant differences in lymphocyte counts between experimentally infected and control steers were observed from 30 to 45 DPI . Furthermore a wide variation in peak proviral load and establishment was observed between experimentally infected steers . The results of this study can be used to inform control programs focused on the detection and removal of infectious cattle .

@highlight Wide inter steer variation in proviral load and lymphocyte count was observed.
@highlight Infection was detected by PCR on average 12days before detection by ELISA.
@highlight A significant difference in lymphocytes was observed during early infection period.
@highlight High and low proviral load phenotypes may be established shortly after infection.
@highlight BLV infected steers may test PCR negative following initial infection and detection.
