 The emergence of human alphaherpesvirus strains resistant to commonly used antiviral drugs has prompted the research for alternative biologically active anti herpetic agents . Natural product and synthetic hydroxytropolones have been identified as lead therapeutic agents for a number of infections including HHV 1 and 2 and several veterinary herpesviruses i.e . bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 equine alphaherpesvirus 1 and feline alphaherpesvirus 1 . In the present study we evaluated the activity in vitro of two natural and two synthetic hydroxytropolones against Caprine alphaherpesvirus 1 which is regarded as a useful homologous animal model for the study of HSV 2 infection chiefly for the assessment of antiviral drugs in in vivo studies . AlphaHTs were able to decrease significantly CpHV 1 viral titres up to 4.25 log10 TCID

@highlight AlphaHTs recently proved to have potent activity against human alphaherpesviruses.
@highlight Inhibitory activity of HTs against CpHV 1 was evaluated in vitro.
@highlight AlphaHTs decreased CpHV 1 replication and DNA copies.
@highlight In vivo experiments will be useful to assess efficacy of HTs against CpHV 1.
