 is a site for acupuncture stimulation located in the fossa between the anus and tail base in animals . To evaluate HA as a potential immunization site the immune responses were compared when HA and the conventional site nape were vaccinated in rats . The results showed that injection of a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus vaccine in HA induced significantly higher IgG IgG1 IgG2 splenocyte proliferation and mRNA expression of IL 2 IL 4 and IFN than in the nape . To search for the underlying mechanisms the draining lymph nodes for HA and the nape were investigated . When rats were injected in HA with Indian ink 11 lymph nodes including caudal mesenteric lymph node and bilateral gluteal lymph nodes posterior inguinal lymph nodes lumbar lymph nodes internal iliac lymph nodes and popliteal lymph nodes were visibly stained with the ink and injection of a model antigen ovalbumin in HA resulted in detection of OVA by western blotting while in the same lymph nodes only a pair of lymph nodes were observed when Indian ink or OVA was injected in the nape . IL 2 mRNA expression was detected in all the lymph nodes when PEDV vaccine was injected . Therefore the enhanced immune response elicited by vaccination in HA may be attributed to more lymphocytes activated .

@highlight Houhai acupoint HA is a site traditionally used for acupuncture stimulation.
@highlight Vaccination in HA elicits significantly higher immune responses than the nape.
@highlight Eleven draining lymph nodes DLNs are found for HA while only two for the nape.
@highlight Lymphocytes in all DLNs are activated after injection of a vaccine in HA or nape.
@highlight Higher immune responses by vaccination in HA are due to more triggered lymph nodes.
