 Measuring core body temperature is used as part of the diagnostic process in assessing the health of animals . Typically in calves this is carried out using a rectal thermometer which can be time consuming stressful to the calf and is invasive by nature . A non invasive technique that is gaining recognition is thermal imaging . This study investigated the use of thermal imaging as a technique to assess core body temperature in pre weaned artificially reared calves . A total of 125 male and female calves had rectal temperatures measured daily from day 7 until day 40 of life and at the same time had a thermal image taken of the area around the medial canthus of the eye . A weak correlation

@highlight Weak correlation between thermal image temperature and rectal temperature
@highlight Adding air temperature wind speed and volume of milk replacer consumed to the predictive model improved the correlation
@highlight Based on results thermal imaging is not considered a reliable method for predicting core body temperature of calves
