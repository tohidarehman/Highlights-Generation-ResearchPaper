 The cardiac conduction system is a network structure that allows the initiation and fast propagation of electrical impulses that trigger the electrical depolarization of the myocardial tissue . The purpose of this work is to study the histological and morphometric characteristics of the different components of the sinus and atrioventricular nodes in humans and pigs and their relationship with supraventricular arrhythmias .

@highlight The cardiac nodes are composed mainly of connective tissue and their shape is oblong.
@highlight In the cardiac nodes the P cells are round and the T cells are elongated.
@highlight The sinus node in humans presents T cells organized linearly in the periphery.
@highlight In the atrioventricular node in humans P cells are smaller than myocardiocytes.
@highlight In the atrioventricular node in pigs P cells are twice the size of myocardiocytes.
