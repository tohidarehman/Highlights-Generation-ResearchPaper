 Pododermatitis is a disorder with a complex etiology because potentially determined by various factors such as posture nutrition and genetics . In the case of presence of pododermal lesions it is often noticed that rabbits go to eat at the bowl less frequently but an evident weight loss is not always perceptible . In fact similarly to poultry overweight animals seem to be prone to the onset of pododermatitis . An experiment was carried out to test the effect of different types of bedding material on the prevalence of pododermatitis in 30 fattening Separator rabbits . Once a week the four experimental runs were assessed for contamination as well as for lesion scoring of the footpad . In addition the water and ammonia binding behaviour of bedding was tested . The most favourable values as to dry matter NH

@highlight Footpad lesions are an issue for health and welfare of both farmed and pet rabbits.
@highlight The quality of litter acts as a co factor on the onset of lesions.
@highlight Body weight and physical characteristic of the bedding material show an interplay in the development of pododermatitis.
@highlight High DM content and low NH
@highlight are desired physico chemical parameters to evaluate the fitness of bedding material.
@highlight In descending order cotton wood shavings coarse bark bulk and straw displayed best to least favourable characteristics.
