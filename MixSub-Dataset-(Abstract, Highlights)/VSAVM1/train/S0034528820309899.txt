 In vitro studies have demonstrated that platelet lysate can serve as an alternative to platelet rich plasma to sustain chondrocyte proliferation and production of extracellular matrix components in chondrocytes . The present study aimed to evaluate the direct effects of PL on equine articular chondrocytes in vitro in order to provide a rationale for in vivo use of PL .

@highlight Platelet lysate PL released by alginate beads can sustain in vitro proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes
@highlight In cell based therapies Platelet lysate PL could be used for the in vitro chondrocyte expansion
@highlight PL 5 to 10 maintains the gene expression pattern of markers typical of mature articular chondrocytes
@highlight PL could be an alternative to xenogeneic serum by strongly promoting the proliferative potential of horse chondrocytes
