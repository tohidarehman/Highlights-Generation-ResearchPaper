 Fissures on the occlusal surface of equine cheek teeth are commonly encountered during oral examination . Generally their presence is considered abnormal but their aetiopathogenesis and clinical impact on pulp disease is still undetermined . The aims of this research were to study the extent of occlusal cheek teeth fissures using high resolution X ray computed tomography imaging and their histological characteristics . Twenty seven teeth were scanned using CT imaging to analyse fissure extent . Histological examination of a subset of teeth

@highlight Equine occlusal cheek teeth fissures were commonly observed.
@highlight CT demonstrated potential fissure depth and their close relationship with the pulp.
@highlight Fissures hold the potential for bacterial invasion of pulp canals.
