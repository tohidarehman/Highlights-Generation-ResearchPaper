 In order to explore the function of vitamin C and VC Na in the relief of heat stress injury in chicken cardiomyocytes 150 30 day old specific pathogen free chickens were randomly divided into a control group a VC group and a VC Na group . After 7days of adaptation feeding the chickens were subjected to heat stress at 402C and 60 70 humidity for 0 1 3 5 and 10h respectively and the sera and heart tissues of the chickens were collected immediately at the corresponding heat stress time points . The effects of VC and VC Na supplementation on the relief of chicken myocardial cell injury following heat stress was studied by detecting the levels of LDH CK CK MB and total antioxidant capacity in the sera and through histopathological analysis and the expression of CRYAB Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the myocardial cells . The results showed that supplementing with 50g mL VC or VC Na significantly reduced the levels of LDH and CK MB in serum as well as heat stress induced granular and vacuolar degeneration myocardial fiber breakage and cell necrosis indicating effective resistance to heat stress damage . Additionally the levels of T AOC in serum were increased in the VC and VC Na groups suggesting enhancing of antioxidant capacity . Furthermore the expression of CRYAB were induced at 0 3 5 and 10h

@highlight Adding VC Na induces the expression of CRYAB and Hsp70 in chicken myocardial cells under normal and heat stress conditions.
@highlight Supplementing with VC induces the expression of CRYAB under both normal and heat stress conditions.
@highlight VC and VC Na also enhances the antioxidant ability of chicken myocardium cells to relieve heat stress injury.
