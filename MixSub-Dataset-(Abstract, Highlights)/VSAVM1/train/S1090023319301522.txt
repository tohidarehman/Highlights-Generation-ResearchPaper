 Mitochondrial oxidation is essential in fat metabolism and can be monitored with blood acylcarnitine profiling as partly degraded fatty acids accumulate as their carnitine esters . To guarantee continuous energy supply during long distance exercise endurance horses oxidise considerable amounts of fat in the mitochondrion . In endurance races over 80km glycogen depletion is evident in equine slow twitch high oxidative muscle fibres and as a consequence horses participating in endurance races over 80km rely almost entirely on oxidation of fatty acids . This study investigated mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in endurance horses exposed to long distance exercise . Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry analysis of serum acylcarnitine profiles from 10 Arab horses was performed before and after a 160km endurance race . Results were analysed statistically using ANOVA .

@highlight Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation following strenuous exercise has not previously been studied in either animals or humans.
@highlight The availability of carnitine in long distance endurance horses might limit their performance.
@highlight These findings might serve as a model for studying fatty acid oxidation under strenuous conditions.
