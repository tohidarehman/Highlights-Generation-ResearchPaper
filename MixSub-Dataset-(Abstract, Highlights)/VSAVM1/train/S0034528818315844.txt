 Chondrocyte dedifferentiation is a key limitation in therapies based on autologous chondrocyte implantation for cartilage repair . Articular chondrocytes obtained from joints of different aged horses were cultured in monolayer for several passages . Cumulative Populations Doublings Levels and gene expression of relevant chondrocyte phenotypic markers were analysed during culturing . Overall data confirmed that during proliferation

@highlight Proliferative phase after P3 seems to be critical for maintenance loss of differentiation potential 
@highlight Chondrocytes from elderly horses go through an early dedifferentiation and a reduction of their proliferative capacity 
@highlight Related trend of Col6 fibromodulin Sox6 and TGF 1 to changes of Runx2 for monitoring of the dedifferentiation process.
@highlight Chondrocytes from adult donors showed a more stable expression of mature cartilage markers.
