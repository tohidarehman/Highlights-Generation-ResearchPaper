 Cutaneous papilloma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are frequent epidermal tumours in dogs . In this regard the study of the deregulated activity of signalling molecules during the epidermal tumourigenesis process could be the basis for the development of novel molecular mechanism based antitumour treatments for CP and CSCC canine patients . Recent evidence suggests that the development and progression of CP and CSCC involve the dysregulated activation of the Hippo signalling pathway effector YAP . Thus in the present study we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression pattern of YAP in sections of tissue microarrays constructed from canine samples of normal epidermis CP preneoplastic epidermis and CSCC . In samples of CP preneoplastic epidermis and CSCC YAP expression was significantly increased relative to normal epidermis . This emerging evidence suggests that the dysregulated activity of the Hippo signalling pathway effector YAP represents a frequent event during canine epidermal tumourigenesis pointing to this protein as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CP and CSCC in dogs .

@highlight The Hippo signalling pathway effector YAP has a low expression in the normal canine epidermis.
@highlight YAP expression is significantly increased during epidermal tumourigenesis in dogs.
@highlight YAP represent a potential therapeutic target in cutaneous papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas in dogs.
