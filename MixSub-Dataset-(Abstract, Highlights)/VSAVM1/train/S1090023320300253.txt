 The major control methods for Aujeszky s Disease involve SHV1 gE gene deleted vaccines and ELISA for detection of specific gE antibodies in infected animals distinguishing infected animals from vaccinated animals . This work aimed to develop a DIVA ELISA recombinant gE for AD diagnosis using recombinant gE fused to thioredoxin protein . The analytical sensitivity and specificity were assessed with World Organisation for Animal Health AD serum and sera from specific pathogen free vaccinated SPF and AD vaccinated SPF animals . The OIE serum reacted up to the recommended limit of detection and the other sera presented negative results . The cut off point diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity were determined by receiver operating curve analysis . This cut off value corresponded to a diagnostic sensitivity of 97.60 and diagnostic specificity of 96.42 . Furthermore two other cut off points were chosen to discuss the ELISAgErec as a screening test in AD endemic and free areas .

@highlight Aujeszky s Disease AD virus gE protein fused to thioredoxin was produced in
@highlight Thioredoxin recombinant gE Trx gErec fusion protein was used as coating antigen in the development of an ELISA.
@highlight The ELISA could distinguish infected animals from vaccinated animals DIVA .
@highlight ELISAgErec showed high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
@highlight ELISAgErec may also be used as a screening test in endemic and free areas of AD.
