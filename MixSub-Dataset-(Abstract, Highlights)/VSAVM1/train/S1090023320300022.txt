 Bovine respiratory disease complex is the most common disease requiring the use of antimicrobials in industrial calf production worldwide . Pathogenic bacteria

@highlight The bovine respiratory disease BRD complex is widespread in cattle production requiring high use of antimicrobials.
@highlight Quantifying bacterial and viral pathogens by qPCR provides good predictive value for disease diagnosis.
@highlight A commercially available multiplex qPCR Pneumo4 quantified relevant pathogens over a 5 log range.
@highlight The assay had good agreement with currently used methods for detection of relevant pathogens.
