 We studied the inflammation effect on somatostatin receptors subtypes 2 and 5 expression in myometrium and somatostatin influence alone or with sstr2 and sstr5 antagonists on the contractility of gilt inflamed uterus . On day 3 of the estrous cycle either

@highlight Uterine inflammation raises protein content of somatostatin receptor type 2 in myometrium
@highlight Somatostatin increases amplitude and drops frequency of the inflamed uterus
@highlight In the inflamed uterus somatostatin raises the amplitude acting by its receptor type 2
@highlight Somatostatin drops amplitude of the inflamed uterus by its receptor type 5
