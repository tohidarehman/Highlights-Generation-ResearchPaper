 The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two non antibiotic treatment options for digital dermatitis on an organic certified dairy farm . A randomized clinical trial was conducted using 70 multiparous Holstein cows with an early DD lesion at a USDA certified organic dairy farm in Northern Colorado USA . Cows were enrolled in the study based on the presence of early DD lesions and randomly assigned to one of three treatments topical application of copper sulfate and iodine topical application of honey and iodine and control subject to no treatment . Cows were evaluated at enrolment and on days 3 12 28 and 120 post treatment for pain and lesion size and received a locomotion and a lesion score . Cure was defined as the transition from active to non active stages .

@highlight Digital dermatitis is a painful condition that can result in lameness and decreased performance.
@highlight Two non antibiotic formulations resulted in earlier transition to M0 lesions than no treatment.
@highlight A copper sulphate and iodine combination was most effective in reducing lesion size pain and lameness.
@highlight A honey and iodine combination reduced lesion size but effects were transient.
