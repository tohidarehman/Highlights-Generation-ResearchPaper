 Minimizing sympathetic stimulation under anesthesia prevents activation of the neuroendocrine stress response . The minimum alveolar concentration blunting adrenergic responses in 50 of the population when exposed to a noxious stimulus is defined as MAC BAR . The purpose of this study was to determine the MAC BAR of sevoflurane MAC BAR

@highlight The MAC BAR of sevoflurane MAC BAR
@highlight  was investigated in sheep.
@highlight The sparing effects of intravenous ketamine on sevoflurane were evaluated.
@highlight MAC BAR
@highlight values of ketamine and placebo were 2.73 and 2.77 .
@highlight Ketamine plasma concentrations of 1.54g mL were maintained though the study.
@highlight Ketamine did not decrease the MAC BAR
@highlight in sheep.
