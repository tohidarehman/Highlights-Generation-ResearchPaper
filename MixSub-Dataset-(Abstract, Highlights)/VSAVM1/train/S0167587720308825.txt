 Canine osteoarthritis is a common painful condition that is typically managed in a general practice setting . Osteoarthritis may have significant negative impacts on the welfare of both dogs and their owners . Anticipated early clinical signs of canine osteoarthritis and the preferred route to its diagnosis are well described by veterinary subject experts in published literature . However little is known about changes owners first recognise in a dog ultimately diagnosed with osteoarthritis how they make decisions about when to present that dog to a general practitioner or whether the described diagnostic pathways are followed by general practitioners . The aim of this research was to investigate how dog owners and veterinary surgeons describe identifying and diagnosing canine osteoarthritis .
