 Bovine mastitis is the most important disease affecting dairy herds worldwide causing direct impacts on farms profitability and food safety issues . The prevention and treatment of this pathology is especially done through antimicrobials but the increasing antimicrobial resistance of pathogens to this disease may affect the efficiency of conventional drugs . Besides antimicrobials residues in milk and the environment are a potential threat to human health . Thereby the use of plant extracts and essential oils may become promising alternatives for the control of bovine mastitis . Antimicrobial properties present in several plants are well described and plant extracts and essential oils are often considered safe to animals humans and environment . This review summarizes the current problems encountered in the conventional treatment of mastitis the possibilities of the use of plant extracts and essential oils as alternative agents for the control of these pathogens and the limitations found in the use of these plant derivatives . Finally the perspectives to the use of plant extracts and essential oils for the treatment of bovine mastitis are presented .
