 Myxomatous mitral valve disease is the single most important acquired cardiovascular disease of the dog . Much is known about the cellular changes and the contribution of activated myofibroblasts to the valve extra cellular matrix remodelling characteristic of the disease . However little is known on how aVIC survival might contribute to disease pathogenesis . This study examined the temporal and spatial distribution of aVICs in MMVD valves the expression of a range of apoptosis related genes in cultured VICs from both normal and diseased valves and the differential effects of doxorubicin treatment as a trigger of apoptosis on expression of the same genes . Activated myofibroblasts were identified in normal valves at the valve base only and then became more numerous and apparent along the valve length as the disease progressed with evidence of cell survival at the valve base . There were no significant differences in basal gene expression comparing qVICs and aVICs for

@highlight Activated myofibroblasts are persistent in myxomatous mitral valve disease MMVD .
@highlight Apoptosis gene expression are comparable in normal and diseased mitral valve VICs.
@highlight Doxorubicin induces differential expression of apoptotic genes in normal and diseased VICs.
@highlight expression is significantly different in diseased VICs treated with doxorubicin.
@highlight Activated myofibroblast persistence in MMVD may be due to resistance to apoptosis.
