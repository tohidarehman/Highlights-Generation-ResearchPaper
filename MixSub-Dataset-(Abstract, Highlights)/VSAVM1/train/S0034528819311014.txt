 Senecavirus A also known as Seneca Valley virus is an emerging infectious pathogen which have been detected in swine herds from the Brazil USA Colombia Thailand Canada and some provinces in China suggesting an increasing geographic distribution of this novel virus . Here we isolated and characterized a SVV designated SVA CH GX 01 2018 thought to be responsible for typical vesicular lesions on the snouts and hooves of finishing pigs from a swine herds in Guangxi province China in August 2018 . Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment indicated that this SVA CH GX 01 2018 strain was closely related to the strains isolated in 2017 in Guangdong province a neighboring province of Guangxi South China with 98.6 identity at the genome nucleotide level . Our findings characterized a novel SVV infection in pigs from South China and emphasize the importance of surveillance reinforcing biosecurity measures and developing vaccines to prevent the spread of this viral pathogen .

@highlight We isolated and characterized a SVV isolate responsible for typical vesicular lesions on the hooves of pigs.
@highlight The SVV isolate shares 93.2 to 98.7 nucleotide similarities with other SVA strains.
@highlight The SVV isolate in Guangxi province in 2018 was closely related to the strains isolated in 2017 in Guangdong province a neighboring province of Guangxi South China.
