 Small ruminant lentiviruses are widespread amongst domesticated sheep and goats worldwide . Infection of wild ruminants in close contact with affected domesticated small ruminants has been proposed as an actor in SRLV epidemiology but studies are limited . The aim of this study was to estimate the apparent and estimated prevalence of exposure to SRLV infection in wild ruminants from Poland . Samples originating from 198 free living cervids comprising 142 European red deer and 56 roe deer were serologically tested using a multi epitope recombinant antigen ELISA representing subtypes A1 A13 B1 and B2 of SRLV and a commercial ELISA test . The estimated prevalence of SRLV infection was estimated using the Bayesian approach with models that adjusted for the misclassification of animals because of a small population and lack of sampling method the imperfect performance of the ELISAs and because sera of different species were tested . The calculated estimated prevalence ranged from 5.3 to 24.6 for the ELISA with multi epitope antigens while estimated prevalence using the commercial ELISA was 2.5 . These results may suggest the existence of a new SRLV reservoir in Poland and highlight the importance of surveilling and controlling SRLV infection in domestic and wild ruminants sharing pasture areas .

@highlight This study provides the first data on the prevalence of SRLV in wild cervids in Poland.
@highlight Our results strongly indicate that the prevalence of SRLV in red deer and roe deer may be very high.
@highlight Wild cervids may play an important role in the epidemiology of SRLV infections and circulation of these viruses between susceptible animals.
@highlight Use of ELISA with recombinant antigens based on different SRLV subtypes improved detection of infection as compared to the commercially ELISA.
