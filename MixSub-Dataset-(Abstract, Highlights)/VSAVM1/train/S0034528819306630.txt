 Melanoma progression is associated with the epithelial mesenchymal transition when tumor cells reduce E cadherin and increase N cadherin expression resulting in an escape from the microenvironment via loss of cellular adhesion and gain of motility . Transcription factor proteins Snail and ZEB trigger EMT by repression of epithelial markers and activation of mesenchymal properties . This study evaluated E cadherin N cadherin Snail ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression by IHC and investigated their relationship with morphological characteristics in cutaneous and oral canine melanoma . Results from melanoma cases demonstrated E cadherin expression in 45 of oral and 58 of cutaneous tumors while N cadherin expression was observed in 95 of oral and 92 of cutaneous melanoma . Cytoplasmic and nuclear N cadherin expression was positively correlated with ZEB1 expression while the cell membrane N cadherin expression was positively correlated with ZEB2 . In addition an increase in nuclear N cadherin expression was associated with reduced Snail expression in cutaneous melanoma and an increase in Snail expression in oral melanoma indicating that the correlation between N cadherin and Snail expression is coincident with tumor location . Our data suggest that ZEB family protein is associated with N cadherin translocation from cell membrane to the cytoplasm and nuclei and may act as important transcription factors of EMT regulation in canine melanoma .
