 Zinc plays an important role in the regulation of insulin like growth factor I . IGF system in turn has a key role in the development and functions of the reproductive organs . This research was performed to investigate the effects of different sources of zinc on IGF I gene expression and testicular development in pre pubertal male Japanese quail . A total of 512 unsexed day old Japanese quail chicks were randomly divided into 16 groups and kept for 35days . The control group diet was not supplemented with zinc whereas the diets of three groups were supplemented with 25mgkg

@highlight Zn Met or ZnON may accelerate the quail sexual development and the onset of puberty.
@highlight Zn Met or ZnON can improve the IGF family gene expression in the testis of male quail.
@highlight Maturation of male quail was more efficiently accelerated by Zn Met supplementation.
