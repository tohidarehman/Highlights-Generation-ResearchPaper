 Mineralized enamel and dentin provide protection to the dental pulp which is vital tissue rich with cells vasculature and nerves in the inner tooth . Dental caries left untreated threaten exposure of the dental pulp providing facile access for bacteria to cause severe infection both in the pulp and systemically . Dental materials which stimulate the formation of a protective dentin bridge after insult are necessary to seal the pulp chamber in an effort to maintain natural dentition and prevent pulpal infection . Dental materials to date including calcium hydroxide paste mineral trioxide aggregate and glass ionomer resin are used with mixed results . Herein we exploited the cell cell communicative properties of exosomes extracellular vesicles derived from both mineralizing primary human dental pulp stem cells and an immortalized murine odontoblast cell line to catalyze the formation of a reactionary dentin bridge by recruiting endogenous stem cells of the dental pulp through an easy to handle delivery vehicle which allows for their therapeutic controlled delivery at the pulp interface . Exosomes derived from both hDPSCs and MDPCs upregulated odontogenic gene expression and increased mineralization

@highlight Exosomes from dental pulp stem cells and odontoblast cells upregulate odontogenic genes.
@highlight Triblock copolymer is able to deliver exosomes with tunable dose and duration.
@highlight Sustained exosome release induces dental pulp stem cell migration and dentin regeneration.
@highlight Exosome loaded dental pulp capping materials facilitate dentin bridge formation and protect pulp tissue.
