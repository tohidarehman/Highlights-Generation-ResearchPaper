 Intravitreal delivery of antibody based therapeutics has revolutionized the treatment of intraocular vascular diseases involving the retina and choroid . Unfortunately limited durability requires frequent retreatment placing an enormous burden on patients . We sought to solve this problem with a novel approach that uses an anchoring molecule characterized by two key molecular properties non covalent binding to an antibody based therapeutic and retention in the vitreous cavity . As an initial proof of principle we chose an anchoring molecule composed of agarose microbeads functionalized with an Fc binding domain . Bevacizumab was chosen as the antibody based therapeutic .

@highlight Sustained delivery of bevacizumab in the eye.
@highlight Utilizes an anchoring molecule capable of intravitreally retaining therapeutics.
@highlight Relies on a novel non covalent method to bind retain and slowly release.
@highlight Demonstration of
@highlight retention for over 90days.
@highlight Adaptable to a wide range of antibody based therapeutics.
