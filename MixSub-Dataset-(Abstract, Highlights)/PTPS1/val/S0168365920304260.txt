 Exosomes are natural nanovesicles excreted by many cells for intercellular communication and for transfer of materials including proteins nucleic acids and even synthetic therapeutic agents . Surface modification of exosomes imparts additional functionality to the exosomes to enable site specific drug delivery and in vivo imaging and tracking and is an emerging area in drug delivery research . The present review focuses upon these modifications on the exosomal surface the chemistry involved and their impact on targeted drug delivery for the treatment of brain breast lung liver colon tumors and heart diseases and for understanding their in vivo fate including their uptake mechanisms pharmacokinetics and biodistribution . The specific exosomal membrane proteins such as tetraspanins lactadherin lysosome associated membrane protein 2b and glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol involved in functionalization of exosome surface have also been discussed along with different strategies of surface modification like genetic engineering covalent modification and non covalent modification along with optical and radioactive isotope labelling techniques of exosomes for imaging purpose .

@highlight Exosomes functionalized with targeting labelling moieties impart multifunctionality.
@highlight Exosome proteins like tetraspanins Lamp 2b lactadherins allow surface modification.
@highlight Covalent and non covalent strategies are used for exosome surface functionalization.
@highlight Accurate isolation purification storage of exosomes enhances their clinical utility.
