 The biological fate of polymeric micelles following oral administration was investigated in this study to better understand the contribution of transport of integral PMs to oral absorption . To track integral PMs near infrared fluorophores with aggregation caused quenching properties were utilized to label PMs comprised of methoxy poly poly copolymers and methoxy poly distearoyl phosphoethanolamine . The particle size of PMs prepared from mPEG

@highlight The biological fate of polymeric micelles was investigated following oral administration.
@highlight Labeling by ACQ fluorophores enables monitoring of integral PMs.
@highlight PMs are able to penetrate the enteric epithelia and reach the blood stream and the liver.
@highlight Lymphatic transport contributes to only 12 oral absorption of integral PMs.
@highlight The overall amount of oral absorption of integral PMs is limited.
