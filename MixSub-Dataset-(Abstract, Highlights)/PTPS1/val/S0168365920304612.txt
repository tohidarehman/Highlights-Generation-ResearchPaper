 Antibody has become the most rapidly expanding class of pharmaceuticals for treating a wide variety of human diseases including cancers . Especially with the fast development of cancer immunotherapy antibody drugs have become the most promising therapeutic for curing cancers . Immune mediated cell killing by antibodies including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity antibody dependent cell phagocytosis and complement dependent cytotoxicity as well as regulation of T cell function through immune checkpoint blockade . Due to the absence of Fc fragment antibody fragments including single chain variable fragments and single domain antibodies are mainly applied in chimeric antigen receptors T cell therapy for redirecting T cells to tumors and T cell activation by immune checkpoint blockade . In this review the cancer immunity is first discussed . Then the principal mechanisms of antibody based immunotherapy will be reviewed . Next the antibody and antibody fragments applied for cancer immunotherapy will be summarized . Bispecific and multispecific antibodies and a combination of cancer immunotherapy with other tumor treatments will also be mentioned . Finally an outlook and perspective of antibody based cancer immunotherapy will be given . This review would provide a comprehensive guidance for the researchers who are interested in and intended to involve in the antibodies or antibody fragments based tumor immunity .
