 Development of injectable nanoparticles for delivery of active anticancer compounds often requires complicated schemes that involve tedious synthetic protocols and nanoformulations . In particular clinical translation of synergistic nanoparticles that can facilitate multimodal therapies remains a considerable challenge . Herein we describe a self assembling small molecule nanosystem with unique properties including near infrared light responsive drug activation size transformability combinatorial synergy and substantially reduced toxicity . Ligation of anticancer cabazitaxel drugs via a reactive oxygen species activatable thioketal linkage generates a dimeric TKdC prodrug and subsequent coassembly with a photosensitizer chlorin e6 forms colloidal stable nanoassemblies . Upon NIR laser irradiation psTKdC NAs are transformed into smaller size particles and facilitate production of pharmacologically active CTX . Importantly reactive oxygen species yielded by coassembled Ce6 can synergize with chemotherapy to achieve potent combinatorial effects . In a preclinical orthotopic model of an aggressive human melanoma patient derived xenograft we show that administration of psTKdC NAs followed by laser irradiation produced durable tumor regression with the tumors being completely eradicated in three of six PDXs . Furthermore low systemic toxicity of this smart photo activatable nanotherapy was observed in animals . The new self deliverable combinatorial system addresses essential requirements for high efficacy safety and translational capacity and deserves further investigation .
