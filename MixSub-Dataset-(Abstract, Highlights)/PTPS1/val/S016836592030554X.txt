 For the past two decades biomimetic high density lipoproteins have been used for various drug delivery applications . The b HDL mimic the endogenous HDL and therefore possess many attractive features for drug delivery including high biocompatibility biodegradability and ability to transport and deliver their cargo to specific cells and tissues that are recognized by HDL . The b HDL designs reported in the literature often differ in size shape composition and type of incorporated cargo . However there exists only limited insight into how the b HDL design dictates their biodistribution . To fill this gap we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature search of biodistribution studies using various designs of apolipoprotein A I based b HDL . We carefully screened 679 papers for b HDL biodistribution studies in mice and ended up with 24 relevant biodistribution profiles that we compared according to b HDL design . We show similarities between b HDL biodistribution studies irrespectively of the b HDL design whereas the biodistribution of the b HDL components differ significantly . The b HDL lipids primarily accumulate in liver while the b HDL scaffold primarily accumulates in the kidney . Furthermore both b HDL lipids and scaffold accumulate well in the tumor tissue in tumor bearing mice . Finally we present essential considerations and strategies for b HDL labeling and discuss how the b HDL biodistribution can be tuned through particle design and administration route . Our meta analysis and discussions provide a detailed overview of the fate of b HDL in mice that is highly relevant when applying b HDL for drug delivery or
