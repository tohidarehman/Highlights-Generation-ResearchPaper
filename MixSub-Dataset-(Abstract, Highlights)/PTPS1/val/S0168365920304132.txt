 Invasion and metastasis of tumor cells is one of the major obstacles in cancer therapy . The process of tumor metastasis and diffusion is coordinated by multiple pathways associated with chemokine signals and migration microenvironment . In our previous work chemokine CXC receptor 4 antagonists showed significant anti metastatic effects by blocking the CXCR4 stromal cell derived factor 1 axis in pancreatic cancer and breast cancer . Here we proposed to achieve migration chain treatment for metastatic tumors by introducing a cell adhesion molecules CD44 inhibitor to deprive of cell migration capability on the basis of CXCR4 antagonism . Dextrin modified 1.8k PEI with CM end was prepared to deliver therapeutic miR 34a for efficient anti metastasis by downregulating adhesion protein CD44 and targeting the CXCR4 SDF 1 axis . Additionally reduced expression of the anti apoptotic protein Bcl2 caused by miR 34a could enhance the anti tumor efficacy of DPC miR 34a nanoplex administration . Compared with inhibition of the CXCR4 SDF 1 axis or CD44 expression the multidimensional therapy exhibited considerable suppression of cancer cell invasion as assessed by an
