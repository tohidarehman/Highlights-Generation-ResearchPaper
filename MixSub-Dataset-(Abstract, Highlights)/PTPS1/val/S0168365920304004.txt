 Inspired by cell membrane structures synthetic polymer vesicles caused great expectations for the preparation of biomedicine for decades . However in contrast to bio membranes which consist of inhomogeneous features conventional synthetic polymer vesicles usually consist of a homogeneous membrane which is purely made out of hydrophobic components . This significantly limited the versatility of synthetic polymer vesicle membranes . Fortunately polymer vesicles with inhomogeneous membranes were recently developed to address this limitation . These new inhomogeneous membrane features introduced secondary functions to the vesicle membrane . Indeed the membrane of polymer vesicles no longer only serves as a simple barrier that separates the interior from the exterior environment . Introduced membrane features can act as a versatile platform for tailorable nanoparticle functionalities which allow functions such as biomacromolecule transportation diabetes treatment and cancer theranostics . This review highlights recent advances made with polymer vesicles with inhomogeneous membrane structures . More specifically design principles biomedical applications and the future perspectives of such vesicles are summarized .
