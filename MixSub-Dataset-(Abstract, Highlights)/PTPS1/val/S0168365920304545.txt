 The integration of multimodal functions into one nanoplatform holds great promise for enhancing anticancer drug action and mitigating adverse effects . Herein we prepared hyaluronic acid functionalized regenerated silk fibroin based nanoparticles loading with photosensitizer and doxorubicin . The resultant HNDNPs had a desirable diameter of 161.0nm and a negative zeta potential of 30.5mV . Interestingly they showed excellent responses when triggered with various stimuli . Cell experiments revealed that HNDNPs could be specifically internalized by A549 cells and efficiently released the payloads into the cytoplasm . Moreover NIR770 was preferentially retained in mitochondria due to its lipophilic and cationic properties which exhibited highly efficient photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy upon near infrared irradiation . Meanwhile DOX molecules were mainly accumulated in the nucleus . Intravenous injection of HNDNPs into mice followed by NIR irradiation provided excellent multimodal imaging almost eliminated the entire tumor and greatly prolonged mice survival time with no side effects . Our study demonstrates that this HNDNP which integrates the functions of tumor targeting on demand drug release multimodal imaging mitochondrial phototherapy and chemotherapy can be exploited as a promising nanococktail for imaging guided synergistic treatment of cancer .

@highlight Hyaluronic acid functionalized nanoparticles NPs loading with photosensitizer and doxorubicin were produced.
@highlight The resultant HNDNPs showed obvious responses to various stimuli acidity reactive oxygen species glutathione hyaluronidase and hyperthermia .
@highlight The released NIR770 molecules from HNDNPs preferentially accumulated in mitochondria resulting in the enhanced phototherapeutic effects.
@highlight HNDNPs showed excellent triple modal imaging NIRI PTI and PAI for imaging guided cancer treatment.
@highlight The synergistic therapeutic effects of HNDNPs were achieved by the combined application of triple modal therapeutic strategies PTT PDT and chemotherapy .
