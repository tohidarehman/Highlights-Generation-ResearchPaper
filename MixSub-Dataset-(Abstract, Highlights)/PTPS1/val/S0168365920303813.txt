 Rheumatoid arthritis is a common clinical inflammatory disease of the autoimmune system manifested by persistent synovitis cartilage damage and even deformities . Despite significant progress in the clinical treatment of RA long term administration of anti rheumatic drugs can cause a series of problems including infections gastrointestinal reactions and abnormal liver and kidney functions . The emergence of RNA interference drugs has brought new hope for the treatment of RA . Designing a reasonable vector for RNAi drugs will greatly expand the application prospects of RNAi . Nanoparticles as a promising drug carrier provide reliable support for RNAi drugs . The review summarizes the pathogenesis of RA as a possible target for small interference RNA design . At the same time the review also analyzes the nanoparticles used in siRNA carriers in recent years laying the foundation and prospect for the next step in the development of intelligent nanocarriers .

@highlight siRNA therapy has been widely investigated as a potential therapeutic approach
@highlight The effectiveness of siRNA in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has been confirmed in animal model studies
@highlight siRNA will be affected by microenvironments in vivo which will greatly reduce the efficiency of RNA interference
@highlight Nanoparticle delivery system would enclose siRNA in carriers for protection and transport to the targeted cells
