 Transcutaneous immunization has the advantages of avoiding the liver first pass effect good compliance and convenient use compared with the traditional oral or injection vaccination . However the stratum corneum of the skin is the main obstacle that limits the entry of antigen molecules into the epidermis for activating dendritic cells . In the present study the hyaluronic acid and galactosylated chitosan modified ethosome was prepared through layer by layer self assembly method . Eth HA GC has good stability and can be effectively phagocytosed by the bone marrow derived DCs in vitro . The ovalbumin loaded Eth HA GC

@highlight A novel hyaluronic acid HA and galactosylated chitosan GC modified ethosome Eth HA GC was prepared through layer by layer self assembly.
@highlight Eth HA GC showed a good performance on targeting and inducing the maturation of dendritic cells DCs .
@highlight The green electrospun silk fibroin SF nanofibrous mats loaded with Eth HA GC Eth HA GC SF can effectively deliver ovalbumin OVA through the skin.
@highlight  SF effectively elicited both cellular and humoral immune responses to OVA through transdermal administration in the mouse model.
@highlight  SF evidently inhibited the growth of EG7 tumor in the mouse model through transdermal administration.
