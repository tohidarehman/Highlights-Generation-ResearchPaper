 The application of bacteria and bacteria derived membrane vesicles has promising potential to make a great impact on the development of controllable targeted drug delivery for combatting cancer . Comparing to most other traditional drug delivery systems bacteria and their MVs have unique capabilities as drug carriers for cancer treatment . They can overcome physical barriers to target and accumulate in tumor tissues and initiate antitumor immune responses . Furtherly they are able to be modified both genetically and chemically to produce and transport anticancer agents into tumor tissues with improved safety and efficacy of cancer treatment but decreased cytotoxic effects to normal cells . In this review we present some examples of tumor targeting bacteria and bacteria derived MVs for the delivery of anticancer drugs including chemo therapeutic radio therapeutic photothermal therapeutic and immuno therapeutic agents . We also discuss the advantages as well as the limitations of these tumor targeting bacteria and their MVs used as platforms for controlled delivery of anticancer therapeutic agents and further highlight their great potential on clinical translation .
