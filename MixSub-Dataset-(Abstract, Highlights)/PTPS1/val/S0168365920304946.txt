 Focused ultrasound mediated intranasal delivery is a recently proposed technique that bypasses the blood brain barrier to achieve noninvasive and localized brain drug delivery . The goal of this study was to characterize FUSIN drug delivery outcome in mice with regard to its dependency on several critical experimental factors including the time interval between IN administration and FUS sonication T

@highlight FUS mediated intranasal delivery FUSIN is a promising brain drug delivery method
@highlight FUSIN enhanced the delivery of bovine serum albumin BSA at the mouse brainstem
@highlight The accumulation of BSA was low in all major organs except stomach and intestines
@highlight FUSIN delivery outcome was affected by key experimental parameters
