 Nanomedicines for antitumour therapy have been widely studied in recent decades but only a few have been used in clinical applications . One of the most important reasons is the poor tumour permeability of the nanomedicines . In this three part review intravascular transvascular and extravascular transport were introduced one by one according to their roles in the overall process of nanomedicine transport into tumours . Transportation obstacles such as elevated interstitial fluid pressure abnormal blood vessels dense tumour extracellular matrix and binding site barriers were each discussed in the context of the respective transport processes . Furthermore homologous resolution strategies were summarized on the basis of each transportation obstacle such as the normalization of blood vessels regulation of the tumour microenvironment and application of transformable nanoparticles . At the end of this review we propose holistic concrete and innovative views for better tumour penetration of nanomedicines .

@highlight The inefficiency of clinical nanomedicines for tumour therapy is related to their low level penetration.
@highlight Tumour penetration of nanoparticles involves intravascular transvascular and extravascular transport processes.
@highlight Tumour penetration of nanoparticles is limited by various barriers during the three transport processes.
@highlight Corresponding strategies to enhance tumour penetration of nanoparticles are discussed.
