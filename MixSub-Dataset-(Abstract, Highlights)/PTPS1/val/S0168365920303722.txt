 As the main cause of tumoral fatality metastasis remains to be one of the most urgent difficulties researcher struggled to overcome . During the development and progression of metastasis the establishment of pre metastatic niche is crucial in preparing fertile microenvironment for disseminated tumor cells settlement and colonization in distant metastatic target sites . The key participators including the primary tumor derived factors bone marrow derived cells stromal cells of both the host and the potential metastatic sites regulate the temporal progress of potential metastasis . Firstly pioneers are sent from primary tumor recruiting immunosuppressive cells then circulating tumor cells settled and colonized and finally micrometastases develop . Here we summarize the therapeutic strategies presented in recent years targeting different stages of the pre metastatic niche formation and discuss their chances and challenges in clinical translation providing promising approaches for metastasis prevention and therapeutic interventions .

@highlight General alterationsin the secondary organs need to bepreparedin advance by remote control from primary tumor.
@highlight ThePMNformation can be separated into three major temporal phases following sequential order.
@highlight Recent developed therapeutic strategies targeting the pre metastatic niche formation faced both opportunities and challenges.
