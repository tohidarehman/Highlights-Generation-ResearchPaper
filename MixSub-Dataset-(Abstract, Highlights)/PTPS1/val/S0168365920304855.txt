 There are a lot of geometrical and morphological changes that happen in the human eye with age . Primary open angle glaucoma which is caused by the increase in intraocular pressure inside the anterior chamber of the eye is also associated with the physiological aging of the eye . Therefore it is crucial to understand the effects of aging on drug delivery in the human eye when applied topically . Consequently a numerical model of topical drug delivery for an aging human eye has been developed using commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics in the current study . Three different age groups have been considered and the changes in geometrical and tissue properties of different domains of the eye with age have been included in the numerical model . The effect of aging on heat transfer aqueous humor flow intraocular pressure and drug concentration in different domains and orientations of the eye have been investigated . Additionally an attempt has been made to predict the best class of anti glaucomatic treatment
