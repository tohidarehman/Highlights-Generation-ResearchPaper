 Many high affinity peptide antagonists of MDM2 and MDMX have been reported as activators of the tumor suppressor protein p53 with therapeutic potential . Unfortunately peptide activators of p53 generally suffer poor proteolytic stability and low membrane permeability posing a major pharmacological challenge to anticancer peptide drug development . We previously obtained several potent dodecameric peptide antagonists of MDM2 and MDMX termed PMIs one of which TSFAEYWALLSP bound to MDM2 and MDMX at respective affinities of 0.49 and 2.4nM . Here we report the development of gold nanoparticles as a membrane traversing delivery vehicle to carry PMI for anticancer therapy . Np PMI was substantially more active
