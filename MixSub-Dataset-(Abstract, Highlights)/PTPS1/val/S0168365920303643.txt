 Cancer therapies aim to kill tumor cells directly or engage the immune system to fight malignancy . Checkpoint inhibitors oncolytic viruses cell based immunotherapies cytokines and adjuvants have been applied to prompt the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells . However systemic exposure of cancer therapies can induce unwanted adverse events . Intratumoral administration of potent therapies utilizes small amounts of drugs in an effort to minimize systemic exposure and off target toxicities . Here we discuss the properties of the tumor microenvironment and transport considerations for intratumoral drug delivery . Specifically we consider various tumor tissue factors and physicochemical factors that can affect tumor retention after intratumoral injection . We also review approved and clinical stage intratumoral therapies and consider how the molecular and biophysical properties of these therapies influences intratumoral transport . Finally we offer a critical review and highlight several emerging approaches to promote tumor retention and limit systemic exposure of potent intratumoral therapies .

@highlight Intratumoral IT therapies reduce adverse events compared to systemic therapies.
@highlight Tumor microenvironment TME properties must be considered in IT delivery.
@highlight Molecular size charge and formulation of drugs dictate transport of IT therapeutics.
@highlight Modifying drug physicochemical properties or formulation may improve local IT effects.
