 Lanthanum can reduce absorption of phosphate by forming lanthanum phosphate complexes after oral administration of lanthanum carbonate tablets in patients . Based on the pH responsive interaction of phosphate and lanthanum ions the chitosan coated siRNA loaded lanthanum phosphate nanoparticles were prepared for improving cancer treatment in which polysaccharide chitosan was used as the outer shell to control the excessive growth of lanthanum phosphate complexes and enable intestinal mucoadhesion . The CS LaP siEGFR NPs exhibited significant biological activities in human colorectal cancer HT 29 cells by the synergistic effects of siEGFRs and lanthanum ions such as downregulation of EGFR and upregulation of miR 34a . Furthermore significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in both transgenic C57BL 6 Apc
