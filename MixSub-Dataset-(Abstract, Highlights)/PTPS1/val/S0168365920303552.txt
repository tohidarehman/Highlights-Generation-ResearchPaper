 Adjuvants that contain pathogen associated molecular patterns can enhance vaccination efficacy by binding to pattern recognition receptors thereby stimulating immune responses . Particularly effective may be the combination of multiple PAMPs that activate different PRRs which occurs with natural pathogens . Here we hypothesized the enhanced effects would occur in two adjuvants that stimulate different PRRs CpG oligodeoxynucleotide which is Toll like receptor 9 agonist and 5 triphosphate short double stranded RNA which activates retinoic acid inducible gene I . The model antigen ovalbumin was loaded and adjuvants were surface adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles by electrostatic interaction with an average size of 120nm and a negative surface charge for targeting lymph nodes . These nanoparticles were efficiently internalized by antigen presenting cells in the lymph nodes and the resulting APC activation and antigen cross presentation generated strong humoral immunity and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and IFN secretion . NP 3pRNA CpG significantly suppressed B16 OVA tumor growth and prolonged survival of tumor bearing mice in therapeutic and prophylactic models illustrating the enhanced effects of CpG ODN and 3pRNA . Our study highlights the potential of combining multiple adjuvants for effective vaccine design .

@highlight Nano sized aluminum hydroxide combined two adjuvants NP 3pRNA CpG for activating different pattern recognition receptors.
@highlight NP 3pRNA CpG accumulated in the lymph nodes and could be effectively ingested by DCs and macrophages.
@highlight NP 3pRNA CpG generated enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses.
