 In photodynamic therapy the inherent physicochemical properties of a photosensitizer critically affect its biodistribution and therapeutic outcome as well as side effect . Here we developed a PS polymer conjugate displaying isothermal hydrophilic to hydrophobic phase transition in response to tumorous acidic pH . The polymer backbone was poly

@highlight pH responsive isothermal phase transition potentiates photosensitizer delivery.
@highlight The polymer could target mild acidic extracellular pH in a tumor.
@highlight Hydrophilicity prevented unfavorable interaction with serum components.
@highlight Hydrophobicity facilitated cellular uptake and augmented therapeutic effect.
