 To harness the intrinsic transport properties of albumin yet improve the therapeutic index of current in situ albumin binding prodrugs we developed albumin drug conjugates with a controlled loading that achieved better antitumor efficacy . Here model drug monomethyl auristatin E was conjugated ex vivo to Cys34 of albumin via a cathepsin B sensitive dipeptide linker to ensure that all drug would be bound specifically to albumin . The resulting albumin drug conjugate with a drug to albumin ratio of 1 retained the native secondary structure of albumin compared to conjugate with a higher DAR of 3 . ALDC1 exhibited improved drug release and cytotoxicity compared to ALDC3 in vitro . Slower plasma clearance and increased drug exposure over time of ALDC1 were observed compared to ALDC3 and MMAE prodrug . In single dose studies with MIA PaCa2 xenografts cohorts treated with ALDC1 had the highest amount of MMAE drug in tumor tissues compared to other treatment arms . After multiple dosing ALDC1 significantly delayed the tumor growth compared to control treatment arms MMAE MMAE linker conjugate and ALDC3 . When dosed with the maximum tolerated dose of ALDC1 there was complete eradication of 83.33 of the tumors in the treatment group . Ex vivo conjugated ALDC1 also significantly inhibited tumor growth in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model that better recapitulates the phenotype and clinical features of human pancreatic cancers . In summary site specific loading of drug to albumin at 1 1 ratio allowed the conjugate to better maintain the native structure of albumin and its intrinsic properties . By conjugating the drug to albumin prior to administration minimized premature cleavage and instability of the drug in plasma and enabled higher drug accumulation in tumors compared to in situ albumin binding prodrugs . This strategy to control drug loading ex vivo ensures complete drug binding to the albumin carrier and achieves excellent antitumor efficacy and it has the potential to greatly improve the outcomes of anticancer therapy .
