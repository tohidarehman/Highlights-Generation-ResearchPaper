 Single reactive oxygen species mediated therapy photodynamic therapy or chemodynamic therapy is severely hindered in hypoxic solid tumor . Herein to address the urgent challenge a hypoxia activated ROS burst liposome has been fabricated to achieve synergistic PDT CDT that is initiated by the structural dissociation of poly liposome in hypoxic tumor microenvironment . The therapeutic enhancement of our ROS blasting treatment is simultaneously regulated by external light initiated PDT and endogenous iron oxide nanoclusters triggered CDT which is synergistically boosted and amplified by localized mild hyperthermia under 808 660nm coirradiation . More importantly in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that electron affinic poly product from hypoxia responsive transition of poly polymers could efficiently enhance hypoxic cell apoptosis and induce solid tumor ablation . Thus this work offers a potential hypoxia activated ROS burst PDT CDT strategy with a superior antitumor efficacy highlighting a promising clinical application .
