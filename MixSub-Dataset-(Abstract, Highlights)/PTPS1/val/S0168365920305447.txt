 Extracellular vesicles a heterogeneous population of membrane vesicles are secreted by almost all living cells and contain different proteins lipids and nucleic acid depending on their sources . Recently numerous reports indicated EVs could interact with diverse cells in tumor microenvironment and influence both physiological and pathological conditions . Given that EVs regulate tumor immune microenvironment EVs based strategies are explored for anti tumor immunotherapy . In this review about nine kinds of EVs derived from diverse cells are indicated . The biological functions in tumor immunity strategies for anti tumor immunotherapy and further clinical trials of these EVs will be introduced in detail .

@highlight Extracellular vesicles derived from diverse types of cells possess significant immunomodulation properties.
@highlight Mechanisms of extracellular vesicles regulating tumor immune microenvironment contribute to excellent anti tumor efficacy.
@highlight Engineering modification of extracellular vesicles is an excellent approach for enhanced therapeutic effects.
