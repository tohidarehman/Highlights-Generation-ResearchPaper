 Psoriasis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by thickening of the epidermis accompanied by lesional erythema scaling and induration as a result of abnormal proliferation of keratinocytes . During the development of psoriasis levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species within psoriatic lesions are elevated activating a pro inflammatory signaling cascade . Here we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and mode of action of bilirubin nanoparticles based on the potent endogenous antioxidant bilirubin in a preclinical psoriasis model . We found that topical treatment of psoriatic lesions with BRNPs effectively attenuated upregulation of intracellular ROS levels within keratinocytes and ameliorated the symptoms of psoriasis . A subsequent mechanistic study showed that preventing oxidative stress in activated keratinocytes suppressed the secretion of inflammatory mediators and recruitment of immune cells . Subsequent expression of the antigen presenting cell maturation markers class II major histocompatibility complex cluster of differentiation 80 and CD86 was significantly decreased resulting in a reduction in the differentiation of nave CD4
