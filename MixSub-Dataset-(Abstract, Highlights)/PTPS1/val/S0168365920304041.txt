 Posterior capsule opacification still remains the most frequent long term complication after cataract surgery while endophthalmitis is rare but severe and should be prevented at all cost . Intraocular lenses with different designs and materials have been studied to reduce PCO . For the prevention of endophthalmitis intracameral injection followed or not by topical treatment with antibiotics and anti inflammatories are usually prescribed . The objective of this work was to investigate the use of IOLs as controlled release platforms of two drugs the antibiotic moxifloxacin and the anti inflammatory ketorolac that could advantageously substitute the usual treatment . Two types of IOLs were chosen hydrophobic and hydrophilic . Hydrophobic IOLs have shown better results in the prevention of PCO because they adhere better to the posterior capsular bag while hydrophilic IOLs are advised in the case of patients with uveitis glaucoma or diabetes . The IOLs were loaded with MXF KTL and sterilized by high hydrostatic pressure . Both IOLs reduced the tendency for adhesion of LECs .

@highlight Hydrophilic and coated hydrophobic IOLs may be loaded simultaneously with MXF and KTL.
@highlight Drug loaded IOLs release both drugs in a sustained way.
@highlight Drug loaded IOLs decrease the adherence of HLECs and are biocompatible.
@highlight Drug loaded IOLs lead to therapeutic levels of MXF and KTL in the aqueous humor.
@highlight Drug loaded IOLs have better performance than eye drops in
@highlight tests.
