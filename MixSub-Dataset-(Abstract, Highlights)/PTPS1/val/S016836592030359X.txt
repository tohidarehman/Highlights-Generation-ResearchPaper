 To improve therapeutic efficacy of nanocarrier drug delivery systems it is essential to improve their uptake and penetration in tumour tissue enhance cellular uptake and ensure efficient drug release at the tumour site . Here we introduce a tumour targeting drug delivery system based on the ultrasound mediated delivery of enzyme sensitive liposomes . These enzyme sensitive liposomes are coated with cleavable poly which will be cleaved by two members of the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase family . Cleavage of the PEG coat can increase cellular uptake and will destabilize the liposomal membrane which can result in accelerated drug release . The main aim of the work was to study the effect of focused ultrasound and microbubbles on the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of the MMP sensitive liposome . The performance of the MMP sensitive liposome was compared to a non MMP sensitive version and Doxil like liposomes .

@highlight The observed penetration depth was independent of the acoustic pressure applied.
@highlight FUS combined with MMP sensitive liposomes resulted in reduced tumour growth.
@highlight The MMP sensitive liposome performed better than its non MMP sensitive version.
@highlight The Doxil like and MMP sensitive liposome showed enhanced therapeutic efficacy.
