 Hypoxia is a hallmark of many malignant solid tumors . The inadequate oxygen concentration in the hypoxic regions of a solid tumor impedes the efficiency of photodynamic therapy because the generation of reactive oxygen species during the PDT process is directly dependent on the available oxygen . To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PDT we have developed a novel catalytic nanoplatform by co encapsulating hemin as a catalase mimetic nanozyme and chlorin e6 as a photosensitizer into Pluronic coated nanographene oxide through simple hydrophobic interaction and stacking . The nanosystem showed high cellular uptake in the breast cancer cells but did not show any cytotoxicity in the dark condition . nGO hemin Ce6 showed efficient O
