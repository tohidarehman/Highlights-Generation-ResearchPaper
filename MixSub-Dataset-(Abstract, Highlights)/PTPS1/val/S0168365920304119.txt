 The potential of microporous zeolites FAU and BEA and mesoporous MCM 41 for prolonged release of atenolol in drug delivery systems was investigated both experimentally using drug release studies and theoretically using classical molecular dynamics simulations .

@highlight Zeolites have the potential for use in prolonged release drug delivery systems.
@highlight Zero order release of the drug atenolol is achieved from zeolite FAU.
@highlight Zeolite topology and aluminium ratio changes may allow tuning of drug release rate.
@highlight Molecular Dynamics has the potential to screen for useful drug zeolite combinations.
