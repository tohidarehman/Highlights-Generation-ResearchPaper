 Polymeric microneedles have been leveraged as a novel transdermal drug delivery platform for effective drug permeation which were widely used in the treatment of various diseases . However issues including limited loading capacity of hydrophobic drugs uncontrollable drug release rates and monotonic therapeutic strategy hamper the further application of polymeric MNs . As a recent emerging research topic drawing inspiration from the ways that nanomedicine integrated with MNs have opened new avenues for disease therapy . In this review we examined the recent studies employing nanoparticles encapsulated polymeric MNs
