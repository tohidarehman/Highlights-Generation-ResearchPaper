 Many drug molecules that are currently in the market suffer from short half life poor absorption low specificity rapid degradation and resistance development . The design and development of lipophilic prodrugs can provide numerous benefits to overcome these challenges . Fatty acids which are lipophilic biomolecules constituted of essential components of the living cells carry out many necessary functions required for the development of efficient prodrugs . Chemical conjugation of FAs to drug molecules may change their pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics

@highlight Fatty acid is a promising platform in the development of various prodrugs.
@highlight Fatty acid based prodrugs can improve biological properties of parent drugs.
@highlight Ester and amide bonds are the most commonly used bonds to form fatty acid drug conjugates.
@highlight Fatty acid based prodrugs can generate nano DDSs with higher loading capacity.
