 Extracellular vesicles are cell derived lipid bilayer enclosed nanovesicles . EVs are emerging as keys for identifying molecular mechanisms by mediating intercellular communication . EVs allow the exchange of various components with neighboring and distant cells through the extracellular environment thereby involving in various biological processes in both physiological and pathological conditions such as wound healing immune response and tumorigenesis . EVs are also growing rapidly as cargo carrier for their natural delivery properties . Development of bioinspired delivery nanoplatforms based on exosomes like mimetics also showed potentials to overcome limitations of synthetic nanoparticles . EVs offer a window to multicomponent diagnosis and a tool for design therapeutics . However for successful clinical translation of EVs the understanding of
