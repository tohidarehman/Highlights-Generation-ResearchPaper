 For type 2 diabetic patients short acting glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist is often prescribed with frequent needled injections . Long acting GLP 1 RA for less frequent injections do not mimic physiologic secretion of GLP 1 . Therefore an implantable pump is proposed in this work which can deliver a short acting GLP 1 RA exenatide without needles and batteries . The implanted pump can infuse an accurate amount of exenatide bolus only when a noninvasive magnetic force is applied from outside the body . The pump includes a safety feature of patterned magnets for actuation to prevent accidental infusion possibly caused by a general household magnet . The reservoir for exenatide is made of a flexible biomaterial and thus a negative pressure build up in the reservoir can be prevented even after multiple actuations and almost all drug consumption . This allows a reproducible drug dose for a longer period after implantation hence less frequent replenishment procedures . The pump is also equipped with an intermediate container with two distinct check valves and thus the reservoir of exenatide can be further separated and better prevented from infiltration of the bodily fluid surrounding the implanted pump . When tested in Goto Kakizaki rats the pump demonstrates the efficacy of exenatide similar to conventional subcutaneous injections . Therefore the pump can be promising for patient friendly optimal delivery of short acting GLP 1 RA that better follows the physiologic secretion profile of GLP 1 .

@highlight An implantable magnetic pump can deliver an accurate dose of exenatide.
@highlight The pump works noninvasively by a magnet with a specific polarity pattern.
@highlight A reproducible dose can be obtained until almost all drug consumption in the pump.
@highlight Exenatide can be replenished after pump implantation hence semi permanent use.
@highlight The pump shows in vivo efficacy of exenatide similar to conventional injections.
