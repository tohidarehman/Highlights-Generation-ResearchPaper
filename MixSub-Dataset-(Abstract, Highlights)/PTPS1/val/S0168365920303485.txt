 The occurrence of an implant associated infection with the formation of a persisting bacterial biofilm remains a major risk following orthopedic biomaterial implantation . Yet progress in the fabrication of tunable and durable implant coatings with sufficient bactericidal activity to prevent IAI has been limited . Here an electrospun composite coating was optimized for the combinatorial and sustained delivery of antibiotics . Antibiotics laden poly and poly 1q nanofibers were electrospun onto lattice structured titanium implants . In order to achieve tunable and independent delivery of vancomycin and rifampicin we investigated the influence of the specific drug polymer interaction and the nanofiber coating composition on the drug release profile and durability of the polymer Ti interface . We found that a bi layered nanofiber structure produced by electrospinning of an inner layer of and an outer layer of yielded the optimal combinatorial drug release profile . This resulted in markedly enhanced bactericidal activity against planktonic and adherent

@highlight Bi layered electrospun nanofibers applied onto titanium implants to obtain a sustained release profile.
@highlight Co delivery of Rifampicin and Vancomycin demonstrated a combinatorial bactericidal activity.
@highlight The nanofiber filled lattice strategy resulted in a durable coating after surgical implantation.
@highlight Prevention of early and delayed implant infection was achieved with tuning the nanofibers and antibiotics parameters.
