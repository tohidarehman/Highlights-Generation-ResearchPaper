 Nucleic acid based pattern recognition receptor agonists are effective adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents . Rather than single applications ligand combinations could synergistically potentiate immune responses by elevating cytokine and chemokine production via triggering multiple signaling pathways . However short half lives of such labile ligands due to nuclease attack and limited cellular uptake due to their structure significantly hamper their in vivo performances . More importantly simultaneous delivery and activity presentation of protein antigen and nucleic acid ligands critically limit the clinical development of these constructs . In this work we approached this problem by co encapsulating a model antigen ovalbumin along with TLR9 and STING ligands within liposomes a well established drug delivery system that enables payload stability and enhanced cellular activity upon internalization . Moreover by loading dual ligands we postulated to achieve heightened Th 1 immune response that would yield pronounced protective vaccine efficacy . We show that pH sensitive liposomes co encapsulating CpG ODN and cGAMP induced synergistic innate immune response by elevating type I and type II interferon levels . Most importantly this vaccine formulation led to 70 regression of established melanoma tumor . pH sensitive liposomal vaccine administration elevated IgG2c IgG1 antibody ratio indicative of augmented OVA specific Th1 biased immunity . Importantly while the frequency of tumor specific IFN producing CD8
