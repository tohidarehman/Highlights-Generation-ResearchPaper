 An ideal cancer vaccine should contain both strongly immunogenic cancer specific antigen and potent adjuvant for stimulating robust cellular immunity which are pivotal for clearance of cancer cells . However most of commercially available adjuvants such as aluminum phosphate gel can not stimulate robust cellular immune response . In the current study we reformed microscale aluminum phosphate gel adjuvant into nanoscale and fabricated CpG loaded and B16F10 tumor cell membrane coated aluminum phosphate nanoparticles . The resultant nano vaccines showed a size of around 60nm and a negative surface charge of 40mV . Tumor cell membrane not only served as tumor antigens but also effectively improved the colloidal dispersion of aluminum phosphate nanoparticles . Subcutaneously injected APMC were efficiently drained to mouse lymph nodes significantly increased co uptake of tumor antigen and CpG by lymph node resident antigen presenting cells promoted maturation of these cells and enhanced lysosomal antigen escape . After immunizing mice they triggered robust cellular immunity including potent IFN

@highlight Microscale aluminum phosphate adjuvant was reformed to nanoscale and loaded with B16F10 tumor cell membrane and CpG APMC .
@highlight APMC carrying comprehensive tumor antigens showed enhanced immunogenicity dispersion and mobility.
@highlight APMC targeted to lymph nodes and co delivered tumor cell membrane and CpG to lymph node resident DCs and macrophages.
@highlight APMC compensated the shortcomings of aluminum phosphate gel and elicited potent cellular immunity against tumor.
