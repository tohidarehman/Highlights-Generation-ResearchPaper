 Primary tumor metastasis remains to be a tough obstacle for clinical breast cancer treatment . Since evidences have shown that mitochondria play a crucial role in tumor metastasis we designed a mitochondrial targeted drug delivery system based on

@highlight A mitochondrial targeted HPMA copolymer P D R8MTS was designed for anti metastasis.
@highlight P D R8MTS delivered DOX to mitochondria
@highlight MTS mediated active targeting.
@highlight R8 introduction remarkably increased cellular uptake and lysosome escape of P D R8MTS.
@highlight P D R8MTS exhibited superior tumor growth suppression by destroying mitochondria.
@highlight P D R8MTS effectively inhibited metastasis
@highlight down regulation of MMP2 VEGF and TGF .
