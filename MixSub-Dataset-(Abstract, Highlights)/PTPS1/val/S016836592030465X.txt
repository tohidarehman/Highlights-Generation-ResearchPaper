 In this work we sought to incorporate coenzyme Q10 loaded nanoemulsions into a food system and to understand the impact of food digestion on the

@highlight OSA modified starch based edible nanoemulsions 200 nm have shown good colloidal stability in the gastrointestinal tract.
@highlight Incorporating these nanoemulsions into a high protein beverage has changed their fate during gastrointestinal digestion.
@highlight Compared with nanoemulsions the beverage has further promoted the bioavailability of bioactive loading coenzyme Q10 .
