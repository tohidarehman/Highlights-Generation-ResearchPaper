 Development of multifacted phototheranostics with bright fluorescence and absorbance in the second near infrared window is very appealing for precise cancer diagnosis and treatment but still challenging nowadays . Herein we synthesize a hydrophobic annularly fused azaBODIPY molecule with sharp NIR absorbance peaked at 878nm and bright NIR II fluorescence . With Pluronic F127 as the surfactant and hydrophobic paclitaxel as the spacer such HBP molecule would self assemble to form surfactant stripped HBP PTX micelles with absorption peak red shifted to 1012nm and intrinsic NIR II fluorescence negligibly disturbed . We found that such HBP PTX micelles can be utilized as a bimodal NIR II nano probe to enable real time tracking of lymph nodes and tumors under an NIR II fluorescence imaging system as well as clear visualization of tumor microvasculatures under an NIR II photoacoustic imaging system . Furthermore together with 1064nm laser exposure such HBP PTX micelles would synergistically suppress the growth of tumors grown on the mice upon tumor accumulation . This work highlights the concise preparation of a type of all in one NIR II phototheranostics from the newly synthesized HBP molecules thereby enables NIR II fluorescence photoacoustic bimodal imaging guided synergistic cancer treatment via the NIR II laser boosted photothermal therapy and chemotherapy .
