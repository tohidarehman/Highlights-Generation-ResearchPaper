 The technology of directing nanoparticles to specific locations in the body continues to be an area of great interest in a myriad of research fields . In the present study we have developed nanoparticles and a method that allows the nanoparticles to move to specific sites by simultaneously utilizing the homing ability and magnetism of stem cells . Polymeric clustered SPIO nanoparticles are

@highlight PCS do not impede MCS differentiation properties and have low toxicity.
@highlight PCS nanoparticles are transported to lysosomes via early late endosomes in MSC.
@highlight Nanoparticle labeled MSCs with supermagnetic properties may exhibit improved homing.
