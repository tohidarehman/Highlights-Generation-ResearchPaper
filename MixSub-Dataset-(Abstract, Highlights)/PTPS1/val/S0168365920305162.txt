 Bio inspired adhesive hydrogels have been applied to cell and drug delivery systems to address various tissue defects and disorders . However adhesive hydrogels functionalized with phenolic moieties often lack osteoconductive capacity and mechanical properties for bone regeneration . In this study we utilized the versatile chemical interactions of phenolic moieties to overcome such limitations in bone tissue engineering efforts . Highly osteoconductive hybrid hydrogel patches were fabricated by incorporating inorganic minerals hydroxyapatite or whitlockite into pyrogallol conjugated hyaluronic acid . The hybrid HA PG patches exhibited improved mechanical strength and reinforced structural physical properties owing to additional intermolecular complexation between oxidized PG moieties and ions released from inorganic particles . The sustained release of bone morphogenetic protein 2 from hybrid patches was prolonged by combination of the inherent nucleophilic affinity of oxidized PG and electrostatic interactions between inorganic particles and BMP 2 . With increased osteoconductivity hybrid patches with HAP or WKT enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of human stem cells while also promoting new bone formation in a critical sized calvarial defect . Our study demonstrates a translational potential of phenolic adhesive hydrogels engineered with inorganic minerals for orthopedic applications .
