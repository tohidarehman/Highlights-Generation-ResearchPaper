 Carbon nanotubes have attracted significant attention as promising nanocarriers in the field of drug delivery due to their properties such as ultrahigh length to diameter ratio and excellent cellular uptake . The unique conjugated structure of CNTs suits their surface for stacking interactions with many drugs and therapeutic molecules with aromatic rings including anthracyclines . Doxorubicin as an anthracycline anticancer drug can be easily adsorbed onto the surface of CNTs
