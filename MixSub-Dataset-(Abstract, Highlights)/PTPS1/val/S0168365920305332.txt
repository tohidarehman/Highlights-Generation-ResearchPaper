 At present several drug molecules have been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . However the utilization of these compounds through the oral and parenteral route is limited due to low bioavailability rapid metabolism poor absorption first pass effect and serious adverse effects . A transdermal delivery system is an appealing option in this scenario as it possesses the proficiency to overcome drawbacks associated with the oral and parenteral route . With the innovation of several enhancement strategies many therapeutic agents have been administered transdermally proposing an exceptional approach to treat RA . The present article provides an insight into the etiology and pathophysiology of RA . The challenges of the transdermal route and the strategies to improve those problems are described . The current advances in increasing the transdermal efficiency of the therapeutics against RA are discussed . Limitations and advantages regarding the state of the art transdermal delivery system and future outlook are also summarized .

@highlight Currently numerous compounds have been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
@highlight However the utilization of these compounds through the oral and parenteral route exhibits several limitations.
@highlight Transdermal route is an appealing option that not only improves the drug permeation but also enhances patient compliance.
@highlight To accelerate the translation from the clinic to market the safety concerns needs to be evaluated in the very early stage.
