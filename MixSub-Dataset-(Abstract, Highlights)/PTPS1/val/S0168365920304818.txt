 Liposome supported peritoneal dialysis with transmembrane pH gradient liposomes was previously shown to enhance ammonia removal in cirrhotic rats and holds promise for the treatment of hyperammonemic crises associated disorders . The main objective of this work was to conduct the preclinical evaluation of LSPD in terms of pharmacokinetics ammonia uptake and toxicology to seek regulatory approval for a first in human study . The formulation containing citric acid loaded liposomes was administered intraperitoneally at two different doses once daily for ten days to healthy minipigs . It was also tested in a domestic pig model of hyperammonemia . The pharmacokinetics of citric acid and 1 2 dipalmitoyl

@highlight LSPD was tested in minipigs and domestic pigs.
@highlight The pharmacokinetic profiles of citric acid DPPC and cholesterol were favorable.
@highlight Citric acid DPPC and cholesterol did not accumulate upon repeated administration.
@highlight LSPD concentrated more ammonia in the peritoneal space than control PD fluids.
@highlight LSPD was found to be safe.
