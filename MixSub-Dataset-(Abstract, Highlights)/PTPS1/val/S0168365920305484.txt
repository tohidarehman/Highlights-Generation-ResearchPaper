 Refractory acute myeloid leukemia remains a challenging hematological malignancy to treat due to the development of drug resistance severe complications and relapse in chemotherapies . Free drugs combination has demonstrated enhanced therapeutic efficacy in AML while it requires complicated administration regimens and brings added toxicity . To tackle this complex disease in this work two clinically applied therapeutics doxorubicin and homoharringtonine were assembled into one polymeric micelle to form a co delivery system to facilitate a novel and simple administration regimen . The DHM was systematically investigated in the drug resistant AML cell line HL60 A as well as in the AML1 ETO

@highlight Doxorubicin and homoharringtonine were co assembled to form a facile multidrug micelle DHM .
@highlight Compared with free drugs DHM significantly prolonged the survival of refractory leukemia mouse.
@highlight DHM successfully eradicated the residual leukemia cells in blood bone marrow and spleen etc.
