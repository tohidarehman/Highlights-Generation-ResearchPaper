 Stimuli responsive nanotechnology mediated drug co delivery system is a notable strategy to improve access of the systemically administered chemotherapeutics to the tumors . Herein a tailor made 2 3 dimethylmaleic anhydride poly

@highlight Charge switchable nanoparticles NPs were prepared through a green method.
@highlight Enhanced penetration and cellular uptake of NPs was realized by charge reverse.
@highlight Co delivery of doxorubicin and lapatinib exhibited synergistic anticancer activity.
@highlight The NPs compelled MCF 7 solid tumors to contract significantly or even vanish.
@highlight The NPs relieved the side effects and presented excellent biosecurity.
