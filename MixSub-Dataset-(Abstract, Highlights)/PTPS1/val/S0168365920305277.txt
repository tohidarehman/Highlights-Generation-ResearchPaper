 Bacterial therapy which presents a smart platform for delivering and producing therapeutic agents as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modes has provided a breakthrough for the treatment of a range of diseases . The integration of synthetic biology technology with bacteria enables their characteristics like chemotaxis and biomolecule secretion to outperform conventional diagnostics and therapeutics thereby facilitating their clinical applications in a range of diseases . Compared to injection administered bacteria orally delivered bacteria improve patient compliance while avoiding the risk of systemic infections . However oral administration of microbes always leads to a substantial loss of viability due to the highly acidic environment in the stomach and bile salt in the intestine . Thus the formulation of these bacteria into microcapsules using appropriate biomaterials is a promising approach for reducing cell death during gastrointestinal passage and controlling the release of these therapeutic cells across the intestinal tract . In this review we reveal the basic principles of oral bacterial delivery from internal genetic engineering approaches to external encapsulation and modification and summarize the most recent biomedical applications . Finally we discuss future trends in oral bacterial therapy as well as current challenges that need to be resolved to advance their clinical applications .

@highlight Oral administration of bacterial therapeutics is limited by their biocompatibility stability and efficiency
@highlight How genetic circuits and genetic engineering technologies to enable bacterial characteristics to outperform conventional diagnostics and therapeutics will be introduced.
@highlight The choice of biomaterials and technologies for therapeutic bacteria encapsulation is closely related to the improved efficiency of oral bacterial delivery.
