 Therapeutic interventions for infectious and inflammatory diseases are becoming increasingly challenging in terms of therapeutic resistance and side effects . Theranostic systems to ameliorate diagnosis and therapy are therefore highly warranted . The pathophysiological changes in inflammatory lesions provide an attractive basis for extravasation and accumulation of PEGylated liposomes . The objective of this study was to provide direct quantitative information on the theranostic potential of radiolabeled liposome for accumulation in inflammatory models using position emission tomography . Preclinical murine models of inflammation infection BLI demonstrated that the inflammatory and infectious models were successfully established and provided information on lesion pathology . Activity of The theranostic potential of long circulating PEGylated radiolabeled liposomes was shown in multiple preclinical models . Impressive accumulation was seen in both inflammatory and infectious lesions . These results are encouraging towards advancing PEGylated liposomes as imaging and drug delivery systems in inflammatory and infectious diseases .

@highlight Radiolabeled PEGylated liposomes display accumulation in inflammatory and infectious lesions across a range of preclinical mouse models.
@highlight Accumulation of PEGylated liposomes occur in both in the acute and chronic phases of inflammation.
@highlight Theranostic imaging using radiolabeled liposomes 
@highlight Cu liposomes has potential to guide diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.
