 Amino acids have attracted considerable attention in drug development because they play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes . In the past several decades various amino acid supplementations have been reported to have potential therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of many disorders in clinical trials . However their effectiveness is controversially reported which may be explained by poor pharmacokinetic properties of such low molecular weight agents . Amino acid based self assembled macromolecules could overcome the aforementioned drawbacks by improving the pharmacokinetic profile and accumulation of specific molecules at target sites to enhance the therapeutic effect . In this review we have discussed the current therapeutic applications of certain amino acids and have introduced our approach of using amino acid based self assembled nanostructures as novel therapeutic agents .

@highlight A landscape of amino acid therapeutics is overviewed.
@highlight The design of self assembled poly amino acid s as therapeutics is presented.
@highlight Self assembled poly amino acid s significantly improves the pharmacokinetics profile of amino acid.
@highlight The treatments of several poly amino acid based self assembled nano drugs are described as therapeutics on the animal models.
@highlight Designing the molecular self assembling drugs is a new concept of therapeutic development.
