 Exogenous dual delivery of progenitor cell population and therapeutic growth factors is one of alternative tissue engineering strategies for osteochondral tissue regeneration . In the present study an implantable dual delivery platform was developed using coacervates

@highlight The use of coacervates sufficiently protected a bioactivity of cargo IGF 1 and regulated its sustained release kinetics.
@highlight Coacervate mediated delivery of IGF 1 effectively facilitated chondrogenic differentiation of ADSCs.
@highlight Dual delivery of coacervate loadedIGF 1 and ADSCs using hydrogels synergistically augments osteochondral tissue repair.
@highlight Our coacervate embedded composite hydrogels could be a functional implantable osteochondral tissue engineering application.
