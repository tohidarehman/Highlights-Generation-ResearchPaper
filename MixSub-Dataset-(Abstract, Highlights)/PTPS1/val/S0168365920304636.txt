 To date many clinical trials have been carried out with neoantigen specific mRNA vaccines and positive results have been achieved . However further improvements in the efficiency of the intracellular delivery of mRNA and the production of a stronger immune response are still worth studying . In this study we used the cholesterol modified cationic peptide DP7 which was developed in our previous study with a transmembrane structure and immunoadjuvant function to modify DOTAP liposomes to create a common mRNA delivery system . This system was intended to improve the efficiency of the delivery of mRNA encoding individualized neoantigens to dendritic cells and enhance the activation of DCs . The system serves dual functions as a carrier and as an immunoadjuvant . As a carrier of mRNA DP7 C modified DOTAP liposomes could transfer mRNA efficiently into different type of DCs

@highlight DOTAP DP7 C liposome has double functions of delivery carrier and immune adjuvant.
@highlight DOTAP DP7 C liposome can increase the efficiency of mRNA intracellular delivery.
@highlight DOTAP DP7 C liposome has the ability to stimulate DC maturation.
@highlight DOTAP DP7 C liposome can improve the therapeutic effect of mRNA vaccine.
