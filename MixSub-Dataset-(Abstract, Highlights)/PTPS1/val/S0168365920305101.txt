 Glioblastoma multiforme is a particularly aggressive and malignant type of brain tumor notorious for its high recurrence rate and low survival rate . The treatment of GBM is challenging mainly because several issues associated with the GBM microenvironment have not yet been resolved . These obstacles originate from a variety of factors such as genetics anatomy and cytology all of which collectively hinder the treatment of GBM . Recent advances in materials and device engineering have presented new perspectives with regard to unconventional drug administration methods for GBM treatment . Such novel drug delivery approaches based on the clear understanding of the intrinsic properties of GBM have shown promise in overcoming some of the obstacles . In this review we first recapitulate the first line therapy and clinical challenges in the current treatment of GBM . Afterwards we introduce the latest technological advances in drug delivery strategies to improve the efficiency for GBM treatment mainly focusing on materials and devices . We describe such efforts by classifying them into two categories systemic and local drug delivery . Finally we discuss unmet challenges and prospects for the clinical translation of these drug delivery technologies .
