 Nanogels as a versatile vehicle for doxorubicin have attracted great attention during the last decade . Since a nanogel composite device transport encapsulated drugs to the site of action and release them in a desirable time frame it could provide higher therapeutic effect . By implementation of different polymers polymer inorganic NPs and various crosslinking chemistry it is possible to fabricate novel composite nanogel systems with favorable characteristics such as smart intelligent systems or multipurpose platforms . Due to high stability good drug loading capacity for hydrophobic and hydrophilic agents nanogels introduce great opportunity in pharmaceutical innovations . Composite nanogels show capability in gene drug and diagnostic agents delivery while providing an ideal platform for theranostic purposes as multifunctional systems . Doxorubicin as an anticancer agent is widely used against numerous cancers . Due to high systemic toxicity of doxorubicin there is still need for its safe and specific delivery to the site of action . In this regard so many efforts have been put in by the researchers for preparation of different nanogel formulations of doxorubicin in order to produce more efficient formulations . This review focuses on design fabrication advantages and disadvantages of composite nanogel based doxorubicin formulations .
