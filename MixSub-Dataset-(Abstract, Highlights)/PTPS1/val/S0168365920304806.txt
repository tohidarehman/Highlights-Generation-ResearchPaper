 To cater to medication needs in the future healthcare system we need to shift from the conventional system of drug delivery to modern molecular signature based drug delivery systems . The current drug therapies are either less effective ineffective or produce numerous adverse reactions . One scientific principle or discipline can not adequately address all the problems so we need an innovative application of the current scientific principles . Here we are proposing a novel concept of nanoformulation based on pharmacogenomics and theranostics for personalized error free and targeted therapeutic agent delivery . The addition of more knowledge about the human genome opens the new way to study disease gene gene drug and drug effect interactions which is the basis of future medicines . Pharmacogenomics provides information about the disease etiology role in genes in disease pathophysiology disease biomarkers drug targets drug effects and the fate of drugs inside the body . Theranostics approach utilizes the above information in diagnosis treatment and monitoring of the disease on a real time basis . Personalized dosage forms can be formulated into a nanoformulation that provides a better therapeutic effect and minimizes adverse drug reactions . The therapeutic system needs to be shifted from the principle of one drug fits all to one drug unique population . In the present manuscript we tried to conceptualize a modern therapeutic system by combining the three approaches viz . pharmacogenomics theranostics and nanotechnology applied in the area of formulation development to produce a multifunctional single tiny entity .

@highlight Conventional drug therapy many limitations such as drug resistance evolution of pathogens and life style diseases.
@highlight Integration of pharmacogenomics and theranostics approaches has immense potential in the area of targeted drug delivery.
@highlight Nanotechnology provides the suitable and effective mean of delivering the drug to the desired site.
@highlight Quality by design QbD concept helps in designing and developing an error free dosage form.
@highlight The integration of all these approach has the promise for future medicines.
