 Due to the rapid changes that have occurred in the field of drug discovery and the recent developments in the early 21st century the role of drug delivery systems has become increasingly more important . For the past 20years our laboratory has been developing gene delivery systems based on lipid based delivery systems . One of our efforts has been directed toward developing a multifunctional envelope type nano device by modifying the particle surface with octaarginine which resulted in a remarkably enhanced cellular uptake and improved intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA . When we moved to
