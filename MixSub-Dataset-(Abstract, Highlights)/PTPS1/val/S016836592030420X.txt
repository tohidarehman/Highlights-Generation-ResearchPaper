 With the rapid development of conjugation chemistry and biomedical nanotechnology prodrug based nanosystems have emerged as promising drug delivery nanoplatforms . Dimeric prodrug as an emerging branch of prodrug has been widely investigated by covalently conjugating two same or different drug molecules . In recent years great progress has been made in dimeric prodrug based nanosystems for cancer therapy . Many advantages offered by DPNS have significantly facilitated the delivery efficiency of anticancer drugs such as high drug loading capacity favorable pharmacokinetics tumor stimuli sensitive drug release and facile combination theranostics . Given the rapid developments in this field we here outline the latest updates of DPNS in cancer treatment focusing on dimeric prodrug encapsulated nanosystems dimeric prodrug nanoassemblies and tumor stimuli responsive DPNS . Moreover the design principle advantages and challenges of DPNS for clinical cancer therapy are also highlighted .
