 Harnessing the bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system for genome editing in eukaryotes has revolutionized basic biomedical research and translational sciences . The ability to create targeted alterations of the genome through this easy to design system has presented unprecedented opportunities to treat inherited disorders and other diseases such as cancer through gene therapy . A major hurdle is the lack of an efficient and safe
