 Buccal drug delivery offers a potential non invasive means of delivering therapeutics to patients . Despite the promise the feasibility of transporting proteins and peptides into systemic circulation from buccal administration remains a daunting challenge . Here we report the fabrication of a biodegradable polymeric patch for buccal delivery of insulin using chitosan as the mucoadhesive matrix and ionic liquids deep eutectic solvent as the transport facilitator . Insulin is mixed with ILs DES made from Choline and Geranic acid to form a viscoelastic CAGE gel and sandwiched between two layers of a biodegradable polymer . The rheological properties of the CAGE gel were dominated by the elastic modulus and suggested a solid like viscoelastic behavior . CAGE induced a 7 fold increase in the cumulative insulin transport across the
