 Despite the various mechanisms that involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction are the key events leading to cognition impairment . Therefore neuroprotection and neurogenesis would provide essential alternatives to the rescue of AD cognitive function . Here we demonstrated that extracellular vesicles secreted from adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells entered the brain quickly and efficiently following intranasal administration and majorly accumulated in neurons within the central nervous system . Proteomics analysis showed that EVs contained multiple proteins possessing neuroprotective and neurogenesis activities and neuronal RNA sequencing showed genes enrichment in neuroprotection and neurogenesis following the treatment with EVs . As a result EVs exerted powerful neuroprotective effect on A

@highlight ADSCs derived EVs enter the brain quickly and efficiently following intranasal administration.
@highlight ADSCs derived EVs contain multiple proteins possessing neuroprotective and neurogenesis activities.
@highlight ADSCs derived EVs treatment induces upregulation of genes involved in neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth in neurons.
@highlight ADSCs derived EVs ameliorate neuronal damage promote neurogenesis and rescue memory deficits in APP PS1 transgenic mice.
