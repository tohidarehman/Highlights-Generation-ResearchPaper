 Polypeptides are useful in designing protein polypeptide conjugates for therapeutic applications however they are not satisfactory in improving the stability of therapeutic proteins and extending their in vivo half life . Here we show that thermally induced self assembly of elastin like polypeptide diblock copolymer fused interferon alpha IFN ELP

@highlight Thermally induced self assembly of protein diblock copolypeptide conjugate into micelles.
@highlight The micelles exhibit enhanced stability and pharmacology.
@highlight The micelles outperform PEGylated protein in pharmacology.
