 Advances in nanomedicine including early cancer detection targeted drug delivery and personalized approaches to cancer treatment are on the rise . For example targeted drug delivery systems can improve intracellular delivery because of their multifunctionality . Novel endogenous based and exogenous based stimulus responsive drug delivery systems have been proposed to prevent the cancer progression with proper drug delivery . To control effective dose loading and sustained release targeted permeability and individual variability can now be described in more complex ways such as by combining internal and external stimuli . Despite these advances in release control certain challenges remain and are identified in this research which emphasizes the control of drug release and applications of nanoparticle based drug delivery systems . Using a multiscale and multidisciplinary approach this study investigates and analyzes drug delivery and release strategies in the nanoparticle based treatment of cancer both mathematically and clinically .

@highlight Nanoparticles have great potential to improve the efficacy of drug delivery.
@highlight The drug release rate and mechanism significantly increase nano based drug delivery system efficacy.
@highlight Stimulus responsive nanocarriers external and internal promise better control of drug release.
@highlight Mathematical models usefully explicate and predict clinical translation.
@highlight Combining internal and external nanocarrier stimuli enables controlled targeted drug delivery.
