 As the combination of photothermal therapy with immunotherapy provides an effective strategy in cancer treatment a magnetic nanoparticle delivery system was constructed to load indocyanine green and immunostimulator R837 hydrochloride for spatio temporally PTT immunotherapy synergism in cancer . This delivery system is composed of Fe

@highlight A magnetic nanoparticle is used as a carrier for magnetic tumor targeting.
@highlight Great superparamagnetism of this platform provides a visible treatment by MRI.
@highlight Magnetic accumulation of ICG in tumor enhances the PTT effect.
@highlight Controlled release of R837 further strengthens the immune response caused by PTT.
@highlight This strategy shows great performance in three clinically relevant tumor models.
