 Nanoparticles that permit active targeting promise to play a key role in cancer therapy moving forward . However in order to successfully advance into clinic these delivery platforms not only must target individual tumoural cellular components but also require safe efficient and scalable production . Herein we review recent and innovative targeted nanoparticle delivery strategies to individual TME components including cancer associated blood and lymphatic vessels pericytes cancer associated fibroblasts and cancer stem cells . In contrast to traditional therapies that promote widespread ablation emerging nano strategies that specifically modulate different cell populations of the TME such as targeting pericytes and endothelial cells for vascular normalization are proving to effectively deliver therapeutics to tumours . Additionally new smart targeted NPs with transformable characteristics responsive to specific tumour microenvironmental cues demonstrate enhanced spatiotemporal control over cell targeting and therapeutic release . However translating these therapies to the clinic requires overcoming several significant barriers such as failure to recapitulate the human TME in animal models and issues with NP targeting efficacy safety and scalable production . We discuss recent efforts to overcome these challenges and innovative means to reduce off target toxicities . We also highlight important deficiencies in current NP development and offer new perspectives on the design of pre clinical and clinical trials to accelerate clinical translation of targeted NP platforms .

@highlight Clinical translation requires a better understanding of human tumour microenvironment.
@highlight Microenvironmental factors can be harnessed to aid in more precise active targeting.
@highlight Early clinical testing can hasten clinical translation of targeted nanoplatforms.
@highlight Targeted nanoparticle therapies need to be adapted to personalised medicine.
