 The blood brain barrier is a dynamic diffusional barrier regulating the molecular and chemical flux between the blood and brain thereby preserving cerebral homeostasis . Endothelial cells form the core anatomical component of the BBB based on properties such as specialized junctional complexes between cells which restricts paracellular transport and extremely low levels of vesicular transport restricting transcytosis . In performing its protective function the BBB also constrains the entry of therapeutics into the brain hampering the treatment of various neurological disorders . Focused ultrasound is a novel therapeutic modality that has shown efficacy in transiently and non invasively opening the BBB for the targeted delivery of therapeutics to the brain . Although the ability of ultrasound to disrupt the junctional assembly of endothelial cells has been partially investigated its effect on the transcellular mode of transport has been largely neglected . In this study we found that ultrasound induces a pronounced increase in the levels of the vesicle forming protein caveolin 1 . In order to investigate the role of vesicle mediated transcytoplasmic transport we compared the leakage of various cargo sizes between a mouse model that lacks caveolin 1 and wild type mice following sonication of the hippocampus . The absence of caveolin 1 did not lead to overt abnormalities in the cerebral vasculature in the mice . We found that caveolin 1 has a critical role specifically in the transport of large but not smaller cargoes . Our findings indicate differential effects of therapeutic ultrasound on cellular transport mechanisms with implications for therapeutic interventions .

@highlight Low intensity focused ultrasound FUS achieves safe and reproducible blood brain barrier BBB opening of the hippocampus.
@highlight Levels of the vesicle forming protein caveolin 1 cav1 are significantly increased in the sonicated hippocampus.
@highlight Similar leakage of small 3 kDa and medium 70 kDa dextran between cav1 knock out and wild type mice after sonication.
@highlight Leakage of 500 kDa dextran was significantly reduced in the cav1 knock out mice. No influx observed for 2000 kDa dextran.
@highlight The results suggest a critical role for transcytosis in the transport of larger cargoes following FUS mediated BBB opening.
