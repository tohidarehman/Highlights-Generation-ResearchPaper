 Infectious keratitis caused by bacterial biofilms is one of the main causes of corneal blindness presenting a serious threat to public health . In this study matrix metalloproteinase sensitive supramolecular nanoparticles were constructed for enhancing photodynamic antibacterial effect against biofilm associated bacterial keratitis . MMP S NPs were prepared by host guest self assembly of chlorin e6 conjugated cyclodextrin prodrug and MMP 9 sensitive peptides terminated with adamantane . MMP S NPs with EEEEEE peptide shell had a negatively charged surface preventing adhesion to the normal ocular surface or healthy corneal cells thus enhancing tear retention time . After arriving at the infected lesions the protective EEEEEE peptide shell of MMP S NPs was removed triggered by overexpressed MMP 9 in the keratitis microenvironment . The subsequently exposed cationic peptides helped the nanoparticles penetrate and accumulate in biofilms as well as bind to Gram negative bacteria

@highlight MMP 9 sensitive supramolecular nanoparticles were obtained by the host guest interaction.
@highlight The nanoparticles could effectively penetrate and accumulate into the biofilms as well as bind to
@highlight The nanoparticles had enhanced photodynamic antibacterial effect triggered by overexpressed MMP 9 in biofilm environment.
@highlight The nanoparticles exhibited superior PDT of bacteria elimination and biofilm eradication in cornea.
