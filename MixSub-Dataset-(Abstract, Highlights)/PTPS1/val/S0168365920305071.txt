 Lung metastasis of breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer related death in women . Herein we attempted to simultaneously inhibit the growth and lung metastasis of breast cancer by delivering quercetin using LyP 1 functionalized regenerated silk fibroin based nanoparticles . The generated LyP 1 QU NPs had a desirable diameter and a negatively charged surface . Interestingly these NPs exhibited intrinsic responsibilities when triggered by various stimulating factors in the tumor microenvironment .

@highlight LyP 1 functionalized nanoparticles NPs were fabricated for breast tumor targeted delivery of quercetin QU .
@highlight LyP 1 QU NPs had a particle size around 203.2nm narrow size distribution and negative surface charge 12.7mV .
@highlight LyP 1 QU NPs exhibited intrinsic pH H
@highlight  GSH responsibilities.
@highlight LyP 1 QU NPs showed obviously inhibitory effects on the proliferation migration and invasion of 4T1 cells.
@highlight LyP 1 QU NPs could be accumulated in tumor tissues and inhibit the growth and lung metastasis of breast cancer.
