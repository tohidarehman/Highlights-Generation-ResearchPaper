 APOMAB is a dead tumour cell targeting antibody which has been used preclinically as a diagnostic agent and therapeutically as a radioimmunotherapy and antibody drug conjugate . However little is known of the intra tumour processing of chDAB4 when bound to dead tumour cells . In this study we examine the role of macrophages in the

@highlight Tumour associated macrophages TAMs contribute significantly to tumoral processing of antibody drug and radio conjugates
@highlight TAMs process radiolabelled and antibody drug conjuate ADC versions of the dead tumour cell targeting antibody chDAB4
@highlight Depletion of TAMs decreased tumour residualisation of radiolabelled chDAB4 and reduced the anti tumour activity of chDAB4 ADC
