@highlight FcRn binding properties of engineered human albumin were retained post conjugation.
@highlight NPs KP high binder is transported in a FcRn dependent manner and more efficiently.
@highlight NPs KP present a higher hypoglycemic effect reducing around 40 of glycemia after 1h.
@highlight Engineered albumin variants are promising surface functional moieties.
