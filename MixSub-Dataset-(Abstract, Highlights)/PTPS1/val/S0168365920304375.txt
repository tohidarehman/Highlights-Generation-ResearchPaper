 Mitochondria play crucial roles in a variety of cellular physiological processes mitochondria accumulating drug delivery has drawn pronounced attention in the field of cancer theranostics . Camptothecin is a DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitor and exerts a broad spectrum anticancer profile . Berberine is able to perferably enter into cancer cell mitochondria and trigger the cell apoptosis . In this work CPT and BBR were combined together through GSH responsible disulfide bond and then co assembled with photosensitizer indocyanine green into nanodrugs which was driven through hydrophobic stacking and especially electrostatic interactions of anions and cations as found by molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations . Our developed nanodrugs displayed an average size of 168nm and showed exceptional instability by irradiation presence acid condition and high concentration of GSH thereby eliciting the rapid disassembly and accelerating drug release . The better therapy effect of CPT ss BBR ICG NPs on A549 cells might be attributed to triply stimuli responsive rapid disassembly preferable accumulation into mitochondria and combined chemotherapy and photothermal therapy all of which directly rendered the notable loss of mitochondria membrane potential high level of reactive oxygen species in cancer cells accelerated the apoptosis of cancer cells and repressed the growth of tumors .

@highlight New mitochondria targeting CPT ss BBR ICG NPs were developed.
@highlight Prepared nanodrugs showed NIR GSH pH sensitive drug release characteristics.
@highlight Computer simulation studies rationalized the co assembly process of CPT ss BBR and ICG.
@highlight CPT ss BBR ICG NPs exhibited better anticancer activity by acting on mitochondria.
