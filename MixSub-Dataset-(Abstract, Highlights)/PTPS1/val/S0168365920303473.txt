 Peri prosthetic joint infections are a serious adverse event following joint replacement surgeries antibiotics are usually added to bone cement to prevent infection offset . For uncemented prosthesis alternative antimicrobial approaches are necessary in order to prevent PJI however despite elution of drug from the surface of the device being shown one of the most promising approach no effective antimicrobial eluting uncemented device is currently available on the market . Consequently there is a clinical need for non antibiotic antimicrobial uncemented prosthesis as these devices present numerous benefits particularly for young patients over cemented artificial joints . Moreover non antibiotic approaches are driven by the need to address the growing threat posed by antibiotic resistance .
