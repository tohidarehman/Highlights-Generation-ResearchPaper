 Electrospinning has emerged as most viable approach for the fabrication of nanofibers with several beneficial features that are essential to various applications ranging from environment to biomedicine . The electrospun nanofiber based drug delivery systems have shown tremendous advancements over the controlled and sustained release complemented from their high surface area tunable porosity mechanical endurance offer compatible environment for drug encapsulation biocompatibility high drug loading and tailorable release characteristics . The dosage formulation of poorly water soluble drugs often faces several challenges including complete dissolution with maximum therapeutic efficiency over a short period of time especially through oral administration . In this context challenges associated with the dosage formulation of poorly water soluble drugs can be addressed through combining the beneficial features of electrospun nanofibers . This review describes major developments progressed in the preparation of electrospun nanofibers based fast dissolving drug delivery systems by employing variety of polymers drug molecules and encapsulation approaches with primary focus on oral delivery . Furthermore the review also highlights current scientific challenges and provide an outlook with regard to future prospectus .
