 Bilirubin is a yellow colored metabolite of heme degradation once believed to be toxic but recently recognized as a powerful endogenous antioxidant of physiologic importance . During the past two decades several studies have demonstrated the potential of bilirubin in theranostic applications . Here this paper summarizes the current state of the field providing a detailed review of the published literature on the theranostic applications of bilirubin conjugated nanoparticles and the basis and mechanisms underlying their efficacy . This review covers the analytical description of the construction of the nanoparticulate bilirubin system primary mechanisms of therapeutic action drug delivery and imaging potential . It also lays out the possible translational future of bilirubin conjugated nanoparticles in therapy and diagnosis .

@highlight Bilirubin exhibits antioxidative antinflammatory and immune regulatory properties.
@highlight Bilirubin biliverdin act as photoactive components for theranostic use.
@highlight Bilirubin nanomedicine increase the drug solubility stability and targetability.
@highlight Bilirubin act as a multi functional component to build nanostructure.
