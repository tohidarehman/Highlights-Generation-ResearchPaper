 The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of human serum albumin as a solubilising agent drug delivery vehicle for pulmonary administration of antimycobacterial benzothiazinone compounds . The solubility of four novel BTZ compounds was enhanced 2 to 140 fold by incubation with albumin . Tryptophan 213 residue quenching studies indicated moderate binding strength to Sudlow s site I. Nanoparticle manufacture achieved 3760 encapsulation efficiency in HSA particles . Drug release was triggered by proteases with 50 released in 4h . The antimycobacterial activity of IR 20 and FG 2 loaded in HSA nanoparticles was enhanced compared to DMSO phosphate buffered saline or albumin PBS solutions in an

@highlight The study demonstrated the following assurances of clinical translatability.
@highlight Benzothiazinones were encapsulated and showed controlled released from the particle carrier.
@highlight Antitubercular efficacy was shown in a controlled biorelevant
@highlight bioassay.
@highlight Benzothiazinone compounds in solution and in albumin nanoparticles were effective
@highlight pulmonary delivery.
@highlight THE albumin nanoparticles can be formulated as an aerosol medicine.
