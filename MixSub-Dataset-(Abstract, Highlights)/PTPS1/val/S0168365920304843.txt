 Organ transplantation remains the gold standard therapeutic option for patients with end stage organ failure . However there have been few improvements in the management of post transplant immunosuppression . As the long term use of immunosuppressive agents may result in off target systemic toxicity and complications minimizing the ISA dosage while preserving the pharmacological efficacy could be a promising solution to address these challenges . Here we present the design and application of self assembled prodrug nanoparticles based on chemically derived mycophenolate mofetil which further provide a hydrophobic core to noncovalently encapsulate additional ISAs such as tacrolimus . The resulting immunosuppressant cocktail nanoparticles are further refined by PEGylation with amphiphilic polymers to form colloidally stable self assembled immunosuppressant cocktails

@highlight PUFAylation of immunosuppressive agents ISAs enabled self assembly of the prodrugs into injectable nanoparticles.
