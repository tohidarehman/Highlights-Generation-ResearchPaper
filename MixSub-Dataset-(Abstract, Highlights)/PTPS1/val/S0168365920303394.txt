 Cisplatin is widely used in the chemoradiotherapy of cervical cancers . However despite the severe systemic side effects the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin is often compromised by the development of drug resistance which is closely related to the elevated intracellular thiol containing species and the adenosine triphosphate dependent glutathione S conjugate pumps . The construction of a safe and redox sensitive nano sensitizer with high disulfide density and high Pt prodrug loading capacity as described herein is a promising way to overcome the cisplatin resistance and enhance the CRT efficacy . The optimized nanoparticles referred to as

@highlight Reduction sensitive nano carrier quantitatively encapsulated prodrug molecules 
@highlight Prodrug nanomedicine greatly improved the safety profiles of cisplatin 
@highlight Prodrug strategies overcame cisplatin resistance by GSH consumption and mitochondrial targeting 
@highlight Prodrug nano sensitizer enabled efficient chemoradiotherapy in cisplatin resistant cancer model.
