 RNA therapeutics have received much attention in the development of anti cancer therapies . Among them synthetic mRNA was investigated for cancer immunotherapy due to its abilities to express tumor associated antigens with stimulation of immune responses in dendritic cells . Despite of its great potential several hurdles were remained such as insufficient immune stimulation and DC maturation . In this study we aimed to present a novel IVT mRNA that can simultaneously express tumor associated antigens while suppress STAT3 proteins . Combined functions of siRNA and IVT mRNA were investigated and the hybrid structure of siRNA tailed mRNA was developed . We prepared the ChriST mRNA by employing polyA tail structures with RNAi sequences at the 3 end of mRNA . Complementary strands were annealed to form duplex siRNA structure to induce STAT3 gene silencing . In addition a hybrid structure of DNA RNA was introduced into the ChriST mRNA between polyA tail and RNAi sequences . It was expected that DNA RNA duplex would be readily cleaved by RNase H in the intracellular environment . After the cleavage ChriST mRNA was fully functionalized in cells and exhibited enhanced tumor specific DC maturation .

@highlight Combined hybrid of siRNA tailed mRNA ChriST mRNA functioned as siRNA and mRNA to simultaneous suppress and express protein.
@highlight siRNA and mRNA structures were separated from the ChriST mRNA by RNase H mediated cleavage of RNA DNA hybrid structure.
