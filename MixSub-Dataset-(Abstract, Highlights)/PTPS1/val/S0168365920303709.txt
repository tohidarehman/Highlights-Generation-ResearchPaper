 Additive manufacturing processes used to create regenerative bone tissue engineered implants are not biocompatible thereby restricting direct use with stem cells and usually require cell seeding post fabrication . Combined delivery of stem cells with the controlled release of osteogenic factors within a mechanically strong biomaterial combined during manufacturing would replace injectable defect fillers and allow personalized implants to be rapidly prototyped by 3D bioprinting .
