 In this study a system for oral delivery of docetaxel was prepared to enhance the oral absorption and anticancer efficacy of DTX

@highlight DTX LMC loaded nanoemulsion DLNE increased solubility and permeability of DTX.
@highlight DA TAP anchored DLNE enhanced the permeation of DTX
@highlight ASBT mediated uptake.
@highlight DLNE incorporating TPGS showed an inhibitory effect on P gp mediated efflux of DTX.
@highlight The oral bioavailability of DLNE with DA TAP and TPGS was greater than that of DTX.
@highlight Metronomic DLNE containing DA TAP and TPGS showed enhanced anticancer efficacy.
