 The diagnosis and treatment of neurological ailments always remain an utmost challenge for research fraternity due to the presence of BBB . The intranasal route appeared as an attractive and alternative route for brain targeting of therapeutics without the intrusion of BBB and GI exposure . This route directly and effectively delivers the therapeutics to different regions of the brain via olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways . However shorter drug retention time and mucociliary clearance curtail the efficiency of the intranasal route . The
