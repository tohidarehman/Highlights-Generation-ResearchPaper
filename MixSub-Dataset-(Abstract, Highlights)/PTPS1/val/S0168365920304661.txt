 Selective inhibition of microRNAs offers a new avenue for cancer therapeutics . While most of the current anti miRNA reagents target full length miRNAs here we investigate novel nanoparticle delivered short PNA probes containing cationic domains targeting the seed region of the miRNA for effective antimiR therapy . For proof of concept we tested PNAs targeting miRNA 155 and employed poly lactic

@highlight Short cationic anti seed PNAs can efficiently inhibit the action of target oncomiRs.
@highlight PLGA NPs containing short arginine PNAs exhibit superior transfection efficiency.
@highlight Short anti seed PNA loaded PLGA NPs prevents tumor growth in a xenograft mice model of lymphoma.
@highlight Proposed anti seed PNA strategy is cost effective and clinically translatable.
