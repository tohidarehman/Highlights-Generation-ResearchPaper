 Bone marrow is the central immunological organ and the origin of hematological diseases . Efficient and specific drug delivery to the BM is an unmet need . We tested delivery of fluorescent indocarbocyanine lipids as a model lipophilic cargo via different carriers . Systemically injected T lymphocyte cell line Jurkat delivered ICLs to the BM more efficiently than erythrocytes and more selectively than PEGylated liposomes . Near infrared imaging showed that the delivery was restricted to the BM lungs liver and spleen with no accumulation in the kidneys brain heart intestines fat tissue and pancreas . Following systemic injection of ICL labeled cells in immunodeficient or immunocompetent mice few cells arrived in the BM intact . However between 5 and 10 of BM cells were ICL positive . Confocal microscopy of intact BM confirmed that ICLs are delivered independently of the injected cells . Flow cytometry analysis showed that the lipid accumulated in both CD11b and CD11b cells and in hematopoietic progenitors . In a xenograft model of acute myeloid leukemia a single injection of 10 million Jurkat cells delivered DiD to 15 of the tumor cells . ICL labeled cells disappeared from blood almost immediately post intravenous injection but numerous cell derived microparticles continued to circulate in blood . The microparticle particle formation was not due to the ICL labeling or complement attack and was observed after injection of both syngeneic and xenogeneic cells . Injection of microparticles produced
