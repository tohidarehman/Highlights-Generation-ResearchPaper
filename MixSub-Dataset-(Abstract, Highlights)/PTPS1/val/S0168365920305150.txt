 Inflammation is intimately related to the pathogenesis of numerous acute and chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease inflammatory bowel disease rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegenerative diseases . Therefore anti inflammatory therapy is a very promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of these inflammatory diseases . To overcome the shortcomings of existing anti inflammatory agents and their traditional formulations such as nonspecific tissue distribution and uncontrolled drug release bioresponsive drug delivery systems have received much attention in recent years . In this review we first provide a brief introduction of the pathogenesis of inflammation with an emphasis on representative inflammatory cells and mediators in inflammatory microenvironments that serve as pathological fundamentals for rational design of bioresponsive carriers . Then we discuss different materials and delivery systems responsive to inflammation associated biochemical signals such as pH reactive oxygen species and specific enzymes . Also applications of various bioresponsive drug delivery systems in the treatment of typical acute and chronic inflammatory diseases are described . Finally crucial challenges in the future development and clinical translation of bioresponsive anti inflammatory drug delivery systems are highlighted .

@highlight Inflammation is closely related to the pathogenesis of many acute chronic diseases.
@highlight Low pH and high reactive oxygen species or enzymes are typical inflammatory cues.
@highlight Inflammatory cues are useful triggers for rational design of drug delivery systems.
@highlight Bioresponsive drug delivery systems are beneficial for treating inflammation.
@highlight Translation studies are necessary for anti inflammatory bioresponsive therapies.
