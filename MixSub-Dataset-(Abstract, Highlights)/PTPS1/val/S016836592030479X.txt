 The combination of photothermal and photodynamic therapy shows pronounced potential as a prominent therapeutic strategy for tumor treatment . However the efficacy is limited by insufficient tumor targeted delivery of PTT and PDT reagents and the hypoxic nature of the tumor microenvironment . To overcome these limitations tumor acidity responsive lipid membrane enclosed perfluorooctyl bromide oil droplet nanoparticles surface modified with

@highlight Smart oil droplets were developed for photothermal photodynamic combined therapy.
@highlight pH induced charge conversion on NP surfaces highly enhanced cellular uptake.
@highlight Oil droplet NPs carried oxygen and accumulated in tumor significantly.
@highlight Oxygen supply modulated tumor hypoxia and enhanced photodynamic therapy.
@highlight Functionalized phototherapy oil droplets effectively suppressed tumor growth.
