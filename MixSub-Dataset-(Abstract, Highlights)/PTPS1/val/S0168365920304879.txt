 One of the most promising approaches for the treatment of colorectal cancer is targeting epidermal growth factor receptor . Comprehensive research has led to significant clinical outcomes using EGFR targeted anticancer drugs however the response to these drugs still largely varies among individuals . The current diagnostic platform provides limited information that does not enable successful prediction of the anticancer performance of EGFR targeted drugs . Here we developed a EGFR targeted activatable probe for predicting therapeutic efficacy of EGFR targeted doxorubicin prodrug in colorectal cancer therapy . The EGF conjugated fluorescence activatable probe and EGF conjugated doxorubicin prodrug were both fabricated using peptide substrates that can be dissociated by lysosomal enzymes and thus share an intracellular mechanism of action . We demonstrated that after EGFR mediated endocytosis lysosomal enzymes de quench the fluorescence of EGF probe and activate the cytotoxicity of EGF prodrug . When evaluated

@highlight EGF probe exhibits a cancer specific imaging with reduced background signals.
@highlight EGF probe and EGF prodrug share an intracellular mechanism of action.
@highlight Therapeutic efficacy of EGF prodrug can be predicted using EGF probe.
@highlight Their actions are dependent on the lysosomal activity rather than EGFR level.
