 Epidermal growth factor receptor involved in cell proliferation and migration is overexpressed in 50 of glioblastomas . Anti EGFR based strategies using monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab have been proposed for central nervous system cancer therapy . However the blood brain barrier drastically restricts their brain penetration which limits their efficacy for the treatment of glioblastomas . Herein a longitudinal PET imaging study was performed to assess the relevance and the impact of focused ultrasound mediated BBB permeabilization on the brain exposure to the anti EGFR mAb CTX over time . For this purpose FUS permeabilization process with microbubbles was applied on intact BBB mouse brain before the injection of

@highlight FUS and MB significantly increase the delivery of CTX across the BBB.
@highlight PET is a powerful method to assess the PK of the passage of mAb through the BBB.
@highlight Zr DFO CTX was used to follow quantitatively enhanced brain exposure to CTX.
@highlight ImmunoPET combined FUS is a clinically relevant strategy for GBM innovative therapy.
