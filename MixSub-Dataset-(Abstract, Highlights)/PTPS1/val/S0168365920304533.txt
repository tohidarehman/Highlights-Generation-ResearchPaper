 Biologic therapeutics are the medicines of the future and are destined to transform the approaches by which the causes and symptoms of diseases are cured and alleviated . These approaches will be accelerated through the development of novel strategies that target multiple pharmacologically active sites using a combination of different biologics or mixtures of biologics and small molecule therapeutics . However for this potential to be realised advancements in co formulation strategies for biologic therapeutics must be established . This review describes the current and emerging developments within this field and highlights the challenges and potential solutions that will pave the way towards their clinical translation .
