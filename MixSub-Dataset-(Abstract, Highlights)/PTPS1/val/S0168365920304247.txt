 Carbon monoxide is a known endogenous signaling molecule with potential therapeutic indications in treating inflammation cancer neuroprotection and sickle cell disease among many others . One of the hurdles in using CO as a therapeutic agent is the development of pharmaceutically acceptable delivery forms for various indications . Along this line we have developed organic CO prodrugs that allow for packing this gaseous molecule into a dosage form for the goal of carbon monoxide in a pill . This should enable non inhalation administration including oral and intravenous routes . These prodrugs have previously demonstrated efficacy in multiple animal models . To further understand the CO delivery efficiency of these prodrugs in relation to their efficacy we undertook the first pharmacokinetic studies on these prodrugs . In doing so we selected five representative prodrugs with different CO release kinetics and examined their pharmacokinetics after administration

@highlight For the first time the pharmacokinetics of organic CO prodrugs was evaluated in mice.
@highlight The interplay among CO release kinetics of CO prodrugs route of administration and CO delivery efficiency was explored.
@highlight Organic CO prodrugs demonstrate great promise for oral CO delivery towards the goal of CO in a pill.
