 Multifunctional nanosystems that can transport therapeutic and diagnostic agents into tumor sites and activate their respective functions via tumor microenvironment recognition are highly desirable for clinical applications . We fabricated pH and redox dual activatable self assembled nanotheranostics via coordination driven self assembly of chlorin e6 disulfide linked pH sensitive polymer ligand poly isobutylene

@highlight Preparation of self assembled nanotheranostics with dual activatable function.
@highlight DA SNs can prolong blood circulation time enhance tumor accumulation and cellular uptake.
@highlight DA SNs could serve as a dual modal MR fluorescence imaging probe for tumor targeting diagnosis.
@highlight The Ce6 activation mechanism is critical for its therapeutic activity.
