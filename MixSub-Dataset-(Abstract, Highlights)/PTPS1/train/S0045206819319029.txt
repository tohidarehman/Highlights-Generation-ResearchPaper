 Xanthine oxidase is a critical target for the therapy of hyperuricemia and gout . In this study a number of 3 4 alkoxy 3 1

@highlight 3 4 Alkoxy 3 1
@highlight  tetrazol 1 yl phenyl 1 2 4 oxadiazol 5 4
@highlight  ones were synthesized.
@highlight Compound
@highlight exhibited a promising XO inhibitory potency with an IC
@highlight value of 0.121M.
@highlight The structure activity relationships of the synthesized compounds were summarized.
@highlight Molecular modeling enzyme kinetics studies and a hyperuricemia rat model investigation were performed.
@highlight The 1 2 4 oxadiazol 5 4
@highlight  one moiety could be used to design novel XO inhibitors.
