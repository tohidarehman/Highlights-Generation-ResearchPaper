 Direct acting antiviral drugs are becoming therapeutics of choice for the treatment of viral infections . Successful development of anti HIV and HCV drugs by targeting the viral proteases has provided impetus for discovering newer DAADs . Dengue virus protease which is composed of two nonstructural proteins NS2B and NS3pro can be likewise exploited for discovering new anti dengue therapeutics . In this study we have linked together two pharmaceutically interesting motifs namely 1 3 4 oxadiazole and benzenesulfonamide in two alternative series to develop novel
