 Parkinsons disease is a movement disorder associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons . PD treatment remains unsatisfactory as the current synthetic drugs in clinical use relies on managing only motor symptoms . This study investigated antioxidant potentials of selected compounds namely 5 6 7 4 tetramethoxyflavone

@highlight Rotenone induced neurotoxicity in
@highlight model of Parkinsons disease.
@highlight Plants derived flavonoids and polyketides reduced the oxidative stress in the brain.
@highlight Flavonoids and polyketides rescued the locomotor behaviour deficit.
@highlight Overall studied compounds have high antioxidant potentials.
