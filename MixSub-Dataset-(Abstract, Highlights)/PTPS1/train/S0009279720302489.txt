 Oncogenic alterations in the BRAF gene are identified in an estimate of 50 of melanomas and cause melanoma development . BRAF kinase inhibitors including vemurafenib and dabrafenib were discovered and used in the clinical treatment of BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma . Though BRAFi s therapeutic advantages are short term and short lived associated with drug resistance . Although a few pathways of developed BRAFi resistance have also been established in approximately 40 of melanomas the cause for inherited resistance remains unclear . Recognizing a new process of developed BRAFi resistance might provide new possibilities to successfully treat BRAF mutant melanoma . In this study we are exploring the compensatory alternative pathway followed by BRAFi MEKi treated resistant cell for maintaining the long term integrity and survival .

@highlight BRAFi were used in the clinical treatment of BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.
@highlight BRAFi s therapeutic advantages are short term associated with drug resistance.
@highlight Rho regulated gene transcription is a promising therapeutic approach to restore sensitivity to BRAFi resistant tumors.
