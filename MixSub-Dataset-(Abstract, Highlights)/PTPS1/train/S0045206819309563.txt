 Our recently successful identification of benzoic acid based DPP 4 inhibitors spurs the further quest for in depth structure activity relationships study in S

@highlight Novel benzamide fragments were designed to target the S2 site of DPP 4.
@highlight showed most potent DPP 4 activity with the IC
@highlight value of 1.6nM for DPP 4 and excellent selectivity for DPP 8 9.
@highlight displayed low toxicity toward the LO2 cell line up to 100M.
@highlight robustly improved the glucose tolerance in normal mice.
@highlight exhibited reasonable PK profiles for oral delivery.
