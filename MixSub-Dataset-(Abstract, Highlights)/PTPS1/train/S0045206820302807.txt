 Many peroxisome proliferator activated receptors agonists have been developed for the treatment of metabolic disorders while several PPARs agonists were discontinued in clinical trials because of PPAR related side effects . In order to increase the selectivity against PPAR we performed a structure activity relationship study based on PPAR agonist MHY2013 . These efforts eventually led to the identification of compound

@highlight The novel dual PPAR agonist was identified based on PPAR agonist MHY2013.
@highlight Compound
@highlight exhibited high selectivity against PPAR.
@highlight Compound
@highlight formed multiple interactions with key residues of PPAR and PPAR.
@highlight Compound
@highlight alleviated hepatic steatosis inflammation and fibrosis in the NASH model.
@highlight This study provided promising lead compound to explore better dual PPAR agonists.
