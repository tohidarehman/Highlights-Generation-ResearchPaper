 The development of novel delivery systems capable of enhancing the antibody binding affinity and immunoactivity of short length saccharide antigens is at the forefront of modern medicine . In this regard gold nanoparticles raised great interest as promising nano vaccine platform as they do not interfere with the desired immune response and their surface can be easily functionalized enabling the antigen multivalent presentation . In addition the nanoparticles morphology can have a great impact on their biological properties . Gram positive Group A Streptococcus is a bacterium responsible for many infections and represents a priority healthcare concern but a universal vaccine is still unavailable . Since all the GAS strains have a cell wall characterized by a common polyrhamnose backbone this can be employed as alternative antigen to develop an anti GAS vaccine . Herein we present the synthesis of two oligorhamnoside fragments and their corresponding oligorhamnoside AuNPs designed with two different morphologies . By competitive ELISA we assessed that both symmetric and anisotropic oligorhamnan nanoparticles inhibit the binding of specific polyclonal serum much better than the unconjugated oligosaccharides .
