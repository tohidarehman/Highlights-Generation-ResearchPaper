 Domoic acid the focus of this research is a marine algal neurotoxin and epileptogen produced by species in the genus

@highlight Domoic acid is a common marine neurotoxin and epileptogen.
@highlight Adult macaques were orally exposed to domoic acid near the human regulatory limit.
@highlight Sedated EEGs were administered to monkeys and power was measured.
@highlight Exposed animals had decreased delta power and increased alpha theta beta power.
@highlight Further research is needed to understand functional effects of power changes.
