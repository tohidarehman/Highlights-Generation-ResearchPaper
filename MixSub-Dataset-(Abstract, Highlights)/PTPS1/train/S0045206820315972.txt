 An efficient one flask cascade method for synthesis of the multi substituted 1 2 4 triazoles via chlorotrimethylsilane as a promoter was developed . Firstly nitrilimines were transformed to hydrazonamides as intermediate in high yield by treatment with commercially available hexamethyldisilazane . Subsequently the mixture was added with corresponding acyl chloride and heated in the presence of pyridine to give the corresponding multi substituted 1 2 4 triazoles via chlorotrimethylsilane promoted heterocyclization reaction . The utility of method was demonstrated to synthesize CB
