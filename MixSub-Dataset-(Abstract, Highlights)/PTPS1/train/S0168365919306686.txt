 Protein antigens are in general weakly immunogenic and therefore require co delivery with adjuvants to stimulate potent immune responses . The fusion of peptide antigens to immunostimulatory adjuvants agonists has been demonstrated to greatly improve vaccine potency compared to mixtures of antigen and adjuvant . Chemical approaches to enable the rapid site specific and high yielding linkage of TLR2 ligands to recombinant protein antigens have been previously optimized . These approaches require the use of denaturing conditions to ensure high reaction yields which limits their application as maintenance of native protein folding is necessary to elicit antibodies against conformational epitopes . Here this work aimed to optimize an alternative method to ensure the efficient bioconjugation of TLR2 ligands onto folded protein antigens . An enzyme mediated approach using
