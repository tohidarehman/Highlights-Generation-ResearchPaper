 Telomerase has become one of the new popular targets for the development of anti tumor drugs . Based on the structural characteristics of the BIBR1532 which has entered the stage of clinical research six series total of 64 new compounds with diverse structural characteristics were designed and synthesized . The inhibitory activity against SGC 7901 MGC 803 SMMC 7721 A375 and GES cell lines and their telomerase inhibitory activity were tested . Among them eight compounds showed good activity against cancer cells among them compounds

@highlight New BIBR1532 derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Clear structure activity relationships were summarized.
@highlight Preliminary mechanism as telomerase inhibitor action was discovered.
