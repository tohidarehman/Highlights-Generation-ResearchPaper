 Human scalp hair is a biological matrix that can trap chemical vapours from explosives drugs and chemical weapons . The external contamination of human s hair following exposure to organophosphorus nerve agent was simulated by model compounds triethyl phosphate and diisopropyl fluorophosphate . In this work were exposed strands of hair to vapours of TEP and DFP 3 and 7 ppm

@highlight Scalp hair can be used as a passive sensor able to trap organophosphorous agents.
@highlight Sorption kinetics are best fitted by a bimodal firstorder model.
@highlight Sorption isotherms follow Freundlich model.
@highlight Qualitative and quantitative informations can be expected in the field.
