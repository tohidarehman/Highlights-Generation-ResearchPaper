 Chemotherapy is the standard of care for bladder cancer after transurethral resection of the tumor . However the rapid excretion of clinically used formulations of anticancer drugs make the common intravesical instillation chemotherapy far from efficient . Therefore improving the muco adhesion and penetrability of chemotherapeutic drugs became the key factors in the post surgery treatment of superficial bladder cancers . Here a reduction sensitive vehicle was developed to deliver the reactive oxygen species activated prodrug of gambogic acid for treatment of orthotopic bladder cancer . The positively charged chitosan can significantly enhance the adhesion and permeability of prodrug within the bladder wall . Moreover by utilizing the different glutathione and ROS level between cancer cells and normal cells the dual responsive nanoparticle can selectively and rapidly deliver drug in bladder cancer cells and thus can significantly inhibit the proliferation of bladder cancer cells in an orthotopic superficial bladder cancer model without causing damage to normal cells . This work demonstrates that the smart prodrug nanomedicine may act as a promising drug delivery system for local chemotherapy of bladder cancer with unprecedented clinical benefits .
