 A series of new 3 6 9 trisubstituted acridine derivatives with fluorine substituents on phenyl ring were synthesized and their interaction with calf thymus DNA was investigated . Analysis using UVVis absorbance spectra provided valuable information about the formation of the acridine DNA complex . In addition compounds
