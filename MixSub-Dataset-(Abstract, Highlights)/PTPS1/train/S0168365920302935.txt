 Chemotherapy post cancer surgery has important clinical significance for reducing the chance of recurrent metastasis . However postoperative chemotherapy efficacy is hampered by poor targeting capability and dose limiting toxicity of chemo drugs . Herein we report a bio mimetic platelet membrane cloaked paclitaxel nanocrystal system which consists of spherical paclitaxel nanocrystals as a high dose drug core polyethylene glycol conjugated paclitaxel as an amphiphilic molecule to adjust the surface hydrophilicity of PNCs and the shell of platelet membrane that can target surgical coagulation site . The

@highlight The bio mimetic PPNCs consists of three components drug nanocrystals pegylated paclitaxel and platelet membrane shell.
@highlight PPNCs exhibited uniform particle size distribution high drug loading and good stability.
@highlight PPNCs retained the expression of specific platelet membrane proteins collagen binding capacity with little risk of thrombi.
@highlight PPNCs could target the coagulation site caused by surgery or VDA resulting in better anti tumor effect and improved safety.
