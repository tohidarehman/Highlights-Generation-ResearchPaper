 Organic selenium compounds are widely associated with numerous pharmacological properties . However selenium compounds such as Ebselen and Diphenyl Diselenide could interact with mitochondrial respiratory complexes especially with thiol groups . The present study evaluated whether the insertion of functional groups

@highlight  methoxy and
@highlight  methyl insertion altered the mitochondrial respiratory function.
@highlight Mitochondrial ROS production was reduced by organic selenium compounds except C1.
@highlight  methoxy analogs C2 and C3 did not promote mitochondrial depolarization.
@highlight  methyl compounds showed promising bactericidal properties against
@highlight and MRSA.
@highlight  methyl compounds exhibited antibacterial effects at lower concentrations than
@highlight  methoxy.
