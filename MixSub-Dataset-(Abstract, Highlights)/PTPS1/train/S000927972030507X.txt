 To avoid being preyed organisms must be able to identify predatory threats by sensing molecules released by predators and to employ effective strategies to prevent detection by predators . Furthermore in the wild organisms are also exposed to chemicals that may alter their behavioral traits such as neuroactive pharmaceuticals . Considering the co occurrence of both types of chemicals their possible interaction needs to be studied . To address this topic the aim of this study was to verify the effects of fish kairomone and chlorpromazine isolated and in combination in different functional endpoints of

@highlight Chlorpromazine CPZ and Fish kairomone FK caused functional alteration in
@highlight Feeding rate was decreased in all treatment conditions.
@highlight Oxygen consumption was only affected in the mixture treatment CPZ FK .
@highlight For life history traits and phototactic behavior the effects of FK dominated those of CPZ.
