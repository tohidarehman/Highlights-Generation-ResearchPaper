 In this study the inhibitory activity of young apple polyphenols on glucosidase was investigated . Composition and inhibition analyses suggested that tannic acid epicatechin and phlorizin were the main active constituents in YAP showing glucosidase inhibition . PH was a competitive inhibitor while YAP TA and EC were the mixed type ones . YAP TA PH and EC quenched the fluorescence spectrum of glucosidase significantly . Interestingly the constants that indicate binding interaction between glucosidase and TA PH EC including reciprocal of competitive inhibition constant 1

@highlight Young apple polyphenols YAP are strong glucosidase inhibitors.
@highlight Tannins phlorizin and epicatechin are the main components showing inhibition.
@highlight Phlorizin was competitive but tannic acid or epicatechin were mixed type inhibitors.
@highlight  Glucosidase inhibition by polyphenols was caused by binding interactions.
@highlight Binding of polyphenols with glucosidase caused conformation changes of the enzyme.
