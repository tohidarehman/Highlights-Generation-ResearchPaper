 Modulation of tumor microenvironment has been indicated as an approach to improve efficacy of cancer therapy . Here we proposed a nano co delivery based combination therapy of paclitaxel and silybin which can employ the synergistic effects through chemotherapy sensitization and microenvironment modulation . A dextran based amphiphilic polymer was successfully developed for

@highlight A dextran deoxycholic acid amphiphilic polymer Dex DOCA was successfully synthesized.
@highlight Paclitaxel and silibinin could be co loaded into Dex DOCA at a controlled synergistic ratio.
@highlight  PTX SB NP synchronized the
@highlight biodistribution transport and release of PTX and SB within tumor.
@highlight  PTX SB NP improved intratumoral penetration of drugs by regulating TME.
@highlight  PTX SB NP maximized therapeutic outcomes through chemotherapy sensitization and TME modulation.
