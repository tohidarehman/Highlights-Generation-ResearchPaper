 The Neuropilin family of cell surface receptors have key physiological and pathological functions . Nrp2 is of particular interest due to its involvement in tumor metastasis . Currently peptide and small molecule inhibitors that target Nrp utilize arginine based molecules which have limitations due to high inherent flexibility and issues related to stability . Further there are no known small molecule inhibitors specific for Nrp2 . Recent molecular insights identify a key ligand binding region in the b1 domain of Nrp2 responsible for binding the C terminus of its cognate ligand VEGF C. Based on this we report the discovery of a novel benzamidine based inhibitor that functions through competitive inhibition of VEGF C binding to Nrp2 . Further we have explored inhibitor functionality and selectivity by defining its structureactivity relationship providing valuable insights on this benzamidine based family of Nrp2 inhibitors . This study provides the basis for further development of a potent and specific small molecule inhibitor that competitively targets pathological Nrp2 function .
