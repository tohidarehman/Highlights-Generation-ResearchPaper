 Methylmercury is a neurotoxicant that poses risk to human health and the environment while glutamate homeostasis is necessary for the proper functioning of the brain . We have previously shown an increase in oxidative stress after cockroach exposure to diet containing monosodium glutamate both separately and combined with a low dose of methylmercury . We herein seek to corroborate these findings by quantifying the expression levels of certain antioxidant genes in

@highlight MeHg alone downregulated mRNA levels of
@highlight and
@highlight 5 in experimental cockroaches.
@highlight MeHg MSG upregulated downregulated mRNA levels of
@highlight and
@highlight 5 in exposed cockroaches.
@highlight MeHg NaCl and MeHg MSG upregulated G
@highlight and
@highlight T in cockroaches.
@highlight ICP AES analysis showed an increase in mercury Hg levels in the MeHg treated groups in the heads of cockroaches.
