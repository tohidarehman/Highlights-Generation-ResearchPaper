 Despite a diverse range of active pharmaceutical agents currently at our disposal high morbidity rate diseases continue to pose a major health crisis globally . One of the important parameters in this regard is the controlled cargo delivery at desired sites . Among a variety of synthetic and natural macromolecular systems chitosan an abundant biopolymer offers a platform for tailored architectures that could have high loading capacity of cargo target and deliver . Stimuli directed accumulation of vehicles and drug release is an area of direct relevance to biomedical applications . In this review we highlight essential characteristics of modified chitosan that present themselves for efficient response through an internal and external stimuli . With a brief review of the pertinent properties of chitosan that are relevant to biology the design and critical evaluation of varied chitosan based platforms is discussed . Future directions in exploiting important features of chitosan in this area can be derived from the presented comparative evaluation of the current literature in drug delivery .
