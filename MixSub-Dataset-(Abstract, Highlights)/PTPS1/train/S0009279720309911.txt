 Only in the last decade the long term consequences of sepsis started to be studied and even less attention has been given to the treatment of psychological symptoms of sepsis survivors . It is estimated that 60 of sepsis survivors have psychological disturbances including depression anxiety and cognitive impairment . Although the causative factors remain largely poorly understood blood brain barrier disturbances neuroinflammation and oxidative stress have been investigated . Therefore we sought to explore if the immunomodulatory and antioxidant selenocompound 3 selanyl 1 methyl 1H indole would be able to ameliorate long term behavioral and biochemical alterations in sepsis survivors male

@highlight CMI ameliorated long lasting behavioral alterations in sepsis survivor mice.
@highlight CMI modulated peripheral cell count and oxidative stress in sepsis survivor mice.
@highlight CMI reduced plasma markers of liver and kidney dysfunction induced by sepsis.
@highlight CMI ameliorated BBB dysfunction induced by sepsis.
@highlight CMI reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain of post septic mice.
