 Moenomycin A the well known natural product inhibitor of peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase is a large amphiphilic molecule of molecular mass of 1583g mol and its bioavailablity as a drug is relatively poor . In searching for small molecule ligands with high inhibition ability targeting the enzyme we found that the addition of hydrophobic groups to an isatin based inhibitor of bacterial PGT significantly improves its inhibition against the enzyme as well as its antibacterial activity . The improvement in enzymatic inhibition can be attributed to a better binding of the small molecule inhibitor to the hydrophobic region of the membrane bound bacterial cell wall synthesis enzyme and the plasma membrane . In the present study a total of 20 new amphiphilic compounds were systematically designed and the relationship between molecular hydrophobicity and the antibacterial activity by targeting at PGT was demonstrated . The

@highlight Amphiphilic isatin based inhibitors targeting peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase were synthesized.
@highlight The hydrophobicity of the inhibitors showed significant influence on the inhibition potency.
@highlight The structureactivity relationship of the new isatin based inhibitors was evaluated.
@highlight The isatin based inhibitors showed high potential to be developed as broad spectrum antibiotics.
