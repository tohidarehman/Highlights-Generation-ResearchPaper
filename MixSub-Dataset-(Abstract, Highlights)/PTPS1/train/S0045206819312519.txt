 In order to enhance intracellular uptake and accumulation of therapeutic nucleic acids for improved gene therapy methods numerous delivery vectors have been elaborated . Based on their origin gene carriers are generally classified as viral or non viral vectors . Due to their significantly reduced immunogenicity and highly optimized methods of synthesis nanoparticles constitute a promising alternative for virus based delivery devices . Thus we set out to develop innovative peptide dendrimers for clinical application as transfection agents and gene carriers . In the present work we describe the synthesis of two novel lysine based dendritic macromolecules and their initial characterization for cytotoxicity genotoxicity and transfection potential in two human cell line models cervix adenocarcinoma and microvascular endothelial . This approach allowed us to identify more cationic D3K2 as potent delivery agent being able to increase intracellular accumulation of large nucleic acid molecules such as plasmids . Moreover the dendrimers exhibited specific cytotoxicity towards cancer cell line without showing significant toxic effects on normal cells . These observations are promising prognosis for future clinical application of this type of nanoparticles .
