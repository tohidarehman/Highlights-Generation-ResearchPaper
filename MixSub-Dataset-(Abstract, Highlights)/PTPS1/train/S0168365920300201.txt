 Traditional patches are most successful in transdermal delivery of low dose hydrophobic drugs . Week long transdermal delivery of high dose hydrophilic drugs remains a big challenge . This study explored ablative fractional laser to assist 3 day to week long sustained transdermal delivery of powder hydrophilic drugs in murine models . Bulk drug powder was coated into reservoir patches followed by topical application onto AFL treated skin . Water evaporated from AFL generated skin microchannels gradually dissolve topical drug powder to elicit multi day sustained drug delivery . Using sulforhodamine b zidovudine and bovine serum albumin as model hydrophilic drugs we found tapped coating could coat 1020mg drug per 0.5cm
