 This study synthesizes novel 6 amino 5 cyano 4 aryl 2 mercapto pyrimidines and condensed pyrimidines analogues in order to investigate their potential activity as anticancer agents . The compounds were synthesized via one pot condensation of

@highlight Novel one pot synthesis of new thiopyrimidine analogues were designed using aromatic aldehydes cyano ethyl acetate and thiourea.
@highlight New synthetic thiopyrimidine analogue 8a is able to induce cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in MCF 7 cancer cell line in micromolar concentration.
@highlight The antiproliferative activity of potent synthetic thiopyrimidine analogue is suggested to bind in the active site of phosphodiesterase 4B and 4D and this may help in future screening of inhibition consequences of cAMP or cGMP based biological events.
