 Bromodomain containing protein 4 plays a crucial role in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription and some BRD4 inhibitors have been advanced to clinical trials . Nevertheless the clinical application of BRD4 inhibitors could be limited by drug resistance . As an alternative strategy the emerging Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras technology has the potential to overcome the drug resistance of traditional small molecule drugs . Based on PROTACs approaches several BRD4 degraders were developed and have been proved to degrade BRD4 protein and inhibit tumor growth . Herein we present the design synthesis and biological evaluation of pyrrolopyridone derivative based BRD4 degraders . Four synthesized compounds displayed comparative potence against BRD4 BD1 with IC

@highlight Several BRD4 degraders were designed and synthesized based on pyrrolopyridone derivative.
