 Two novel series of 6 3 cyanopyridine derivatives were designed and synthesized as inhibitors of PIM 1 kinase . Based on cytotoxicity results via MTT assay against prostate carcinoma PC3 human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and breast adenocarcinoma MCF 7 cell lines the most potent cytotoxic cyanopyridine hits

@highlight Synthesized of new 14 6 4 benzamido 4 phthalimido 3 cyanopyridine derivatives.
@highlight Cytotoxicity of all the new derivatives is given and discussed.
@highlight PIM 1 kinase inhibitory activity were evaluated for the most five active derivatives.
@highlight Apoptosis studies and cell cycle analysis were evaluated for the most five active derivatives.
@highlight Molecular modelling of the most active compound with PIM 1 kinase enzyme and
@highlight pharmacokinetic assessment for the most five active derivatives was performed.
