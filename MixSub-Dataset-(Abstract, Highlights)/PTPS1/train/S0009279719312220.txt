 Pregnane X receptor is a ligand activated transcription factor and nuclear receptor expressed ubiquitously along gut liver axis . Inflammatory bowel disorders have been reported to implicate PXR in maintaining tight junction integrity and countering inflammation . However the hepatoprotective role of PXR activation in soothing bacterial translocation in liver cirrhosis has not been explored . Ginkgolide A a terpene trilactone from Ginkgo Biloba extract is a natural ligand of rodent and human PXR . This study aims to investigate the effect of GA in activating PXR and improving associated tight junction integrity and reducing bacterial translocation in gut liver axis of CCl Swiss albino mice were administered with CCl When compared to nave mice In conclusion our data supports the hypothesis that GA treatment to CCl
