 Endovascular therapy in peripheral intervention has grown exponentially in the past decade but the issue of high restenosis rates in lower extremity arteries still persist . While drug coated balloons have been the device of choice recent controversary regarding the long term safety of paclitaxel have raised concern over current DCBs . In our study we proposed that the direct injection of a sirolimus nanoliposomal formulation using a infusion catheter can attenuate inflammation response in injured vessels . In vitro characterization showed retention of the nanoliposomes size and detectable drug amount up to 336days in storage . For in vivo study four female mixed breed swines were subjected to balloon injury of the femoral arteries before treatment with either injection of saline

@highlight The sirolimus nanoliposomes Nanolimus had sustained release up to 28 days.
@highlight Inflammation responses were attenuated in vessels treated with Nanolimus.
@highlight Adventitial Nanolimus injection is a promising non stent non balloon approach to treat restenotic lesions.
