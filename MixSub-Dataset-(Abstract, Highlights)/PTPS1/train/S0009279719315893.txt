 Stroke has been considered the second leading cause of death worldwide and ischemic stroke accounts for the vast majority of stroke cases . Some of the main features of ischemic stroke are increased brain permeability ischemia reperfusion injury oxidative stress and acute inflammation . Antagonism of cysLT1R has been shown to provide cardiovascular and neural benefits . In the present study we investigated the effects of the cysLT1R antagonist zafirlukast both

@highlight Zafirlukast protected against MCAO induced brain infarction and neurological deficit.
@highlight Zafirlukast protected against MCAO induced increase in brain permeability and reduction of occludin and ZO 1.
@highlight Zafirlukast suppressed OGD R induced endothelial monolayer permeability.
@highlight Zafirlukast prevented OGD R induced MMP 2 and MMP 9 expression and NF B activation.
