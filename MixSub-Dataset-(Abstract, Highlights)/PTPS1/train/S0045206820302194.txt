 The G quadruplex forming sequence within the AS1411 derivatives with alternative nucleobases and backbones can improve the chemical and biological properties of AS1411 . Zn phthalocyanine derivatives have potential as high affinity G4 ligands because they have similar size and shape to the G quartets .

@highlight Zn II phthalocyanine derivatives are proposed as ligands of G quadruplex aptamers.
@highlight AS1411 and its derived sequences AT11 L0 and B0 are used to deliver the ligands.
@highlight Docking simulations suggest an end stacking mode of interaction for the ligands.
@highlight ZnPc 4 presented the highest affinity and conformational changes on the G4 structures.
@highlight ZnPc 3 toxicity towards cancer cells was enhanced when complexed with G4 aptamers.
