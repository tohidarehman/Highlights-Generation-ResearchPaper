 A recently reported approach to nanocrystallise encapsulated ciprofloxacin within liposomes has generated increased interest in the solid state properties of drug nanocrystals within liposomal confinement . To explore the potential application of nanocrystallised drug liposomes in oral delivery a liposomal ciprofloxacin formulation was used as a model system . An

@highlight Ciprofloxacin nanocrystallised inside liposomes subjected to intestinal conditions.
@highlight Bile salt interacts with drug to form a bile salt salt of the drug.
@highlight New salt formation depends on bile salt to drug ratio and pH.
@highlight The presence of bile salt in medium alters drug release kinetics.
