 The clinical application of mitoxantrone a DNA intercalating topoisomerase II poison has been largely limited by the risk of secondary tumor and severe myelosuppression . To develop more effective antineoplastic agents with less toxicity a spectrum of anthraquinone analogues of MTZ were herein designed and synthesized based on the concept of enhancing protein backbone binding by rationally introducing hydrophobic long fatty acid chain and hydrophilic polyamine components which are reported to function as effective tumor targeting tethers . The SAR exploration implicated that in our synthesized molecules the introduction of both lipophilic LFC and hydrophilic PA fragment is plausibly beneficial to the anti proliferative potency with a certain degree of selectivity between the hematopoietic and solid malignant cells which still need to be further accurately confirmed . Meanwhile many compounds the LFC tethered
