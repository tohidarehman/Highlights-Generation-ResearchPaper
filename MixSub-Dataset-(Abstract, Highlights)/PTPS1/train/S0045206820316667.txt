 The discovery of the antiproliferative potential of tranilast prompted additional studies directed at understanding the mechanisms of tranilast action . Its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation depends principally on the capacity of tranilast to interfere with transforming growth factor beta signaling . This work summarizes design synthesis and biological evaluation of sixteen novel tranilast analogs on different tumors such as PC 3 HepG 2 and MCF 7 cell lines . The in vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated using MTT assay showed that twelve compounds out of sixteen showed higher cytotoxic activities IC

@highlight Novel series of tranilast analogs is synthesized as potential selective anticancer on PC 3 HepG 2 and MCF 7 cell lines.
@highlight Twelve of the investigated compounds showed more potent cytotoxic agents than 5 FU compound
@highlight displayed amazing anticancer activity 57 times that of reference drug against all the tested cell lines.
@highlight Target compounds
@highlight and
@highlight were the most potent TGFR1 inhibitors showing IC
@highlight s in sub micromolar range IC
@highlight s 0.08 0.09 and 0.19M .
@highlight enhanced apoptosis and arrested G2 M phase of cell cycle. Besides it induced apoptosis via the increase of both caspase 3 level and expression of p53 gene of PC 3 cell.
@highlight Molecular docking of the most potent hits 
@highlight and
@highlight elicited higher affinities to their respective binding site TGFR1 with good binding energies compared to ligand 460 and lead compound tranilast.
