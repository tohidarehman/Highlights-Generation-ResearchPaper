 Increasing evidence shows that long non coding RNAs are closely associated with the development of cancers including triple negative breast cancer . LncRNA FAM201A has been identified as a key regulator in some cancers . However its role has not been explored in TNBC . In this work we investigated the biological role and regulatory mechanism of FAM201A in TNBC . The expression pattern of FAM201A was determined by RT qPCR analysis . The biological effect of FAM201A on cellular process of TNBC was tested using colony formation EdU caspase 3 activity detection flow cytometry wound healing and Transwell assays . ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were performed to verify the interaction between transcription factor 3 and FAM201A . The interaction among FAM201A microRNA 186 5p and tankyrase 1 binding protein 1 was evaluated by luciferase reporter and RIP assays . The results showed that FAM201A expression was significantly upregulated in TNBC tissues and cells . Functionally FAM201A knockdown inhibited TNBC cell proliferation migration and invasion and accelerated cell apoptosis . In mechanism it was confirmed that FAM201A was transcriptionally activated by TCF3 and served as a sponge for miR 186 5p to upregulate TNKS1BP1 expression in TNBC cells . Collectively our study revealed that TCF3 activated FAM201A promoted aggressive phenotypes of TNBC cells by upregulating TNKS1BP1 expression .
