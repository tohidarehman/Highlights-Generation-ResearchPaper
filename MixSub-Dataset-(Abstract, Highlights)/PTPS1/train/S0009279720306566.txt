 Triple negative breast cancer is highly metastatic and lacks effective therapeutic targets among several subtypes of breast cancer . Cancer metastasis promotes the malignancy of TNBC and is closely related to the poor prognosis of the TNBC patients . We aim to explore novel agents that effectively inhibit cancer metastasis to treat TNBC . In our study 2 Methoxy 5seleninyl phenol a CA 4 analogue could inhibit cell motility and invasion in MDA MB 231cells and the mechanism is closely associated to the inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition . Meanwhile SQ significantly inhibited the expression and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in MDA MB 231cells . Moreover the conditioned medium from SQ treated MDA MB 231cells significantly inhibited the motility and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells which was correlated with the inhibition of EMT process in HUVECs . In addition exogenous application of VEGF reversed the occurrence of EMT in HUVECs which stimulated by conditioned medium from SQ treated cells . Furthermore SQ inhibited vasculogenic mimicry formation in MDA MB 231cells which was associated with VE cadherin and EphA2 down regulation . This study indicates that SQ inhibits MDA MB 231cell metastasis through suppressing EMT and VEGF thereby implicating this compound might be a potential therapeutic agent against metastatic TNBC .
