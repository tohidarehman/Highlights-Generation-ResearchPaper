 A series of eight new flavone derivatives containing a piperazine chain with different substitution were synthesized and their structures were determined . Their antiradical and antioxidant activities were evaluated using superoxide anion radical hydroxyl radical 2 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl radical 2 2 azino di radical cation but lower than ascorbic acid BHT doxycycline and medicinal plants . Best antioxidant activities were found for the piperazinyl analogues with methoxy group on phenyl piperazine ring . We suggest that the synthesized compounds may be used as lead molecules for optimization of molecular structure to maximize the antioxidant potency .

@highlight A series of novel piperazinyl flavone derivatives was synthesized.
@highlight Antioxidant activities of the compounds were evaluated using of spectrophotometry ESR and chemiluminescence.
@highlight The antioxidant ability of the piperazinyl flavones was compared with that of standard antioxidants.
