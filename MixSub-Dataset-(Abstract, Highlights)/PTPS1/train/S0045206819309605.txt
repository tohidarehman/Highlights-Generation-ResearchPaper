 Interferons are important glycoproteins which can stimulate or inhibit up to three hundred different genes encoding proteins involved in antiviral defense mechanisms inflammation adaptive immunity angiogenesis and among other processes . Nevertheless different genetic alterations may lead to interferon alpha overproduction in human autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus . As a consequence IFN is a central molecule whose activity must be regulated to block their harmful effect on those disorders where the endogenous cytokine production constitutes the etiology of the illnesses . In this work we evaluate the biological activity of eighty eight compounds from our own chemo library to find potential IFN inhibitors by using a reporter gene assay WISH Mx2 EGFP . We identified some compounds able to modulate negatively the IFN activity . The most active IFN inhibitors were further studied achieving promising results . In addition some combinations of the most active compounds were analyzed accomplishing a stronger effect to decrease the IFN activity than each compound alone . Furthermore the complete inhibition of the cytokine activity was reached with some combinations of compounds .

@highlight A chemo library was screened by a Reporter Gene Assay to find IFN antagonist.
@highlight IFN antagonist compounds belonging to five different chemotypes were identified.
@highlight Flavonoid and furoxan chemotypes exhibited the highest IFN inhibitory response.
@highlight Combination of compounds showed stronger effect to decrease the IFN activity.
@highlight Five compounds appear as potential candidate drugs to treat autoimmune diseases.
