 Matrix metalloproteinases a family of zinc containing endopeptidases involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix make a major contribution to the progression of a vast number of diseases such cancer or epilepsy . Although several MMP inhibitors have been developed to date for the treatment of cancer they have all failed in clinical trials due to lack of efficacy and most importantly the presence of severe side effects . The latter can be explained by their lack of selectivity of these inhibitors . In this regard MMPs family members have a high structural homology which challenge the development of selective inhibitors for a specific MMP . Here we have used

@highlight calculations used to design selective MMP 9 and MMP 2 inhibitors.
@highlight tools to design inhibitors with the capacity to cross the blood brain barrier.
@highlight Candidate obtained with the potential to attenuate the development of epilepsy.
