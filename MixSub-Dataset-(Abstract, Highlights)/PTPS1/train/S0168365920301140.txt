 Motile bacteria are able to penetrate in the distal areas of blood vessel which makes bacteria attractive to researchers as a drug delivery vehicle carrying anti cancer drugs to tumors . Not only therapeutic bacteria show wide anti tumor effect but also the combination of therapeutic bacteria and conventional chemotherapy leads to dramatically large synergetic effect . We provide a mechanistic understanding of enhanced drug delivery in tumors by co administration of chemotherapeutic agents and therapeutic bacteria . In this work simultaneous delivery of

@highlight Delivery of anti cancer agents and therapeutic bacteria in tumors is mathematically modeled.
