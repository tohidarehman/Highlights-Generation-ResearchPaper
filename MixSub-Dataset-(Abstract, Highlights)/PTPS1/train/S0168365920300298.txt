 As the most common malignancy in women breast cancer causes 40 000 deaths annually . Ribonuclease A a new anti cancer agent has attracted intense interest due to its high efficacy and specificity . However RNase suffers from instability a short half life in the circulation and poor membrane penetration . To overcome these challenges we designed a supramolecular nanogel for the cytosolic delivery of RNase . The nanogels were fabricated using hostguest interactions between azobenzene and cyclodextrin conjugated to poly

@highlight Supramolecular nanogels were fabricated using hostguest interactions between azobenzene and cyclodextrin.
@highlight Protein could be loaded inside the nanogels in mild aqueous conditions though a direct mixing method.
@highlight RNase could release from nanogels in hypoxia suggesting the potential for tumor selective drug delivery.
