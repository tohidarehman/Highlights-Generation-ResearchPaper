 In spite of progress in understanding biology of glioblastoma this tumor remains incurable with a median survival rate of 15months . Previous studies have shown that 2 5 1 3 4 thiadiazole and 2 5 1 3 4 thiadiazole diminished viability of cancer cell lines of different origin . In the current study we have examined activity of these compounds in several GBM cell lines and patient derived GBM cells . We have also designed synthesized and evaluated anti GBM activity of novel 1 3 4 thiadiazole derivatives containing additional

@highlight Anti glioblastoma activity of new 1 3 4 thiadiazole derivatives was investigated.
@highlight All compounds were 15110 times more potent than temozolomide.
@highlight FPDT displayed the IC
@highlight value of 4568M for GBM cells and 100M for astrocytes.
@highlight Anti glioblastoma activity of FPDT is linked to downregulation of the AKT pathway.
