 Methods to selectively destroy mitochondria of tumor cells and induce cell apoptosis with nanomedicine constitute challenges in cancer therapy . In the present study we develop cell membrane mitochondria dual targeting and pH redox dual responsive nanoparticles for mitochondrion therapy . The nanoparticles are fabricated by the self assembly of triphenylphosphonium grafted poly poly d

@highlight The nanocarriers have a long blood circulation time and enhanced internalization of tumor cells.
@highlight The micelles can target and anchor into mitochondrial outer membrane thereby inducing the depolarization of membrane.
@highlight The released DOX can directly diffuse into the mitochondria thereby resulting in mitochondrial DNA damage.
