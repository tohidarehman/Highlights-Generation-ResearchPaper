 In experimental animals inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase reduces the gastrointestinal damage produced by non steroidal anti inflammatory agents that act by inhibition of cyclooxygenase . This suggests that compounds able to inhibit both enzymes may be potentially useful therapeutic agents . In the present study we have investigated eight novel amide analogues of carprofen ketoprofen and fenoprofen as potential FAAH COX dual action inhibitors .

@highlight New profen amides were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Profen amides were tested as FAAH and COX inhibitors.
@highlight Some Carprofen amides show high activity against FAAH.
@highlight Some Carprofen amides potent are inhibitors of human recombinant COX 2.
@highlight Some Carprofen amides are dual acting FAAH substrate selective COX inhibitors representing leads.
