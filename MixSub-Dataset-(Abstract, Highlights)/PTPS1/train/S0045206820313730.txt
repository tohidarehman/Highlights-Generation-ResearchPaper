 A new series of derivatives characterized by the presence of the 3 4 5 trimethoxylbenzamide substituted benzofurans were synthesized and evaluated for antiproliferative activity against four cancer cell lines and one normal human cell line . Among them derivative

@highlight A series of novel 3 4 5 trimethoxylbenzamide substituted benzofurans were prepared.
@highlight possessed potent antiproliferative activity on MDA MB 231 HCT 116 and HT 29.
@highlight induced HeLa cells arrest in G2 M phase and inhibited tubulin polymerization.
