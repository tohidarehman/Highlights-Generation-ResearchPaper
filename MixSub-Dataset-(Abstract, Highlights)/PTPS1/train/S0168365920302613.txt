 Therapeutic goals for rheumatoid arthritis consist of inhibiting the inflammatory response and repairing the damaged bone cartilage . Tissue engineering could achieve both goals however it was hindered due to the lack of biologically relevant tissue complexity limitation in covering the entire polyarthritis lesions and requirement of extra surgical implantation . Integrating nanotechnologies into clinically sized implants represents a major opportunity to overcome these problems . Herein we designed a sialic acid modified chitosan oligosaccharide based biphasic calcium phosphate a biomimetic nanoplatform that could load with methotrexate . We found that SA modification could not only improve the accumulation of the designed organicinorganic nanoplatform in arthritic paws but also cooperate with BCP to exert synergetic mineralization of calcium phosphate allowing more osteoblasts to attach proliferate and differentiate . The more differentiated osteoblasts produced 4.46 fold type I collagen and 2.60 fold osteoprotegerin compared to the control group . Besides the disassembled nanorods released chitosan oligosaccharide based micelles revealing a cartilage protective effect by reducing the loss of glycosaminoglycan . All these improvements contributed to the light inflammatory response and reduced destruction on cartilage bone . The findings provide a novel strategy for RA therapy
