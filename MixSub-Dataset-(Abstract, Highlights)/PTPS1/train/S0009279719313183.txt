 Alcoholism synergizes the development of the hepatocellular carcinoma in patients infected with hepatitis B or C virus . Tumor initiating stem like cells are refractory to therapy and have expression of stemness transcription factors . Leaky gut derived endotoxin stimulates TLR4 NANOG pathway that skews asymmetric cell division and that metabolically reprograms hepatocytes liver progenitor cells leading to self renewal . TICs isolated from mouse HCC models or human HCCs are tumorigenic and have p53 degradation via phosphorylation of the protective protein NUMB and its dissociation from p53 by the oncofetal protein TBC1D15 . Furthermore dysregulation of lncRNA promotes genesis of TICs leading to HCC development . This review describes roles of cell fate decision metabolic reprogramming and lncRNA for TIC genesis and liver oncogenesis . This project was supported by NIH grants 1R01AA018857 01 5R21AA025470 P50AA11999 R24AA012885 and pilot project funding .
