 A new series of triazolopyrimidines and thiazolopyrimidine hydrobromides was designed and prepared as topoisomerase II inhibitors . Screening of all synthesized compounds was carried out by the National Cancer Institute of USA . Activity against 60 human cancer cell lines representing different cancer types was determined . Accordingly compound

@highlight New series of fused pyrimidines was designed as topoisomerase II inhibitors.
@highlight Compound
@highlight was the most potent inhibitor especially against the renal cell line A498 with IC
@highlight  3.5M.
@highlight Thiazolopyrimidine
@highlight showed potent topoisomerase II inhibitory activity IC
@highlight 2.89M .
@highlight Docking study was performed and binding interactions of compound
@highlight in the binding site of topoisomerase II enzyme rationalizing the significant inhibitory activity of this derivative.
