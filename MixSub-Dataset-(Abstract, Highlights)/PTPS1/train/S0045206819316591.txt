 Bacterial DNA gyrase is an important target for the development of novel antibacterial drugs which are urgently needed because of high level of antibiotic resistance worldwide . We designed and synthesized new 4 5 6 7 tetrahydrobenzo

@highlight Siderophore mimics were conjugated with 4 5 6 7 tetrahydrobenzo 
@highlight  thiazole based DNA gyrase B inhibitors.
@highlight The most potent conjugate had an IC
@highlight of 58nM against
@highlight DNA gyrase.
@highlight Two conjugates displayed MICs of 14g mL against
@highlight tolC strain.
@highlight Most conjugates showed improved activities against wild type
@highlight in iron depleted medium.
