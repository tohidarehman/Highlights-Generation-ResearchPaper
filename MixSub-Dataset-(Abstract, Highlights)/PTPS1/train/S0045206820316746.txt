 Quorum sensing a common cell to cell communication system is considered to have promising application in antibacterial therapy since they are expected to induce lower bacterial resistance than conventional antibiotics . However most of present quorum sensing inhibitors have potent cell toxicity which limits their application . In this study we evaluated the diverse quorum sensing inhibition activities of different biaromatic furanones and brominated pyrrolones . On this basis we further designed and synthesized a new series of aryl substituted pyrrolones

@highlight A novel series of aryl substituted pyrrolidone were designed and synthesized.
@highlight They were evaluated as quorum sensing inhibitors against
@highlight Compound
@highlight inhibited the pyocyanin production and protease activity by 80.6 and 78.5 respectively.
@highlight Compound
@highlight is worth further investigation as a quorum sensing inhibitor.
