 Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and devastating type of primary brain cancer . Despite surgery and chemo radiation therapy recurrence often takes place and leads to patient death . We report here on the development of a camptothecin based self assembling prodrug hydrogel that can be used as an adjunct therapy for local treatment of GBM following maximal tumor resection . When dispersed in aqueous solution the designed CPT prodrug spontaneously assembles into supramolecular filaments with a 100 CPT loading . In both

@highlight Conjugation of camptothecin to a peptide creates a self formulating prodrug hydrogelator.
@highlight The prodrug hydrogel can release therapeutics over a long period of time.
@highlight The prodrug hydrogel extends survival in a glioblastoma resection and recurrence model.
