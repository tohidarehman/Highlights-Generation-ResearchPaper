 Immunotherapy has exhibited great potential in cancer treatment . However for immunosuppressive tumors such as pancreatic cancer immunotherapy is far from satisfactory . PI3K and colony stimulating factor 1 colony stimulating factor 1 receptor pathways are involved in the infiltration and polarization of immunosuppressive cells including M2 tumor associated macrophages causing a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment in pancreatic cancer . Herein a M2 TAM targeting nanomicelle was developed to co deliver PI3K inhibitor NVP BEZ 235 and CSF 1R siRNA for specific TAMs reprogramming and antitumor immune responses activation . M2 TAM targeting peptide M2pep was modified on a mixed micelle which was potent to co encapsulate BEZ 235 and CSF 1R siRNA . The formulated nanomicelle increased M2 TAM targeting efficiency both

@highlight M2pep modified mixed micelle specifically targeted M2 polarized TAM.
@highlight CSF 1R siRNA and BEZ 235 were successfully co encapsulated in M2pep MM.
@highlight Inhibition of PI3k and CSF 1R pathways repolarized TAM from M2 to M1 subtype.
@highlight Inhibition of PI3k and CSF 1R reduced the tumor infiltration of MDSCs.
