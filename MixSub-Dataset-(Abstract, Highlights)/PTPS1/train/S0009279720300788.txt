 Oxidative stress induced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells contributes to the development and progression of glaucoma . Sestrin2 a stress inducible protein has a potent antioxidant capacity that can provide cytoprotection against various noxious stimuli . However whether Sesn2 is involved in protecting RGCs from oxidative stress remains unexplored . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of Sesn2 in regulating hydrogen peroxide H

@highlight Sesn2 expression is induced by in H
@highlight exposure in RGCs.
@highlight Sesn2 overexpression alleviated H
@highlight  induced injury in RGCs.
@highlight Sesn2 enhances Nrf2 activation by inhibiting Keap1.
@highlight Sesn2 exerts cytoprotective effect by enhancing Nrf2 activation.
