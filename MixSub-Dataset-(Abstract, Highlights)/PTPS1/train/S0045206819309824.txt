 Sosn . is an endemic plant species and it belongs to Asteraceae family . It is distributed widely in the Central and East Anatolia . This study was carried out for evaluation of the antioxidant activity enzyme inhibition effect elemental and phenolic content of Acetylcholinesterase butyrylcholinesterase glycosidase and glutathione s transferase enzymes have crucial functions on metabolism . Enzyme inhibition or activation mostly attributed to some health disorders such as Alzheimers disease Diabetes mellitus cancer and hyperglycemia . Phenolic contents are responsible for effective biological activity . This study evaluated the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of
