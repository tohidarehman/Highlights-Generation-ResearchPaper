 Gene therapy has gathered vast interest and been proved promising and prospective . While gene therapy evolves fast demands of high transfecting efficiency and less toxic gene vectors are not sufficiently fulfilled . The progression of materials is doing the favor from which therapeutic application benefited is helping reshape treatments of cancer . In this work we synthesized fluorinated branched polyethylenimine PF

@highlight RRPHC nanoparticle helps escape from lysosome and deliver gene into nucleus.
@highlight The nanoparticle possesses a relatively high transfection efficiency on A549 cells.
@highlight Transfected cells secrete transmembrane SP TAT Apoptin to kill neighbor cells.
