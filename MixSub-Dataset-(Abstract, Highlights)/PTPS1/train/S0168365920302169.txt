 Oral drug administration is one of the most preferred and simplest routes among both patients and formulation scientists . Nevertheless orally delivery of some of the most widely used therapeutic agents is still a major challenge due to the limited oral bioavailability associated with them . The poor oral bioavailability of such drugs is attributed to one or many factors such as poor aqueous solubility poor permeability and enzymatic degradation . Various technological strategies have been developed to enhance the bioavailability of these drugs after oral administration . Among the different approaches advanced and innovative drug delivery systems especially targeting based strategies have garnered tremendous attention . Furthermore the presence of numerous types of cells and solute carrier transporters throughout the gastrointestinal tract represents numerous potential targeting sites for successful oral delivery that have not yet been exploited for their full potential . This review describes different targeting strategies towards different targeting sites in the gastrointestinal tract . Additionally exciting improvements in oral drug delivery systems with different targeting strategies are also discussed .

@highlight Targeting based drug delivery systems are promising strategies to improve the oral bioavailability of drugs or biologics
@highlight Receptors and transporters expressed on the surface of intestinal cells have been exploited as targets for oral drug delivery
@highlight Modifying the physicochemical properties of the drug delivery system might be a new trend to develop targeted delivery systems
@highlight The optimal physicochemical properties of the drug delivery system would vary depending on the cell transporter being targeted
