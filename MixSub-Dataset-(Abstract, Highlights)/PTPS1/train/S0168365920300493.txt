 Inducible T cell costimulator upon binding to its ligand mediates adaptive immunity and antitumor response . Thus antitumor therapies targeting the ICOS ICOSL pathway hold great promise for cancer treatment . In this regard ICOSL triggering by a soluble recombinant form of ICOS hampered adhesiveness and migration of dendritic endothelial and tumor cells

@highlight  cyclodextrin nanosponges work as a Trojan horse for cell delivery of ICOS Fc.
@highlight Nanoparticle incorporation enables the ICOS Fc capability in reducing tumor growth.
@highlight ICOS Fc loaded nanosponges trigger an anticancer immune response in melanoma model.
