 We examined whether active fruit naringin can reduce the risk of BPA mediated neurotoxicity in L NAME induced hypertensive rats and whether the modulation could be linked to improvement of brain NO signaling . Male albino rats were randomly distributed into eight groups . Group I was control animals Group II was orally treated with L NAME Group III was orally treated with 100 mg kg BPA Group IV was orally treated with L NAME 100 mg kg BPA . Group V was orally administered with L NAME 80 mg kg NAR . Group VI was orally administered with 100 mg kg BPA 80 mg kg NAR . Group VII was orally administered with L NAME 100 mg kg BPA 80 mg kg NAR . Lastly group VIII was orally treated with 80 mg kg NAR . The treatment lasted for 14 days . Sub acute exposure to L NAME and BPA induced hypertension and mediated neuroinflammation at CA 2 and CA 4 of hippocampus cells . It was evident by increase in PDE 5
