 Diabetes is a ubiquitously a metabolic disorder and life threatening disease . Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors belong to the class of nuclear receptors which acts as transcription factors to regulate lipid and glucose metabolism . PPAR alpha gamma dual agonists tend to corroborate the functions of both thiazolidinediones and fibrates and they hold substantial promise for ameliorating the type 2 diabetic treatments and providing potential therapeutic diabetic interventions . New 1 2 4 oxadiazole based

@highlight A series of 1 2 4 oxadiazole derivative were synthesized.
@highlight AutoDock Vina showed better binding affinity to PPAR alpha and gamma receptor.
@highlight ADME properties predicted to be non carcinogenicity and non mutagenicity.
@highlight 9n and 9a were found to be most potent on PPAR alpha and gamma receptors as dual agonist.
@highlight evaluation found to reduce the plasma glucose level and total cholesterol level significantly.
