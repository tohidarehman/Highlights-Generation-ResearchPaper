 We investigate the encapsulation in hybridosomes a type of capsules unique regarding their structure and method of elaboration . Hybridosomes are made of a single shell of inorganic nanoparticles crosslinked with a polymer and are easily obtained

@highlight The Ouzo effect enables high loading of Hybridosomes hybrid capsule .
@highlight The cargo is nanoprecipitated within the core of Hybridosomes.
@highlight The cargo is released to the body while the capsule is captured by the macrophages.
