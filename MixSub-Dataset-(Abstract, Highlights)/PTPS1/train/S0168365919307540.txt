 Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer with one of the fastest increasing incidence rates among solid tumors . The use of checkpoint inhibitors has recently emerged as a viable alternative to conventional modes of therapy . However increasing evidence points towards the need for a tumor priming step to improve intratumoral immune cell infiltration . IL 12 is an immune activating cytokine with such potential and was explored in earlier clinical trials as a highly concentrated systemic infusion . This unfortunately led to severe adverse effects . From this perspective the localization and gradual release of such a potent immunotherapeutic agent in the tumor microenvironment is desired . This manuscript reports the use of a heparin based complex coacervate to deliver IL 12 in which heparin binding motifs on IL 12 allow for its effective encapsulation . IL 12 encapsulated complex coacervates significantly improved the bioactivity of IL 12 and provided protection from proteolytic cleavage in vitro . Indeed a single injection of IL 12 coacervate significantly inhibits the in vivo growth of treated and untreated contralateral tumor growth in a syngeneic B16F10 mouse melanoma model . Furthermore tumors in mice receiving IL 12 complex coacervate treatment displayed increased infiltration by natural killer cells and CD8

@highlight First to demonstrate complex coacervate mediated protein delivery for cancer.
@highlight Complex coacervates protect enhance bioactivity of immunostimulatory protein IL 12.
@highlight Single injection of IL 12 coacervate systemically inhibits tumor growth in vivo.
