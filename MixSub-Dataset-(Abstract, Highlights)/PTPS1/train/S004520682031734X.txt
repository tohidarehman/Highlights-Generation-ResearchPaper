 Given that lactam antibiotic resistance mediated by metallo lactamases seriously threatens human health we designed and synthesized nineteen hydroxamic acids with benzenesulfonamide which exhibited broad spectrum inhibition against four tested MLs ImiS L1 VIM 2 and IMP 1 except

@highlight Hydroxamic acids with benzenesulfonamide are reversible competitive broad spectrum MLs inhibitor.
@highlight Hydroxamic acid combined with antibiotics have synergistic antibacterial effect
@highlight and
@highlight Hydroxamic acid inhibits MLs by binding to Zn ions at active sites.
