 Indole benzimidazoles have recently gained attention due to their antiproliferative and antiestrogenic effects . However their structural similarities and molecular mechanisms shared with selective estrogen receptor modulators have not yet been investigated . In this study we synthesized novel ethylsulfonyl indole benzimidazole derivatives by substituting the first R
