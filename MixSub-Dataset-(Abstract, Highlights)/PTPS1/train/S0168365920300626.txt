 Small diameter artificial vascular grafts modified with layer by layer coating show promise in reducing the failure caused by thrombosis and inflammation but undesirable stability and bioactivity issues of the coating and payload usually limits their long term efficacy . Herein inspired by catechol gallol surface chemistry a sandwiched layer by layer coating constructed by polyethyleneimine and heparin with the embedding of epigallocatechin gallate dexamethasone combination was used to modify the electrospun polycaprolactone vascular grafts . Polyphenol embedding endowed the coating with abundant intermolecular interactions between each coating components mainly contributed by the stacking weak intermolecular cross linking and enriched hydrogen bonding which further enhanced the coating stability and also supported the sustained release of the payloads like polyelectrolytes and drugs . Compared with the conventional LBL coating the loading amounts of heparin and dexamethasone in the EGCG embedded LBL coatings doubled and the drug release could be significantly prolonged without serious initial burst . The

@highlight Sandwiched LBL coating was sequentially assembled by PEI EGCG DEX and heparin.
@highlight EGCG enriched intermolecular interactions to enhance the coating stability.
@highlight Sandwiched LBL coating performed sustained payloads release behavior.
