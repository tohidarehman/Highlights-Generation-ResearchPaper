 Continuing our studies aimed at A ring modified vitamin D compounds we designed novel 19 norcalcitriol derivatives bearing at C 2 pegylated chains of different lengths . The terminal fragments of these substituents contain hydroxyls or moieties possessing nitrogen and or sulfur atoms capable of transition metal ions complexation . Also two conjugatetype platinum complexes of 19 norcalcitriol were obtained in which

@highlight Series of 19 norcalcitriol analogs with pegylated 2 alkylidene groups were synthesized.
@highlight Pt II complexes of two vitamin D analogs were obtained and biologically tested.
@highlight Cytotoxic activity of the synthesized 19 norcalcitriol analogs was assessed.
