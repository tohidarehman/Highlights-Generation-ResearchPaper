 Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease with a drastically growing worldwide prevalence . It is usually associated with numerous complications of which diabetic nephropathy is a main complication of microvasculature and more seriously a common cause of end stage renal disease . Unfortunately both the lack of a definitive remedy alongside the economic and the social burden on DN patients enforces considerable impetus for developing alternative therapies . IL 33 is a newly discovered member of the IL 1 cytokine family . IL33 ST2 signaling plays a crucial role in acute and chronic kidney diseases . Calycosin is an isoflavone with reported IL33 signaling inhibitory activity . The present study aimed to investigate if calycosin possess renal protective effect in high fat diet STZ induced T2DM model and to clarify the potential underlying mechanisms . HFD STZ control rats showed functional and structural renal damage confirmed by increased serum creatinine blood urea nitrogen and albuminuria associated with marked renal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis . Initiation of inflammation oxidative stress and fibrosis was evident as depicted by elevated renal levels of IL33 ST2 mRNA as well as increased renal NF Bp65 TNF IL 1 MDA and TGF contents with suppressed Nrf2 and TAC . Calycosin treatment markedly improved the aforementioned makers of renal injury and dysfunction modulated IL33 ST2 signaling inflammatory cytokines oxidative stress and fibrotic processes . This was accompanied by improvement of T2DM induced renal ultramicroscopic and histopathological alterations .

@highlight IL33 ST2 signaling is activated in T2DM induced renal injury.
@highlight IL33 ST2 axis is associated with inflammation and fibrosis in diabetic kidney.
@highlight Calycosin treatment preserved renal structure and function in diabetic rats.
