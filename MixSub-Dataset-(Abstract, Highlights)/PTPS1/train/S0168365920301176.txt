 The application of nanotechnology in medicine has the potential to make a great impact on human health ranging from prevention to diagnosis and treatment of disease . The kidneys are the main organ of the human urinary system responsible for filtering the blood and concentrating metabolic waste into urine by means of the renal glomerulus . The glomerular filtration apparatus presents a barrier against therapeutic agents based on charge and or molecular size . Therefore drug delivery to the kidneys faces significant difficulties resulting in treatment failure in several renal disorders . Accordingly different strategies have recently being explored for enhancing the delivery of therapeutic agents across the filtration barrier of the glomerulus . Nanosystems with different physicochemical properties including size shape surface charge and possessing biological features such as high cellular internalization low cytotoxicity controllable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution have shown promising results for renal therapy . Different types of nanoparticles have been used to deliver drugs to the kidney . In this review we discuss nanotechnology based drug delivery approaches for acute kidney injury chronic kidney disease renal fibrosis renovascular hypertension and kidney cancer .

@highlight Drug delivery using nanotechnology is a novel promising strategy in therapeutic medicine.
@highlight Nano based delivery systems targeting kidney have been employed to treat kidney diseases.
@highlight The properties of drug delivery systems are dependent on the physio chemical features of nano particles.
@highlight Among most important nano based materials used for drug delivering to kidney are polymeric NPs.
