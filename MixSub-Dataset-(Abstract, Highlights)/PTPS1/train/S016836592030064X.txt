 As a chronic inflammatory disease periodontitis is responsible for irreversible soft tissue damage and severe alveolar bone resorption . However curative effects of current therapies are largely confined by the difficulty to simultaneously achieve anti inflammation and bone regeneration . Also the dynamic environment in oral cavity easily causes the drugs swallowed or rinsed away by saliva . We report here a one step treatment based on a core shell nanofiber membrane fabricated by coaxial electrospinning . Polymeric micelles containing SP600125 were distributed in the shell while BMP 2 was incorporated in the core . After crosslinking the nanofiber membrane displayed a prolonged degradation and release period up to 4weeks . The release of SP600125 was detected at beginning whereas BMP 2 was not released until day 12 . Such a time programmed release behavior was proved desirable for suppressing the expression of pro inflammatory factors and enhancing the osteogenic induction

@highlight A micelle in nanofiber membrane was fabricated for the one step treatment of periodontitis.
@highlight The core shell structure endowed the membrane with a time programmed drug release property.
@highlight The membrane exhibited excellent anti inflammatory and pro osteogenic propertie
@highlight It also possessed excellent curative effects on beagle s class II furcation model.
