 Alcoholic liver disease is a progressively aggravated liver disease with high incidence in alcoholics . Ethanol induced fat accumulation and the subsequent lipopolysaccharide driven inflammation bring liver from reversible steatosis to irreversible hepatitis fibrosis cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma . Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand activated transcription factors and plays pivotal roles in the regulation of fatty acid homeostasis as well as the inflammation control in the liver . It has been well documented that PPAR activity and or expression are downregulated in liver of mice exposed to ethanol which is thought to be one of the prime contributors to ethanol induced steatosis hepatitis and fibrosis . This article summarizes the current evidences from

@highlight PPAR plays pivotal roles in regulation of fatty acid homeostasis in liver.
@highlight PPAR activity and or expression in liver is downregulated after ethanol exposure.
@highlight The expression of PPAR in human liver may be similar to that in mice liver.
@highlight PPAR expression is decreased in the liver of patients with NAFLD.
