 Organophosphates are widely used as pesticides and have been employed as warfare agents . OPs inhibit acetylcholinesterase leading to over stimulation of cholinergic synapses and can cause status epilepticus . OPs poisoning can result in irreversible brain damage and death . Despite termination of SE recurrent seizures and abnormal brain activity remain common sequelae often associated with long term neural damage and cognitive dysfunction . Therefore early treatment for prevention of seizures is of high interest . Using a rat model of paraoxon poisoning we tested the efficacy of different neuroprotective and anti epileptic drugs in suppressing early seizures and preventing brain damage . Electrocorticographic recordings were performed prior during and after injection of 4.5 LD

@highlight Combination of anti epileptics and midazolam promotes status epilepticus cessation.
@highlight Midazolam plus valproate significantly shortened seizure duration and recurrence.
@highlight Status epilepticus duration was not associated with the degree of late brain injury.
@highlight Isoflurane significantly reduced late brain injury compared to other agents tested.
