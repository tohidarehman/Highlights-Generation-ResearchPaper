 Endocrine therapies targeting estrogen action are effective in decreasing mortality of breast cancer . However their efficacy is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance . Our previous study demonstrated that overexpression of a histone methyltransferase NSD2 drives tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells and that NSD2 is a potential biomarker of tamoxifen resistant breast cancer . Here we found that DZNep an indirect inhibitor of histone methyltransferases potently induces the degradation of NSD2 protein and inhibits the expression of NSD2 target genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway . DZNep treatment of tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells and xenograft tumors also strongly inhibits tumor growth and the cancer cell survival through decreasing cell production of NADPH and glutathione and invoking elevated ROS to cause apoptosis . These findings suggest that DZNep like agents can be developed to target NSD2 histone methyltransferase for effective treatment of tamoxifen resistant breast cancer .
