 Irinotecan is widely prescribed for treatment of various intractable cancers such as advanced and metastatic colon cancer cells but its continuous treatment promotes the resistance development . In this study we established CPT11 resistant variants of three human colon cancer cell lines and found that gain of the resistance elicited an up regulation of aldo keto reductase 1C3 in the cells . Additionally the sensitivity to CPT11 toxicity was decreased and increased by overexpression and knockdown respectively of the enzyme . Moreover the resistant cells suppressed formation of reactive 4 hydroxy 2 nonenal by CPT11 treatment and the suppressive effect was almost completely abolished by addition of an AKR1C3 inhibitor . These results suggest that up regulated AKR1C3 contributes to promotion of the chemoresistance by detoxifying the reactive aldehyde . Western blot and real time polymerase chain reaction analyses and ATP binding cassette B1 functional assay revealed that among three ABC transporters ABCB1 was the most highly up regulated by development of the CPT11 resistance inferring a significant contribution of pregnane X receptor dependent signaling to the ABCB1 up regulation . The combined treatment with inhibitors of AKR1C3 and ABCB1 potently sensitized the resistant cells to CPT11 and its active metabolite SN38 . Taken together our results suggest that combination of AKR1C3 and ABCB1 inhibitors is effective as adjuvant therapy to enhance CPT11 sensitivity of intractable colon cancer cells .
