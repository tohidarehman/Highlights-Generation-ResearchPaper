 Doxorubicin administration decreases cardiac soluble guanylate cyclase activity . We hypothesized that bypassing impaired NO sGC cGMP pathway resulting from the activation of oxidized and heme free soluble guanylate cyclase could be a therapeutic target for DOX mediated cardiomyopathy . The present study investigated the therapeutic roles and mechanism of BAY60 2770 an activator of oxidized sGC in alleviating DOX CM . H9c2 cardiomyocytes were pretreated with BAY60 2770 followed by DOX . Cell viability and intracellular reactive oxygen species were subsequently measured . To determine the role BAY60 2770 in mitochondrial ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential we examined mitoSOX RED and TMRE fluorescence under DOX exposure . As animal experiments rats were orally administered with 5mg kg of BAY60 2770at 1h prior to every DOX treatment and then assessed by echocardiography and apoptotic marker and autophagy . BAY60 2770 ameliorated cell viability and DOX induced oxidative stress in H9c2 cells which was mediated by PKG activation . Mitochondrial ROS and TMRE fluorescence were attenuated by BAY60 2770 in DOX treated H9c2 cells . DOX induced caspase 3 activation decreased after pretreatment with BAY60 2770 BAY60 2770 appears to mitigate DOX induced mitochondrial ROS membrane potential loss autophagy and subsequent apoptosis leading to protection of myocardial injury and dysfunction . These novel results highlighted the therapeutic potential of BAY60 2770 in preventing DOX CM .
