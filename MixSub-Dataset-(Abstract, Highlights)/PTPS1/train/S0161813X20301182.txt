 Methylmercury is an environmental neurotoxicant known to disrupt behavior related to dopamine neurotransmission in experimental models . Such disruptions are sensitive to dopamine agonists when administered acutely after exposure to MeHg has ended or when administered concurrently with MeHg exposure . Sustained attention and short term remembering components of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are partially mediated by dopamine neurotransmission . In order to observe MeHg related alterations in sustained attention and short term memory as well as determine sensitivity of MeHg exposed animals to dopamine agonists commonly used in the treatment of ADHD symptoms rats were exposed to 0 0.5 or 5 ppm MeHg throughout adolescence and trained in a hybrid sustained attention short term memory visual signal detection task in adulthood . Behavior was then probed with acute

@highlight Adolescence is a sensitive period for methylmercury toxicity with impacts on motor activity perseveration and reinforcement processing.
@highlight Acute
@highlight  amphetamine was observed to produce dose dependent inhibition of attention and memory.
@highlight Acute
@highlight  amphetamine was shown to produce methylmercury related baseline dependent responding.
