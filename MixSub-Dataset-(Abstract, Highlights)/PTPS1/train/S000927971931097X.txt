 Cyclo peptide CLP is a marine natural metabolite and well recognized as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent with limited studies on anticancer activity . The current study aims to determine the effect of CLP on migration and growth of triple negative breast cancer cell lines . The anti growth potential was evaluated by MTT BrdU and TUNEL assays DNA damage by H2AX and Dead green assays antimigration activity by Boyden chamber invasion and wound healing assays . Interaction of CLP with CD151 was resolved by PatchDock . Effect of CLP on the expression of transmembrane CD151 was evaluated by cell based ELISA assay . The interaction between CD151 and EGFR was predicted by using FireDoc Web server . Impact of CLP on the interaction of CD151 with EGFR was evaluated by co immunoprecipitation assay . The effect of CLP on the cell cycle and its controlling proteins was determined by Western blotting . CLP reduced the viability of MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 TNBC cell lines but not human breast healthy epithelial cell line similar to eribulin standard . CLP also inhibited proliferation cell cycle and migration . It induced DNA strand breaks DNA damage and cell death . It showed the most favorable interactions with CD151 in

@highlight Cyclo L Leucyl L Prolyl treatment induced cytotoxicity and reduced the viability of triple negative breast cancer cells.
@highlight It also induced the DNA damage and apoptosis in TNBC cells.
@highlight It inhibited migration and proliferation of TNBC cells.
@highlight It reduced the cell surface expression of CD151 and its interaction with EGFR.
@highlight It attenuated the cell cycle of TNBC cells by reducing cyclin D1 CDK4 PAK Rac1 and p27kip1 expression.
