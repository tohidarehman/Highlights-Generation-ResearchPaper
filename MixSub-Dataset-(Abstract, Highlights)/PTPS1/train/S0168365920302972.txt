 Focused ultrasound is a minimally invasive technology used for treatment of many diseases including diseases related to the colon uterus prostate and brain . Although it has been mainly used for ablative procedures the ability of FUS to open the blood brain barrier presents a promising new application . However the mechanism of BBB opening by FUS remains unclear . This review focuses on the use of FUS to open the BBB for enhancing drug delivery and investigating how Positron Emission Tomography provides insight into the underlying mechanism .

@highlight FUS may be a useful technique to enhance cerebral drug delivery.
@highlight The mechanism of BBB opening by FUS remains unclear.
@highlight The effect of FUS and microbubbles on the mechanism of BBB transporters remains undetermined.
@highlight PET may be a promising quantitative approach to assess the molecular effects of sonication.
