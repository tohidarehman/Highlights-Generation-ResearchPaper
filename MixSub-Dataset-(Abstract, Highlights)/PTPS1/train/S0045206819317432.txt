 Corn processing generates thousands of tons of cob husks which still contains many valuable elements . To make the most of these wastes they are applied as substrates for biotransformations procedures . This approach allowed converting or releasing the elements deposited in the plant material and obtaining valuable products . Thus bioconversion of corn cob husks using a fungus of the

@highlight Silica nanoparticles were obtained from corn cobs husks.
@highlight was responsible for transformation of amorphous form of silica to structured silica nanoparticles.
@highlight Efficiency of bioconversion was 47 .
@highlight Silica nanoparticles were spherical and had 4070nm in size.
