 acetic acids exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities . Among them the only derivative used in clinical practice is the aldose reductase inhibitor epalrestat . Structurally related compounds 5

@highlight Six rhodanine acetic acid derivatives were tested for aldose reductase inhibition.
@highlight Four compounds inhibited aldose reductase more potently than epalrestat.
@highlight Inhibition selectivity relative to aldehyde reductase exceeded that of epalrestat.
@highlight Negligible cytotoxicity to the HepG2 cell line was recorded for all compounds.
@highlight SAR evaluation indicated a way how to improve inhibition parameters further.
