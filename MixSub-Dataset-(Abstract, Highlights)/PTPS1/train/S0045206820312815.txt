 The oral squamous cell carcinoma stands out as a public health problem due to its high incidence and low survival rate despite advances in diagnosis and treatment . Moreover the most commonly chemotherapeutic agents for OSCC such as carboplatin and cisplatin generate important side effects evidencing the urgency in developing new drugs . Naphthoquinones are an important class of natural products or synthetic compounds with cytotoxic effect demonstrated on different cancer types . In the present study thirty five 1 4 naphthoquinones tethered to 1 2 3 1

@highlight Thirty five new compounds of triazole naphthoquinones were synthesized.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight were able to induce cytotoxicity in human OSCC cell lines.
@highlight Compound
@highlight showed the higher SI value on cells and low toxic effects on mice.
@highlight Compound
@highlight induces apoptosis and acts on the microtubule topoisomerases and hPKM2.
@highlight might be considered as a lead compound for future cancer therapy.
