 The blood brain barrier prevents passage of large and hydrophilic molecules undermining efforts to deliver most active molecules proteins and other macromolecules . To date nanoparticle assisted delivery has been extensively studied to overcome this challenge but with limited success . On the other hand for certain brain therapeutic applications periphery confined particles could be of immediate therapeutic usefulness . The modulation of CNS dysfunctions from the peripheral compartment is a promising approach as it does not involve invasive interventions . From recent studies three main roles could be identified for periphery confined particles brain tissue detoxification

@highlight The BBB is a highly selective barrier limiting nano carrier penetration in the brain.
@highlight Periphery confined particulate systems can modulate some brain dysfunctions or toxicities.
@highlight Periphery confined particles could contribute to brain detoxification

@highlight None
@highlight Peripheral particles could improve drug pharmacokinetics as circulating drug reservoirs.
@highlight Peripheral particles could target brain vascular endothelium in vascular related dysfunctions.
