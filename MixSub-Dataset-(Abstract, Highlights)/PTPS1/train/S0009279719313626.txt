 Antimicrobial resistance remains a serious problem that results in high mortality and increased healthcare costs globally . One of the major issues is that resistant pathogens decrease the efficacy of conventional antimicrobials . Accordingly development of novel antimicrobial agents and therapeutic strategies is urgently needed to overcome the challenge of antimicrobial resistance . A potential strategy is to kill pathogenic microorganisms via the formation of reactive oxygen species . ROS are defined as a number of highly reactive molecules that comprise molecular oxygen O

@highlight Reactive oxygen species ROS could combat antimicrobial resistance.
@highlight ROS are used as an antimicrobial strategy because of their toxicity to a broad range of microbial pathogens.
@highlight ROS exert antimicrobial activity via an induction of oxidative stress in microbial cells.
@highlight Oxidative stress caused by ROS leads to microbial DNA damage and ultimately inducing cell death.
