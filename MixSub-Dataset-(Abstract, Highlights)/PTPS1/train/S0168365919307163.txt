 In spinal cord injury the initial damage leads to a rapidly escalating cascade of degenerative events known as secondary injury . Loss of mitochondrial homeostasis after SCI mediated primarily by oxidative stress is considered to play a crucial role in the proliferation of secondary injury cascade . We hypothesized that effective exogenous delivery of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase encapsulated in biodegradable nanoparticles at the lesion site would protect mitochondria from oxidative stress and hence the spinal cord from secondary injury . Previously in a rat contusion model of severe SCI we demonstrated extravasation and retention of intravenously administered nanoparticles specifically at the lesion site . To test our hypothesis a single dose of nano SOD CAT in saline was administered intravenously 6h post injury and the spinal cords were analyzed one week post treatment . Mitochondria isolated from the affected region of the spinal cord of nano SOD CAT treated animals demonstrated significantly reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species activities increased mitochondrial membrane potential reduced calcium levels and also higher adenosine triphosphate production capacity than those isolated from the spinal cords of untreated control or SOD CAT solution treated animals . Although the treatment did not achieve the same mitochondrial function as in the spinal cords of sham control animals it significantly attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction following SCI . Further immunohistochemical analyses of the spinal cords of treated animals showed significantly lower ROS cleaved caspase 3 and cytochrome
