 The optimization and synthesis of new CK2 and CK1 inhibitors are the basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders associated with overexpression and abnormal functioning of these enzymes . Triazole derivatives appear to be especially interesting as potential kinase inhibitors . In this context we synthesized a series of 1 2 4 triazolin 5 thione derivatives as CK1 kinase inhibitors . The antiproliferative activity of synthesized compounds was assessed against cancer cells human lung adenocarcinoma human hepatoma and human breast adenocarcinoma . Compound

@highlight CK1 kinase inhibitors with anticancer activity are reported.
@highlight The compounds are 1 2 4 triazolin 5 thione derivatives.
@highlight Modifications of the compounds are necessary to achieve greater inhibitory activity.
@highlight The compounds have similar binding mode as a co crystallized inhibitor.
@highlight Further studies are required to look for additional drug targets of the compounds.
