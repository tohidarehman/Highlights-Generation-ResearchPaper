 Herbal medicines and their bioactive compounds are increasingly being recognized as useful drugs for cancer treatments . The parasitic fungus Cordyceps militaris is an attractive anticancer herbal since it shows very powerful anticancer activity due to its phytocompound cordycepin . We previously discovered and reported that a high amount of xylitol is present in Cordyceps militaris extract and that xylitol unexpectedly showed anticancer activity in a cancer selective manner . We thus hypothesized that xylitol could become a useful supplement to help prevent various cancers if we can clarify the specific machinery by which xylitol induces cancer cell death . It is also unclear whether xylitol acts on cancer suppression

@highlight Xylitol induces selective cancer death through oxidative stress caused by the induced CHAC1.
@highlight Xylitol mediated CHAC1 induction is required for the ER stress.
