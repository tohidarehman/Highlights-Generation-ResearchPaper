 In this study we introduced 1 2 4 triazole groups into panaxadiol to obtain 18 panaxadiol triazole derivatives . Five cancer cells and one normal cell were evaluated for cytotoxicity by MTT assay . The results showed that most of the derivatives could inhibit cancer cell proliferation and the anti proliferative activity of compound
