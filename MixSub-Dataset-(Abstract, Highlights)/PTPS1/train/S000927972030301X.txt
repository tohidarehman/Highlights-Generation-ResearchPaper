 Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease that is closely associated with inflammation . Stachydrine is a bioactive alkaloid with anti inflammatory activity . However the role of STA in OA remains unknown . This study aimed to explore the effects of STA on OA chondrocytes in the presence of IL 1 . Primary human OA chondrocytes were pretreated with various concentrations of STA for 2h and then stimulated with IL 1 for 24h . Inflammatory mediators and cytokines including NO PGE2 TNF and IL 6 in chondrocytes were detected to reflect inflammation status . Production of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes including MMP 3 MMP 13 ADAMTS 4 and ADAMTS 5 in chondrocytes was measured using ELISA . The expression levels of iNOS COX 2 p65 p p65 p IB and IB were detected by Western blot analysis . Our results showed that STA significantly suppressed IL 1 induced inflammation with decreased levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines including NO PGE2 iNOS COX 2 TNF and IL 6 . Treatment with STA suppressed the production of ECM degrading enzymes including MMP 3 MMP 13 ADAMTS 4 and ADAMTS 5 in IL 1 induced chondrocytes . Furthermore STA blocked the IL 1 mediated potentiation of NF B pathway in chondrocytes . In conclusion these findings demonstrated that STA protected chondrocytes from IL 1 induced inflammation through the NF B signaling pathway .
