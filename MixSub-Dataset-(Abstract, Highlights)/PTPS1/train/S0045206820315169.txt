 Over the last decade there has been substantial interest in the use of melatonin and MLT like compounds in the treatment of several diseases . MLT can scavenge different reactive oxygen species and can also stimulate the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes .

@highlight A novel series of twenty one indole based MLT analogues were design and synthesized.
@highlight The synthesized compounds were characterized on the basis of
@highlight H and
@highlight C NMR mass spectra and elemental analyses.
@highlight Anticancer potential of the compounds were evaluated both by their antioxidant and CYP1 inhibitory activities.
@highlight Cytotoxic activity of the compounds was further evaluated by the MTT assay in CHO K1 cells.
@highlight In conclusion MLT derivatives represent promising scaffolds for discovery of effective antioxidant agents.
