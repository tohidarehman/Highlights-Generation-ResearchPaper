 A growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to nonylphenol a typical persistent organic pollutant in early life results in the impairment of the central nervous system but the underlying mechanism still remains to be elucidated . High levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in the brain have been implicated in the CNS damages . The animal model of exposure to NP in early life was established by maternal gavage during the pregnancy and lactation in the present study . We found that exposure to NP in early life increased the levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in the rat prefrontal cortex . Interestingly the levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in the intestine as well as in the serum were also increased by NP exposure . Furthermore the increased permeability of intestinal barrier and blood brain barrier two critical barriers in the gut to brain communication was observed in the rats exposed to NP in early lives . The decreased expression of zonula occludens 1 and claudin 1 tight junction proteins that responsible for maintaining the permeability of intestinal barrier and BBB was found which may underlie these increases in permeability . Taken together these results suggested that the disturbed gut brain communication may contribute to the increased levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in the prefrontal cortex caused by NP exposure in early life .

@highlight NP exposure in early life increased pro inflammatory cytokines in prefrontal cortex.
@highlight NP exposure in early life also increased these cytokines in intestine and serum.
@highlight Gut brain communication may contribute to increased cytokines in prefrontal cortex.
