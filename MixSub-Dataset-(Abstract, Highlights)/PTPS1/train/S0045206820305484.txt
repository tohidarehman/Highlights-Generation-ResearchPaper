 Since cancer cells have different mitochondrial bioenergetic requirements than non cancerous cells therapeutic inhibition of its mitochondrial functionality continues to be an important target for anticancer drug discovery . In this study a series of acylhydroquinones with different acyl chain length and their chlorinated derivatives in the aromatic ring synthesized by Fries rearrangement under microwave irradiation were evaluated for their anticancer activity in two leukemia cell lines . Findings from the primary and secondary screening of the 18 acylhydroquinones tested at 5M on acute promyelocytic leukemia HL 60 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells lines identified an acylchlorohydroquinone

@highlight We identify acylhydroquinones with selective action on promyelocytic leukemia cells.
