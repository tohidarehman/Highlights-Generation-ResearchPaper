 A series of coumarin linked 1 2 4 oxadiazoles were synthesized and the synthesized compounds were subjected for evaluation against the four physiologically and pharmacologically relevant hCA isoforms hCA I II IX and XII . Upon evaluation of the results it was inferred that the coumarin linked 1 2 4 oxadiazoles showed selective hCA IX and XII inhibition over hCA I and II . The inhibition constants ranged from low nanomolar to moderately nanomolar . Compounds

@highlight A series of coumarin linked 1 2 4 oxadiazoles was synthesized.
@highlight The coumarin 1 2 4 oxadiazole hybrids were investigated for inhibition against four isoforms hCA I II IX and XII.
@highlight The compounds exhibited low nanomolar to moderate nanomolar inhibitory profiles for both the isoforms particularly for CA XII with K
@highlight s in the range of 23.6315.6 nM for CA IX and 1.0752.6 for CA XII.
@highlight The compounds showed exclusive selectivity for hCA IX and XII over hCA I and II.
