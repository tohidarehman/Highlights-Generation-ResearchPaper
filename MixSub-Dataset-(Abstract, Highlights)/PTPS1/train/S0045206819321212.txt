 Herin we report the design synthesis full characterization and biological investigation of new 15 LOX COX dual inhibitors based on 1 3 thiazolidin 4 one and 1 3 4 thiadiazole scaffolds . This series of molecular modifications is an extension of a previously reported series to further explore the structural activity relationship . Compounds

@highlight Efficient synthesis of 1 3 4 thiadiazole 4 thiazolidinone hybrids modified at the 5th position of thiadiazole and or thiazolidinone.
@highlight The
@highlight and
@highlight anti inflammatory activities were determined. These activities affected significantly by the size of the substituent at the 5th position.
@highlight New compounds with potent dual COX 2 15 LOX inhibition good
@highlight activity and good gastric safety profile were obtained.
