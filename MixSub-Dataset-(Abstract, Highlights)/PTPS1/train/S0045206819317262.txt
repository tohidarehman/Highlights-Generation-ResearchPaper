@highlight Dendrimer G
@highlight  glucosamine conjugation was synthesized and characterization was confirmed by FT IR 
@highlight H NMR and LCMS spectrums and SLS technique.
@highlight cytotoxicity of dendrimer glucosamine conjugation was investigated by XTT and apoptosis necrosis assay.
@highlight Radiolabeling was done with the efficiency of 94 and no exchanged in human serum have indicated high stability of the
@highlight Tc DGC.
@highlight SPECT imaging blocking and dynamic study were studied in rabbit model.
@highlight Biodistribution study was done in different times.
