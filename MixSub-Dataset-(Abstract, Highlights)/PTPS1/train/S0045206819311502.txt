 A set of 21 halogenated thiosemicarbazones have been synthesized and its inhibitory properties toward activity diphenolase of mushroom tyrosinase and their ability to inhibition of melanogenesis in B16F10 murine melanoma cell line have been investigated . The molecular docking to the active site of the enzyme has been also performed to investigate the nature of enzyme inhibitor interactions . The obtained outcomes allowed us to perform SAR analysis . TSC 6 12 and 21 exhibited the most potent inhibitory properties showing IC

@highlight Introducing halogen atoms to the TSC structure improves the inhibition of tyrosinase.
@highlight S atom of thiourea moiety interacts with Cu ions in the active site of tyrosinase.
@highlight Halogenated thiosemicarbazones inhibit melanogenesis in B16F10 cell lines.
@highlight  fluoroacetophenone thiosemicarbazone is non toxic potent inhibitor of tyrosinase.
