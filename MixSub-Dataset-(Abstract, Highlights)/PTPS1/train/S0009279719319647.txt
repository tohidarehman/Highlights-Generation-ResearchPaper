 Epithelial mesenchymal transformation plays a crucial role in the metastasis of bladder cancer which makes bladder cancer difficult to cure . Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary system and distant metastasis is the leading cause of death . Therefore finding a bioactive drug that can specifically inhibit epithelial mesenchymal transformation may be a new direction for bladder cancer treatment in the future .
