 Biomedical hydrogel has been widely used as regenerative biomaterials however an immune inflammatory response of hydrogel constantly crops up in body due to crosslinking agent external stimulus or small molecule residues . Here we present a strategy to treat pelvic organ prolapse by combining both anti inflammatory and promote tissue regeneration using drug loaded hydrogel to reconstruct the pelvic floor and minimize multiple inflammations . Photo crosslinked gelatin hydrogel loaded with Puerarin regulate inflammation by inhibiting the aggregation of neutrophils and eosinophils simultaneously intervene the matrix regenerating remodeling via TGF MMPs pathway to repair the fascia of pelvic floor in rabbit models . The assessment of inflammatory cytokines expression in human uterus fibroblasts and extracellular matrix related factors was performed in rabbit . Immune microenvironment was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in rabbit samples . Pue loaded GelMA

@highlight Proposing a new anti inflammatory biomaterial of drug loaded hydrogel.
@highlight Ensuring stable structure and multi pore distribution of the hydrogel.
@highlight Realizing high capacity loading of the drug into the hydrogel and control release.
@highlight Achieving good biocompatibility for cell attachment and tissue regeneration.
