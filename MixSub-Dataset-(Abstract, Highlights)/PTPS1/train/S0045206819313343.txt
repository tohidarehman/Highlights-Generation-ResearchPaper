 Selective estrogen receptor degrader that acts as not only ER antagonist but also ER degrader would be useful for the treatment for drug resistance ER breast cancer . However most of currently available SERD candidates involve very limited molecular scaffolds and are still in clinical trials . In this study we introduced a 1 3 5 triazine ring into a homobibenzyl motif extracted from amounts of ER ligands and synthesized sixteen SERDs bearing acrylic acid or acrylic amide side chains that possess both ER antagonism and degradation properties . And all compounds were screened for their anti proliferative activity against ER MCF 7 and Ishikawa cell lines . Among them compound

@highlight A series of 1 3 5 triazine based SERDs were synthesized and biologically evaluated.
@highlight show outstanding cell antiproliferation and ER degradation activities.
@highlight reduce the expression of PR mRNA induced by estradiol in MCF 7.
@highlight Docking and dynamic simulation uncover probable binding model of
@highlight with ER.
@highlight 1 3 5 triazine core could act as a potential SERDs scaffold.
