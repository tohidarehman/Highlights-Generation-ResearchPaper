 Worldwide studies towards development of new drugs with a lower rate in emergence of bacterial resistance have been conducted . The molecular docking analysis gives a possibility to predict the activity of new compounds before to perform their synthesis . In this work the molecular docking analysis of 64 Linezolid dipeptide type analogues was performed to predict their activity . The most negative scores correspond to six Fmoc protected analogues

@highlight A stereoselective synthesis of 26 Linezolid dipeptide type analogous was performed.
@highlight Docking analysis shows the coupling of Linezolid dipeptide type analogues in PTC.
@highlight Linezolid analogues display antibacterial activity against clinical isolates.
@highlight Linezolid dipeptide type analogous preserve the cellular integrity of ARPE 19 cells.
