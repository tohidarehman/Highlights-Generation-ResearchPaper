 The compositions of the gut microbiota and its metabolites were altered in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder . The aim of this study was to assess whether plasma levels of gut derived metabolite trimethylamine N oxide were associated with ASD and the degree of symptom severity . From September 2017 to January 2019 a total of three hundred and twenty eight Chinese children aged 38 years were included . TMAO levels in plasma were determined using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the TMAO ASD association . In the study the median age of the ASD group was 5 years 46 years and 129 were boys . The median plasma levels of TMAO in children with ASD and typically developing children at admission were 4.2 mol l and 3.0 mol l respectively . For each 1mol l increase of plasma TMAO the unadjusted and adjusted risk of ASD would be increased by 54 of 1.54 95 confidence intervals 1.321.78 P 0.001 and 27 P 0.001 respectively . Symptom severity was classified as mild to moderate for 66 children with ASD . In these children the plasma levels of TMAO were lower than in the 98 children with ASD whose symptoms were classified as severe mol l Elevated plasma levels of TMAO were associated with ASD and symptom severity .

@highlight Compositions of the gut microbiota and its metabolites were altered in ASD.
@highlight The plasma levels of TMAO in ASD were higher than in typical children.
@highlight For each 1 umol l increase of TMAO the risk of severe autism will increase 61 .
@highlight There was an association between elevated plasma levels of TMAO and ASD risk and severity.
