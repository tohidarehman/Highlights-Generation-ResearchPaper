 The investigation of conformational features of regions of amyloidogenic proteins are of great interest to deepen the structural changes and consequent self aggregation mechanisms at the basis of many neurodegenerative diseases . Here we explore the effect of hairpin inducing motifs on regions of prion protein covering strands S1 and S2 . In detail we unveiled the structural and functional features of two model chimeric peptides in which natural sequences are covalently linked together by two dipeptides
