 The present study was to systematically evaluate the enhancement action efficacy and sites of chemical permeation enhancer which provided references for the reasonable application of CPEs and the formula optimization of transdermal patch . Enhancement action efficacy was characterized using an indicator of comprehensive enhancement effect

@highlight The present study provided a systematic evaluation approach to determination of enhancement action efficacy and sites of CPEs.
@highlight The enhancement action efficacy and sites of CPEs were determined by its physicochemical parameters.
@highlight Hydrophilic CPEs obtained highest
@highlight indicated that its enhancement action site was polymer matrix and CPEs with high log
@highlight  molecular weight and polarizability showed highest
@highlight  which indicated that its enhancement action site was skin.
