 CREB binding protein is a large multi domain protein containing a HAT domain catalyzing transacetylation and a bromodomain responsible for acetylated lysine recognition . CBPs could act as transcription co activators to regulate gene expression and have been shown to play a significant role in the development and progression of many cancers . Herein through
