 Shortly after the Gulf War in 19901991 service men and women began reporting multiple symptoms ranging from persistent headaches widespread pain chronic fatigue cognitive dysfunction mood dysregulation gastrointestinal issues skin abnormalities and respiratory problems . This prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to initially classify the disorder as chronic multi symptom illness where it later became known as Gulf War Illness . Researchers and healthcare professionals since the early 1990s have been working extensively on alleviating the symptoms expressed in GWI as well as attempting to understand the mechanisms behind this illness . Scientific literature as well as reports from GWI veterans indicate that the toxic exposures during deployment may be responsible for the symptoms . These toxic exposures potentially include nerve agents pyridostigmine bromide pills pesticides munitions with depleted uranium and burning oil well fires . GWI currently affects 2532 of the 697 000 American troops who were stationed overseas during the short conflict . The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on neurotoxic exposures in Gulf War Illness to explain how these exposures may lead to glutamate excitotoxicity which has been implicated in the majority of the symptoms characterizing the illness and to propose a novel treatment option for GWI .

@highlight Gulf War Illness GWI is a multi symptom chronic condition associated with neurotoxic exposures.
@highlight Troops were exposed to burning munitions oil fires pesticides and uranium.
@highlight Multiple of these toxins can increase glutamate levels leading to excitotoxicity.
@highlight Toxic particulates may lead to glutamate excitotoxicity induced oxidative stress.
@highlight Future research should examine glutamate dysregulation and oxidative stress in GWI.
