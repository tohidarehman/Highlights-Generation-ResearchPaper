 CD147 is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a member of immunoglobulin superfamily is strongly expressed in melanoma cells . CD147 has a pivotal role in tumor development . Therefore it is a potential drug target for melanoma . In this article we report the discovery of the first CD147 protein proteolysis targeting chimeras derived from the natural product pseudolaric acid B . The representative compound

@highlight Designed synthesized and evaluated a series of PROTACs for CD147 by using a multiple linker design approach.
@highlight The
@highlight effectively induced degradation of CD147 in a dose dependent manner and was the first available PROTAC for inducing CD147 degradation resulting inhibition of melanoma cells malignant
