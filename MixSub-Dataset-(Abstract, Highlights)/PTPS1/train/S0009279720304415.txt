 Acacetin is a natural flavonoid that is widely distributed in plants and possesses numerous pharmacological activities . The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of acacetin on the activities of the cytochrome P450 family members CYP1A2 CYP2B1 CYP2C11 CYP2D1 CYP2E1 and CYP3A2 in rat liver microsomes

@highlight We investigated effects of acacetin on activities of cytochrome P450 family members.
@highlight UPLC MS MS method developed for simultaneous detection of substrates and metabolites.
@highlight  CYP2B1 CYP2C11 CYP2E1 CYP1A2 and CYP3A2 were inhibited by acacetin.
@highlight  AUC CL and C
@highlight of drug substrates differed significantly with acacetin.
@highlight Acacetin could cause toxicity and drug interactions via cytochrome P450 inhibition.
