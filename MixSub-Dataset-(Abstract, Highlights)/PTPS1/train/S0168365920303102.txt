 Every year complications during pregnancy affect more than 26 million women . Some of those diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality as is the case of preeclampsia the main cause of maternal deaths globally . The ability to improve the delivery of drugs to the placenta upon administration to the mother may offer new opportunities in the treatment of diseases of pregnancy . The objective of this study was to develop megalin targeting liposome nanocarriers for placental drug delivery . Megalin is a transmembrane protein involved in clathrin mediated endocytic processes and is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast an epithelial layer at maternal fetal interface . Targeting megalin thus offers an opportunity for the liposomes to hitchhike into the SynT thus enriching the concentration of any associated therapeutic cargo in the placental tissue . PEGylated lipids were modified with gentamicin a substrate to megalin receptors as we have shown in earlier studies and used to prepare placental targeting liposomes . The ability of the targeting liposomes to enhance accumulation of a fluorescence probe was assessed in an
