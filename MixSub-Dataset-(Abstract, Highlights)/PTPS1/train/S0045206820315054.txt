 Based on the structure of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 a series of 1 4 naphthoquinones derived from plumbagin with STAT3 inhibition potential were designed synthesized and biologically evaluated

@highlight Novel 1 4 naphthoquinones were designed synthesized and biologically evaluated.
@highlight showed the best antitumor activity and weaker cytotoxicity than PL.
@highlight could suppress the phosphorylation of STAT3 as well as the downstream genes.
