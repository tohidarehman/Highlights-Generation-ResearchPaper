 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is rich in cancer associated fibroblasts which participate in the formation of tumor stroma . However the dense tumor stroma of PDAC presents major barriers to drug delivery resulting in an obstacle for PDAC therapy . Considering the special tumor microenvironment of PDAC we constructed a novel nanoparticle which is responsive to the membrane biomarker FAP on CAFs and near infrared laser irradiation . Small sized albumin nanoparticle of paclitaxel with strong tumor penetration ability was encapsulated into the CAP modified thermosensitive liposomes . Moreover IR 780 a photothermal agent was incorporated into CAP TSL to afford CAP ITSL . The designed
