 Metastatic triple negative breast cancer is one of the most devastating cancer types . Systemic chemotherapy is necessary but its clinical performance is largely limited by severe side effects . Herein we report a mertansine prodrug which could self assemble into spherical nanoparticles in water and readily convert into active mertansine at the presence of glutathione . The self assembling mertansine prodrugs entered cancer cells via a caveolae mediated pathway and exhibited potent cytotoxicity . The self delivering SAMPDs did not cause hemolysis and more importantly increased maximum tolerated dose of mertansine by 8 folds via reducing free mertansine exposure in most of the major organs . SAMPDs improved intratumoral drug exposure and showed dose dependent antitumor activity . When dosed at MTD SAMPDs inhibited primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis by 80 and 95 while mertansine dosed at MTD only reduced primary tumor growth and metastasis by 50 and 60 respectively . Our results reveal the mechanism of in vivo biotransformation of self assembling prodrug and highlight the unique advantages of self assembling prodrug strategy in improving the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy .
