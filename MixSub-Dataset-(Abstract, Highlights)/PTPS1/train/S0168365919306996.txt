 Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury is a serious threat to the health and lives of patients without any effective therapy . Excessive production of reactive oxygen species is considered a principal cause of MIRI . Some natural products including ginsenoside Rg3 exhibit robust antioxidant activity . However the lack of an effective delivery strategy for this hydrophobic compound hinders its clinical application . In addition therapeutic targets and molecular mechanisms of Rg3 require further elucidation to establish its mode of action . This study aimed to generate ROS responsive nanoparticles

@highlight A self assembly of diblock copolymers of PEG and PPS was used for encapsulation and delivery of Rg3.
@highlight Rg3 loaded PEG b PPS responded to ROS produced by myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury MIRI and released Rg3.
@highlight The Rg3 targeted and activated FoxO3a which had anti oxidative anti inflammatory and anti fibrotic functions.
@highlight The intramyocardial injection of Rg3 loaded PEG b PPS exhibits an excellent performance in alleviating MIRI.
