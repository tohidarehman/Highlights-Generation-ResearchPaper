 Although the chemosensitizing effect of Dexamethasone and its ability to increase the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapy were previously reported this study aimed to explore how far cotreatment of breast cancer cells with paclitaxel and DEX mimics the anticancer effect of nanoformulated PTX . To establish this goal PTX was nanoformulated with poly lactic

@highlight Breast cancer cells were treated with nano formulated PTX or cotreated with PTX and DEX.
@highlight The results highlight an equivalent antineoplastic effect of PTX DEX relative to the nano PTX.
@highlight DEX improved the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to PTX. Also DEX enhanced the expression of CYP2C8 and down regulated TXR1.
