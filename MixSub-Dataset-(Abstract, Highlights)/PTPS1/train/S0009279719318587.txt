 Inflammatory responses play a remarkable role in the mechanisms of acute and chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer . Currently there is a resurgence in the use of drugs from natural sources for various ailments as potent therapeutics . Berberine an alkaloid prominent in the Chinese traditional system of medicine has been reported to exert therapeutic properties in various diseases . Nevertheless the number of studies focusing on the curative potential of berberine in inflammatory diseases involving the respiratory system is limited . In this review we have attempted to discuss the reported anti inflammatory properties of berberine that function through several pathways such as the NF B ERK1 2 and p38 MAPK pathways which affect several pro inflammatory cytokines in the pathophysiological processes involved in chronic respiratory diseases . This review would serve to provide valuable information to researchers who work in this field and a new direction in the field of drug discovery with respect to respiratory diseases .
