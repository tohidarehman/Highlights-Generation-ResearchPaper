 Herein we describe the design and synthesis of new benzenesulfonamide derivatives as selective COX 2 inhibitors based on bumetanide scaffold . Benzenesulfonamides bearing both the pyrazole

@highlight Novel and selective COX 2 inhibitors based on bumetanide scaffold were developed.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight  and
@highlight were more potent than celecoxib.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight  and
@highlight were remarkably selective toward COX 2 over COX 1.
@highlight Docking showed a unique binding mode for
@highlight  and
@highlight in the active site of COX 2.
@highlight Selected compounds showed low ulcerogenic activity when administrated orally.
