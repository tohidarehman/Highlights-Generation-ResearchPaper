 The majority of cancers detected every year are treated with anti cancer compounds . Unfortunately many tumors become resistant to antineoplastic drugs . One option is to use cocktails of compounds acting on different targets to try to overcome the resistant cells . This type of approach can produce good results but is often accompanied by a sharp increase of associated side effects .
