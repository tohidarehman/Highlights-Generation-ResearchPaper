 Sitosterols is a common steroid that can be identified in a variety of plants and their efficacy in promoting wound healing has been demonstrated . Na

@highlight Fifty seven
@highlight  sitosterol derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for Na
@highlight  K
@highlight  ATPase inhibitory and cell proliferation activity.
@highlight were the most potent inhibitory against Na
@highlight  K
@highlight  ATPase IC
@highlight 3.0 3.4 2.2M with high efficiency and
@highlight showed highly wounding healing activity in vivo.
@highlight Na
@highlight  K
@highlight  ATPase may be considered as a potential target for wound healing firstly.
@highlight We hypothesized that
@highlight is a promising accelerate wound healing agent.
