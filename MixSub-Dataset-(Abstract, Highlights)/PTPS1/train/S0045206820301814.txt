 In this study new pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives were designed and evaluated for anticancer activity . PIM 1 inhibitiory activity were measured for the most potent compounds . Molecular docking study and molecular dynamics were also done .

@highlight Novel pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives have been synthesized and characterized.
@highlight 2D NMR experiments were used to confirm regiospecific structure of pyrimidine ring.
@highlight These derivatives showed clear antitumor activities
@highlight against MCF 7 and HCT 116 cell lines.
@highlight PIM 1 inhibitory activity was measured for the most active derivatives.
@highlight Molecular docking study and molecular dynamic simulation were conducted.
