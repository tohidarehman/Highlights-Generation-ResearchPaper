 Multifactorial neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer s disease are considered a growing public health problem due the rising incidence and low effectiveness of current treatments . Since pharmacotherapy based on a single target has been insufficient for drug development in complex diseases the emerging multi target approach is a promising strategy for the search of new anti AD drug candidates . Herein described natural isoquinoline alkaloids were investigated for multi target activity on key mechanisms associated with the ADs pathogenesis i.e . cholinergic depletion beta amyloid aggregation and oxidative stress . Alkaloid isolation from root extract of

@highlight From root extract of
@highlight 8 isoquinoline alkaloids were obtained.
@highlight Benzophenanthridine alkaloids showed higher MTDL potential compared to protoberberines.
@highlight Nitidine and avicine are reversible mixed inhibitors of AChE BuChE and MAO A.
@highlight Avicine and nitidine are promising multifunctional neuroprotective candidates.
@highlight Benzophenanthridine scaffold is a suitable start for MTDLs anti Alzheimers agents.
