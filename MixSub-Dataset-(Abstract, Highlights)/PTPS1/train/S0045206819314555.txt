 The structure guided virtual screening has proved to be successful strategy in identification of new scaffolds for biological targets . The overactivity of NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in variety of inflammatory diseases including Alzheimer s disease . The up regulation of estrogen receptor activity has been directly linked with inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activity . In the present study we report discovery of new NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors via ER crystal structure guided virtual screening of 20 000 compound library . For experimental validation top 10 ligands were selected based on structure novelty docking score prime MMGB SA binding affinity and interaction pattern analysis . Amongst the tested compounds three thiazolidin 4 ones IIIM 1268 IIIM 1269 and IIIM 1270 and benzo
