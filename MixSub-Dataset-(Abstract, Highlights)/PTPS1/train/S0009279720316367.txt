 DNA is the store house of all necessary hereditary information for growth of cells and tissues . Physiological functionality of DNA depends on its 3D helical structure and any distortion in a structure may lead to mutation and genomic instability that may translate into disease like cancer . In order to prevent DNA damage an exogenous compound is required that can either scavenge the excess free radicals or enhance the structural integrity of DNA through binding . In the present study the binding mechanism of ethyl pyruvate with DNA models using different spectroscopic techniques was investigated for their structural integrity . Besides 2 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl and ferric reducing antioxidant power assays were performed to determine the antioxidant scavenging of EP . Plasmid DNA relaxation assay was performed to assess the radioprotection efficacy of EP in the plasmid DNA . Circular dichroism and UVVis absorbance spectroscopic data confirmed the conformation change in ctDNA upon binding with EP . The molecular docking visualized that EP stacks between the DNA bases with a glide score of 2.117

@highlight CD and UVVis spectra of ctDNA indicated conformational change after EP binding.
@highlight Docking showed EP binds reversibly as an intercalator and in a minor groove of DNA.
@highlight EP is an effective antioxidant.
@highlight EP significantly protects DNA against radiation induced damage.
