 Iron based nanomaterials as the main ferroptosis inducing platforms are more promising because iron itself is a key component in the Fenton reaction to produce ROS . However the Fe dose needs to be very high in order to induce ferroptosis based cancer treatment using the SPIO NPs . Therefore it is still of great challenge to enhance the efficacy of ferroptosis based cancer therapy by associating the iron based nanomaterials with other components and therapeutic modalities . In this study sorafenib and ultrasmall SPIO nanoparticles were loaded into the mesopores and onto the surface of MPDA NPs to form

@highlight The nanodrug was responsive to pH temperature and glutathane to release ferric ferrous ions and Sorafenib.
@highlight The nanodrug represents a theranostic system allowing MRI to guide a combination ferroptosis and photothermal therapy.
