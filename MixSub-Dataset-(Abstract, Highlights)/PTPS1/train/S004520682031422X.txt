 In this study we have synthesized a new series of benzimidazole triazole hybrids as galectin 1 mediated apoptosis inducing agents and evaluated for their potential anticancer activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines

@highlight The 7c is a potent cytotoxic agent against global major leading lung cancer burden.
@highlight It has shown IC
@highlight of 0.630.21M and 0.990.01M in lung cancer cells A 549 and NCI H460 mediated by gal 1.
@highlight The 7c is capable of binding with gal 1 based on the confirmation studies of SPR and FS.
@highlight The
@highlight F 7c radiotracer is considered as an ideal PET tracer due to its 110min half life.
@highlight The radiochemical purity identity of
@highlight F 7c was validated as per cGMP guidelines for clinical evaluation.
