 Astrocytes are key stromal components in glioblastoma and have complex interactions with the GBM cells promoting the survival progression and therapy resistance of GBM . In this study we first demonstrated the existence of a reciprocal activation loop mediated by the STAT3 IL 6 signaling between GBC and astrocytes . This loop of reciprocity was found to be initiated by the constitutive activity of STAT3 and downstream expression of IL 6 in the GBC . GBC derived IL 6 activated STAT3 and thereby upregulated IL 6 expression in the astrocytes . Astrocyte derived IL 6 acted back on the GBC causing further activation of STAT3 and leading to enhanced downstream events that promote proliferation migration invasion and apoptosis resistance of the GBC . Next we showed that doxorubicin polyglycerol nanodiamond conjugates which could be delivered via GBM associated macrophages suppressed STAT3 activity in the GBC reducing their IL 6 output to the astrocytes and thereby abolished the astrocytes feedback activation of the GBC . Moreover Nano DOX also suppressed stimulated activation of STAT3 and IL 6 induced by temozolomide a first line anti GBM chemotherapy resistance to which critically involves STAT3 activation . In conclusion Nano DOX could disrupt the STAT3 IL 6 mediated reciprocal activation loop between the GBC and astrocytes . Nano DOX also provides a novel approach to therapeutic modulation of the GBM microenvironment .
