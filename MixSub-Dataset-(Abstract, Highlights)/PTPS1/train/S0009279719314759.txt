 Zebrafish inflammation models were used to evaluate the anti inflammatory activity of isoniazid and preliminarily investigate the underlying mechanism . Local acute and systemic zebrafish inflammation models were established by tail cutting copper sulfate CuSO Compared to those observed in the control inflammation model group the numbers of migrated and accumulated inflammatory cells in zebrafish in the INH treated group significantly decreased . INH significantly decreased the ROS content induced by LPS . Compared to that observed in the LPS model group INH at 1 and 2mM significantly increased the expression of PPAR and inhibited the expression of NF B iba and AP 1 as well as the inflammatory factors TNF TGF IL 1b and COX 2 . In this study different zebrafish inflammation models were used to confirm that INH has anti inflammatory activity . The associated mechanism may occur through the inhibition of ROS release activation of PPAR expression inhibition of the transcriptional regulatory activity of NF B and AP 1 and reduction of INH inflammatory factor expression to relieve inflammation . The results of this study provide references for the clinical application of INH .

@highlight INH exhibited a notable anti inflammatory effect.
@highlight INH mediated decrease in ROS production.
@highlight INH resulted in the activation of PPAR expression.
@highlight INH leaded to the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of NF B and AP 1.
@highlight INH inhibited the expression of related inflammatory factors.
