 Carbazole based novel multifunctional agents has been rationally designed and synthesized as potential anti Alzheimer agents . Multi functional activity of these derivatives have been assessed by performing various in vitro assays and these compounds appeared to be potent AChE inhibitors A aggregation inhibitors anti oxidant and neuroprotective agents . Among the entire series MT 1 and MT 6 were most potent multifunctional agents which displayed effective and selective AChE inhibition A disaggregation anti oxidant and metal chelation action . Neuroprotective activity of MT 6 has been examined against H

@highlight A series of novel carbazole derivatives has been developed as potent multifunctional agents against Alzheimers disease.
@highlight These compounds appeared to be potent AChE inhibitors A aggregation inhibitors anti oxidant and neuroprotective agents.
@highlight MT 1 and MT 6 were most potent multifunctional agents in the entire series.
@highlight MT 6 have shown effective neuroprotective action against H
@highlight induce toxicity in SHSY 5Y cells.
@highlight MT 6 was evaluated against scopolamine induced dementia model of mice and this compound actively improved memory deficit and cognition impairment in this model.
