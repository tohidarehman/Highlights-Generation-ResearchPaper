 Thiazole derivatives are known to possess various biological activities such as antiparasitic antifungal antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities . Matrix metalloproteinases are important protease target involved in tumor progression including angiogenesis tissue invasion and migration . Therefore MMPs have also been reported as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in many types of cancer . Herein new aryl thiazoles were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer effects on a panel of cancer cell lines including the invasive MDA MB 231 line . Some of these compounds showed IC

@highlight 2 Aminothiazoles linked amidine moieties were synthesized as potential anticancer agents.
@highlight The cytotoxic activity was tested against MDA MB 231 HCT 116 and MCF 7 cell lines.
@highlight The thiazole based MMP 2 9 inhibitors have significant potential for anticancer treatment.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight were able to induce cell cycle arrest at G2 M phase cause intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cell death.
