 In the advent of the post antibiotic era new strategies are urgently required to improve the efficacy of antimicrobials and outsmart multi drug resistant bacteria . Exploiting a basic survival mechanism of bacteria lipase production monoolein liquid crystal nanoparticles were investigated as a bacterial triggered drug delivery system for three different antimicrobial compounds and compared with model

@highlight Bacterial lipase triggers the release of antibiotics from liquid crystal nanoparticles.
@highlight Triggered release occurs with hydrophobic and macromolecular antimicrobials.
@highlight Bacterial lipase digests the monoolein cubic structure to trigger the release.
@highlight Non regiospecific lipase digestion kinetics was preferential for triggered release.
