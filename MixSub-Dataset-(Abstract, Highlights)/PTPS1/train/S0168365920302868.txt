 Photocontrolled therapeutic release holds great promise due to its versatile manipulability superb spatiotemporal precision and minimal tissue invasiveness in biomedical purposes . However most of light responsive platforms thus far have relied on UV or visible light which substantially limit the potential applicability in living animals . In recent decades near infrared light mediated theranostic upconversion nanocomposites that integrate conventional UV Vis sensitive materials and classic lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles have significantly promoted the development of deep tissue photoreleasable therapeutics

@highlight Remote controlled therapeutics deliver is vital in precision medicine.
