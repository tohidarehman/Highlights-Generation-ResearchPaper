 Non polio enteroviruses such as enterovirus A71 EV D68 and coxsackievirus B3 are significant human pathogens with disease manifestations ranging from mild flu like symptoms to more severe encephalitis myocarditis acute flaccid paralysis myelitis and even death . There is currently no effective antivirals to prevent or treat non polio enterovirus infection . In this study we report our progress in developing potent and broad spectrum antivirals against these non polio enteroviruses . Starting from our previously developed lead compounds that had potent antiviral activity against EV D68 we synthesized 43 analogs and profiled their broad spectrum antiviral activity against additional EV D68 EV A71 and CVB3 viruses . Promising candidates were also selected for mouse microsomal stability test to prioritize lead compounds for future in vivo mouse model studies . Collectively this multi parameter optimization process revealed a promising lead compound
