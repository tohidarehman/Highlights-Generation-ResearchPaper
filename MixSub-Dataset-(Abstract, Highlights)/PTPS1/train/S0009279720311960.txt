 Two types of cholinesterases are present in mammalian blood and tissues acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase . While AChE regulates neurotransmission by hydrolyzing acetylcholine at the postsynaptic membranes and neuromuscular junctions BChE in plasma has been suggested to be involved in detoxifying toxic compounds . This study was undertaken to establish the identity of circulating ChE activity in plasmas from domestic animals by assessing sensitivity to AChE specific inhibitors and BChE specific inhibitors as well as binding to anti FBS AChE monoclonal antibodies . Based on the inhibition of ChE activity by ChE specific inhibitors it was determined that bovine ovine and caprine plasma predominantly contain AChE while porcine and equine plasma contain BChE . Three of the anti FBS AChE MAbs 4E5 5E8 and 6H9 inhibited 8598 of enzyme activity in bovine ovine and caprine plasma confirming that the esterase in these plasmas was AChE . These MAbs did not bind to purified recombinant human or mouse AChE demonstrating that these MAbs were specific for AChEs from ruminant species . These MAbs did not inhibit the activity of purified human BChE or ChE activity in porcine and equine plasma confirming that the ChE in these plasmas was BChE . Taken together these results demonstrate that anti FBS AChE MAbs can serve as useful tools for distinguishing between AChEs from ruminant and non ruminant species and BChEs .

@highlight Acetylcholinesterase is the predominant esterase in bovine ovine and caprine plasma.
@highlight Porcine and equine plasma contain predominantly butyrylcholinesterase.
@highlight Monoclonal antibodies MAbs against fetal bovine serum AChE inhibit AChEs from ruminants.
@highlight MAbs against fetal bovine serum AChE do not cross react with BChE.
@highlight Residues at positions 241 275 and 287 located near the entrance to the gorge contribute to the binding of MAbs to AChEs.
