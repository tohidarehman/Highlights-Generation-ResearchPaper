 Overconsumption of alcohol could lead to severe liver injury that connects with oxidative stress apoptosis and inflammatory response . Previously we proved that p coumaric acid prevents ethanol induced reproductive toxicity however p coumaric acid on ethanol mediated hepatotoxicity has not been examined yet . In our work we sought to study the potential of PCA in contradiction of ethanol induced hepatoxicity which linking with MAPKs apoptosis oxidative stress and Nrf2 signaling . Foremost we found that PCA could protect ethanol induced both L 02 and HepG2 hepatic cells by inhibiting cytotoxicity ROS production mitochondrial depolarization and nuclear fragmentation . Also

@highlight PCA protects alcohol induced both L 02 and HepG2 hepatic cells.
@highlight PCA attenuates ethanol induced oxidative stress by inhibiting MAPKs.
@highlight PCA also regulates liver regulating biomarkers and antioxidants.
@highlight PCA prevents alcohol induced apoptosis and depletion of Nrf2 related proteins.
@highlight PCA can be considered as alternative therapeutics for alcohol related disease.
