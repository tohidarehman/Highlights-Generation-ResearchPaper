 In situ forming implants allow for a high initial intratumoral concentration and sustained release of the chemotherapeutic . However clinical translation is impeded primarily due to limited drug penetration from the tumor boundary interface and poor intratumoral drug retention . Therapeutic ultrasound has become a popular approach for improving drug penetration of transdermal devices and increasing cellular uptake of nanoparticles . These effects are driven by the mechanical and thermal bioeffects associated with TUS . In this study we characterize the released drug penetration retention and overall therapeutic response when exposing ISFI to the combination of the mechanical and thermal effects of TUS . ISFIs were intratumorally injected into subcutaneous murine tumors then exposed to C TUS exposure 5min duty factor 0.33 frequency 3MHz intensity 2.2W cm

@highlight Ultrasound increases penetration of drugs delivered by intratumoral in situ forming implants.
@highlight Drug retention within tumor cells is enhanced with the application of ultrasound.
@highlight Acoustically driven modulation of intratumoral drug kinetics inhibits tumor growth and improves overall survival.
