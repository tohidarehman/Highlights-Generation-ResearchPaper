 Albumin accumulation in tumours could reflect a role of albumin in transport of endogenous nutrient cargos required for cellular growth and not just a suggested source of amino acids a role driven by albumin engagement with its cognate cellular recycling neonatal Fc receptor . We investigate the hypothesis that albumin cellular recruitment is increased by higher human FcRn expression in human cancer tissue that provides the mechanistic basis for exploitation in albumin based drug designs engineered to optimise this process . Eight out of ten different human cancer tissue types screened for hFcRn expression by immunohistochemistry exhibited significantly higher hFcRn expression compared to healthy tissues . Accelerated tumour growth over 28days in mice inoculated with hFcRn expressing HT 29 human colorectal cancer cell xenografts compared to CRISPR Cas9 hFcRn knockout HT 29 suggests a hFcRn mediated tumour growth effect . Direct correlation between hFcRn expression and albumin recycling supports hFcRn mediated diversion of albumin from lysosomal degradation . Two fold increase in accumulation of fluorescent labelled high binding hFcRn albumin compared to wild type albumin in luciferase MDA MB 231 Luc D3H2LN breast cancer xenografts was shown . This work identifies overexpression of hFcRn in several human cancer types with mechanistic data suggesting hFcRn driven albumin recruitment for increased cellular growth that has the potential to be exploited with high hFcRn binding albumin variants for targeted therapies .
