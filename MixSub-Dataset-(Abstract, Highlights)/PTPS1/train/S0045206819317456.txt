 Seasonal or pandemic influenza virus infections are a worldwide health problem requiring antiviral therapy . Since virus resistance to the established neuraminidase inhibitors and novel polymerase inhibitors is growing new drug targets are needed . Heat shock protein 90 is associated with several aspects of the influenza virus life cycle and is considered a relevant host cell target . We report here on a series of benzo

@highlight A series of benzo 
@highlight  thiazoles was tested for anti influenza virus activity.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight showed low M EC
@highlight values against influenza A and B viruses.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight displayed submicromolar binding affinities for Hsp90.
@highlight Hsp90 inhibition is a plausible mechanism for anti influenza activity of compounds.
