 Polydrug use among adolescence is a widespread phenomenon and has increased in the last few years . In particular most nandrolone decanoate abusers combine its use with cannabis thus studying the consequences of this combination in adolescent subjects is important because potentiation of their effects may increase their neurotoxicity . The present study was designed to study the neurotoxic effects of Nan and Can alone and in combination in adolescent male rats by studying the behavioural biochemical and histopathological effects . Nan and Can were given alone or in combination to rats once daily for one month . The combined administration of Can and Nan induced learning and spatial memory deficits hypo locomotion anxiety and aggression in adolescent rats as evidenced by the Morris water maze open field elevated plus maze and defensive aggression tests . In parallel rats treated with the combination showed severe deleterious effects in the hippocampal and prefrontal cortex neural architecture along with a decrease in brain derived neurotropic factor . Furthermore combined administration of Can and Nan increased oxidative stress elevated brain pro inflammatory cytokines and upregulated caspase 3 caspase 8 and caspase 9 mRNA expression and cytochrome c levels . In conclusion abuse of both Can and Nan conferred greater neurotoxic effects than either drug alone that were at least partially attributed to oxidative stress inflammation and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis in the hippocampus and PFC of rats .

@highlight Coadministration of Can potentiated the neurotoxic effects of Nan in adolescent rats
@highlight Combined abuse of Can and Nan produces serious long term behavioural consequences
@highlight The combination increased oxidative stress in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of adolescent rats
@highlight The combination increased pro inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of adolescent rats
@highlight These neurotoxic effects are also attributed to intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis
