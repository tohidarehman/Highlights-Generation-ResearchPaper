 Renal fibrosis often occurs in chronic kidney disease and effective treatment is needed . Celastrol may attenuate renal fibrosis but it distributes throughout the body leading to severe systemic toxicities . Here we designed a system to deliver CEL specifically to interstitial myofibroblasts which is a key driver of renal fibrogenesis . Fibronectin is highly expressed in fibrotic kidney . The pentapeptide CREKA which specifically binds fibronectin was conjugated to PEGylated liposomes . CREKA coupled liposomes significantly increased the uptake of unmodified liposomes by activated NRK 49F renal fibroblasts . Systemic administration of CREKA Lip to mice led to their accumulation in fibrotic kidney where they were specifically internalized by interstitial myofibroblasts . Loading CEL into CREKA Lip effectively inhibited the activation and proliferation of NRK 49F cells

@highlight CREKA guided liposomes were specifically accumulated in renal interstitial myofibroblasts.
@highlight CREKA guided liposomes loaded with celastrol showed enhanced antifibrotic effects.
@highlight CREKA guided liposomes loaded celastrol significantly decreased systemic toxicity induced by free celastrol.
@highlight CREKA guided liposomes could be a promising universal and safe fibrotic kidney carrier.
