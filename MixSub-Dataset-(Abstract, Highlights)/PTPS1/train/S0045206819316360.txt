 Steroid sulfatase transforms hormone precursors into active steroids . Thus it represents a target of intense research regarding hormone dependent cancers . In this study three ligand based pharmacophore models were developed to identify STS inhibitors from natural sources . In a pharmacophore based virtual screening of a curated molecular TCM database lanostane type triterpenes were predicted as STS ligands . Three traditionally used polypores rich in LTTs i.e .

@highlight Three pharmacophore models were developed to identify STS inhibitors from natural sources.
@highlight SARs were derived from 18 isolated lanostane type triterpenes.
@highlight Three lanostanes were identified as first STS inhibiting natural products.
@highlight Molecular docking studies proposed crucial ligand target interactions.
