 Malignant melanoma a highly dangerous type of skin cancer is usually resistant to pro apoptosis agents such as tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand due to low death receptor expression levels . After verifying combination of chemotherapy drug paclitaxel and TRAIL could significantly enhance their anti melanoma effects we developed a liposomal melanoma target delivery system with tumor microenvironment responsiveness

@highlight The multifunctional system is tumor microenvironment responsive and active targeting.
@highlight Synergistic antitumor effect is associated with the upregulation of death receptors.
@highlight A platform that can improve the resistance of TRAIL based therapies in melanoma.
@highlight Chemotherapy drugs and biomolecules could be site specifically delivered to tumor sites.
