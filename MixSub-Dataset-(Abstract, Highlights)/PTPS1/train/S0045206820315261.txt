 Long human telomeric DNA sequence could form higher order G quadruplex structures namely telomeric multimeric G quadruplexes . The formation of telomeric multimeric G quadruplexes has been demonstrated . Several efforts have been devoted to the development of ligands targeting telomeric multimeric G quadruplexes in recent years . The reported ligands specifically targeting telomeric multimeric G quadruplexes exhibited either high anticancer activity with effective stabilization ability or distinct fluorescence responses to telomeric multimeric G quadruplexes . In this review the ligands including three types of small molecules are discussed which focus on their structural features and binding modes . Furthermore we put forward the promising prospects and current challenges . This presented review might provide new strategies to exploit more sophisticated ligands targeting telomeric multimeric G quadruplexes .
