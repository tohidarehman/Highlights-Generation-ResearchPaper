 Recent evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to chlordecone a persistent organochlorine pesticide that was used intensively in the French West Indies affects infant neurodevelopment . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between prenatal and postnatal chlordecone exposures on visual contrast sensitivity in 285 children aged from 7.1 to 8 years old in a Guadeloupean prospective birth cohort . The Freiburg Visual Acuity and Contrast Test was used to assess visual contrast sensitivity . Chlordecone concentrations were measured in blood samples at birth and in children at testing time to estimate pre and postnatal exposure respectively . Exposures were categorized into three groups and were also log transformed and considered as continuous variables . Multiple linear regression models were performed on all children taking into account various potential confounders including maternal characteristics . Potential moderation effect of sex was also examined . Results showed that higher cord plasma chlordecone levels were associated with lower contrast sensitivity . Although child chlordecone levels was not associated with the FrAcT sex specific stratified analyses revealed significant associations in boys . Associations between postnatal exposure and FrACT scores in girls were null . This study indicates that exposure to chlordecone

@highlight Children at 7 years exposed to chlordecone in Guadeloupe were enrolled.
@highlight The association between pre and postnatal chlordecone exposure and visual contrast sensitivity was examined.
@highlight Prenatal chlordecone exposure was associated with lower contrast sensitivity.
@highlight Postnatal chlordecone exposure was associated with lower contrast sensitivity but only in boys.
