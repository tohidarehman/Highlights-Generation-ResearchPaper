 Sepsis is a complex disorder with very high morbidity and mortality it can occur when an immune disorder triggers an invasion of pathogens in the host . Although many potential anti infective and immunosuppressive treatments have been reported we still do not have effective means of treating sepsis in clinic . The aim of this study is to develop a nanomaterial system that targets the site of inflammation and carries a combination of multiple drugs to better treat sepsis and alleviate its symptoms . We selected poly lactide

@highlight 3 peptide was used to target inflammated endothelial cells
@highlight and
@highlight Broad spectrum antibiotic sparfloxacin and immunosuppressant tacrolimus were concurrently loaded.
@highlight This study provides a simple and robust nanoplatform to treat lung infection induced sepsis.
