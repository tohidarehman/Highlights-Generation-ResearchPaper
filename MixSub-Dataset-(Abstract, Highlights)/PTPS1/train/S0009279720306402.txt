 The aim of the study was to synthesize a new series of benzimidazole derivatives and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of the potential cell cycle inhibition and apoptotic effects against a panel of selected human cancer cell lines along with HEK 293 human embryonic kidney cells . MTT assay was used to evaluate cytotoxic effects . Muse Cell Analyzer was used to assess cell cycle progression . Annexin V PI staining assay was used for detecting apoptosis . All the synthesized compounds showed a significant cytotoxic effect against cancer cells with the IC

@highlight New benzimidazole derivatives 15 were cytotoxic to a panel of human cancer cells.
@highlight HEK 293 embriyonic kidney cells were much less susceptible to compound 5.
@highlight Bromo derivatived compound 5 induced apoptosis in all tested cancer cells.
@highlight Compound 5 induced G
@highlight  M arrest which was modulated by a p53 independent mechanism.
