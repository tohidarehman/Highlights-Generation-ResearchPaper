 In continuation of our previous work on the investigation of CDK9 inhibitors bearing indole moiety for the discovery of novel anticancer agents novel methylenehydrazine 1 carboxamide derivatives with pyrimidin 2 yl amino 1

@highlight Novel methylenehydrazine 1 carboxamide derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight  and
@highlight inhibited the CDK9 dependent HIV 1 transcription.
@highlight  and
@highlight blocked the phosphorylation function of kinase CDK9.
@highlight exhibited both good anticancer activity and low toxicity to normal cells.
@highlight significantly induced apoptosis in cancer cells.
@highlight Dock studies implied that
@highlight had a good binding affinity with CDK9.
