 Herein we report the identification design and synthesis of a series of 4 substituted 2 amino 3 4 dihydroquinazolines with hairpin turn side chains as novel inhibitors of BACE 1 . The dihydroquinazoline derivatives were rationally designed by modifying the amide group and relocating the hydrophobic substituent on the hairpin turn side chain of lead compound

@highlight A novel class of dihydroquinazolines was designed and synthesized to inhibit BACE1.
@highlight Key strategy Relocating the hairpin side chain hydrophobic moiety to position C4 on dihydroquinazolines.
@highlight Compound
