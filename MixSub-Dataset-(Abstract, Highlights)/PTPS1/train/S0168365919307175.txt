 The combination therapy as an emerging strategy for improved clinical efficacy of cancer therapy may not achieve effective response owing to the lack of highly selective and efficient tumor targeting . Herein a dual stimuli guided chemo magnetothermal combination therapy system based upon histamine dodecyl carbamate coated doxorubicin magnetite loaded solid lipid nanoparticles was developed for enhanced anticancer effects . Taking advantage of the dual pH

@highlight A dual stimuli guided chemo magnetothermal combination therapy system was developed.

@highlight  induced electrostatic and magnetic guidance highly enhanced cellular drug uptake.
@highlight Dual stimuli mediated guidance improved the anticancer ability.
@highlight Targetable combination therapy is required to inhibit the growth of large tumors.
