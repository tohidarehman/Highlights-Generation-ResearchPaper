 Due to the lack of effective pharmacotherapy options to treats Alzheimers disease new strategies have been approached in the search for multi target molecules as therapeutic options . In this work four indole alkaloids geissoschizoline geissoschizone geissospermine and 3 4 5 6 tetradehydrogeissospermine were isolated from

@highlight Geissoschizoline is a potent inhibitor of both humans AChE and BChE.
@highlight Geissoschizoline plays a promising anti inflammatory role.
@highlight It reduces the microglial release of NO and TNF .
@highlight It shows mixed type inhibition mechanism interacts with AS and PAS sites of enzyme.
@highlight Geissoschizoline behaves as dual site inhibitor.
