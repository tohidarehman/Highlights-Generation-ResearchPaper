 A docking study of a novel series of benzofuran derivatives with ER was conducted . In this study we report the synthesis of a novel series of benzofuran derivatives and evaluation of their anticancer activity

@highlight A novel series of benzofuran derivatives were designed and synthesized through structural modification of raloxifene.
@highlight The benzofuran derivatives were evaluated for the anticancer activity
@highlight against breast cancer cell lines.
@highlight A target compound has exhibited excellent anti oestrogen receptor dependent breast cancer cell lines activities and low toxicity.
