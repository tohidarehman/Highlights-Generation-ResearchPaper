 Chelating Cu from tumors has been verified as an effective and promising strategy for cancer therapy through antiangiogenesis . However systematic removal Cu by injecting with Cu chelators will result unavoidable side effects since Cu is indispensable to the body . In this work a micelle targeting to tumors newborn vessels based on a polypeptide was developed to co load DOX and Probe X which can go through an OFF to ON procedure to report the Cu

@highlight A theranostic specific Cu
@highlight chelator was proposed.
@highlight Targeting micelle co loaded with Cu
@highlight  chelator and chemotherapeutic reagents was fabricated.
@highlight Antiangiogenesis and tumor s oxygen saturation reduction were reduced.
@highlight Fine antitumor efficacy was achieved with low side effect.
