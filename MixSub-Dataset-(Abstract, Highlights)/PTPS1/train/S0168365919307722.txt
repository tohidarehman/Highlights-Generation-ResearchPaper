 Induction of memory T cell response is inefficient in colorectal cancer liver metastasis following existing therapies due to abundant stroma and immunosuppressive environment within the metastatic liver which leads to fast disease progression high recurrence rate and short survival . Two fundamental steps are involved to elicit extensive memory T cell response stimulation of naive T cells with robust and persistent antigen signals and maintenance of differentiated memory T cells with survival factors . Here we demonstrate a rational design of triple combination regimen including relaxin FOLFOX and IL 12 successfully stimulates central memory T cells and achieves long term survival in an aggressive experimental CRC liver metastasis model . Sequential administration of FOLFOX and IL 12 gene therapy following stromal deactivation by RLN gene therapy completely cured established CRC liver metastases in 50 of mice and provided long lasting protection against tumor recurrence . The study here may highlight the potential of evoking memory response as a curative therapy for the treatment of CRC liver metastasis .
