 Heavy metals are considered to be among the leading environmental factors that trigger amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . However no convincing biopathological mechanism and therapeutic clinical implication of such metals in ALS pathogenesis have been established . This is partly attributable to the technical and scientific difficulties in demonstrating a direct and causative role of heavy metals in the onset of ALS in patients . However a body of epidemiological clinical and experimental evidences suggest that lead more than other metals could actually play a major role in the onset and progression of ALS . Here to clarify the nature of the association and the causative role of Pb in ALS we comprehensively reviewed the scientific literature of the last decade with objective database searches and the methods typically adopted in systematic reviews critically analysing and summarising the various scientifically sound evidence on the relationship between ALS and Pb . From these tasks we noted a number of multidisciplinary associations between ALS and Pb and specifically the importance of occupational exposure to Pb in ALS development and or progression . We also report the possible involvement of TAR DNA binding protein based molecular mechanism in Pb mediated ALS although these data rely on a single study which included both

@highlight A multidisciplinary update of the ALS Pb relation was conducted by databases search.
@highlight Epidemiological clinical and experimental evidences reported ALS Pb relationships.
@highlight Pb promotes TDP 43 aggregation and inclusion.
@highlight Pb targeted therapies and policies are highly encouraged in the fight against ALS.
