 Tumor hypoxia has been widely explored over the years as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker . Herein we designed optimized and synthesized a new multifunctional bioreductive linker

@highlight A novel multifunctional bioreductive linker based on 2 nitroimidazole was designed and synthesized.
@highlight Its application in SN 38 prodrug design was proven to be successful.
@highlight Preliminary screening for reduction mediated cleavage and specific hypoxia cytotoxity.
