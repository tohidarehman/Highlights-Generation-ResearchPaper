 Despite their notorious adverse effects glucocorticoids are used extensively in clinical management of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases . To achieve a sustained therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicities macromolecular GC prodrugs have been developed with promising outcomes for the treatment of RA . Fine tuning the activation kinetics of these prodrugs may further improve their therapeutic efficacy and minimize the off target adverse effects . To assess the feasibility of this strategy five different dexamethasone containing monomers with distinctively different linker chemistries were designed synthesized and copolymerized with

@highlight Synthesis of polymeric dexamethasone prodrugs with different linker chemistry.
@highlight The prodrugs demonstrated a wide spectrum of activation kinetics
@highlight The prodrugs exhibit different efficacy in preserving arthritic joint
@highlight The prodrug activation mechanism is critical for its therapeutic efficacy.
