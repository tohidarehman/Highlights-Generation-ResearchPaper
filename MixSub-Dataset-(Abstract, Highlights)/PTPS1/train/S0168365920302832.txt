 Supramolecular chemotherapy is currently a new strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy as well as overcome the side effects of traditional chemotherapy . Herein a supramolecular chemotherapy platform based on the pegylated guanidinium modified calixarene pentadodecyl ether nanoassembly was prepared . Three commercially available antitumor drugs oxaliplatin methotrexate and chlorambucil all showed strong binding to this GC5A 12C nanocarrier . The supramolecular nanodrugs achieved higher anticancer performances compared with free drugs in cell experiments . Furthermore the cellular uptake mechanisms and efficacy are confirmed by fluorescence imaging .

@highlight A host guest drug delivery nanosystem is fabricated for supramolecular chemotherapy.
@highlight The GC5A 12C nanocarrier as a universal platform can load various drugs via the host guest complexation.
@highlight GC5A 12C nanocarriers drug loading and encapsulation efficiency are higher than liposomes due to host guest interactions
@highlight GC5A 12C nanocarriers promote the cellular uptake of drugs leading to higher cytotoxicity to cancer cells than free drug.
