 Fibrin gels have been extensively used for three dimensional cell culture bleeding control and molecular and cell therapies because the fibrous networks facilitate biomolecular and cell transport . However a small window for gelation makes it difficult to handle the gels for desired preparation and transport . Several methods developed to control gelation rates often alter the microstructure thereby affecting the mechanical response . We hypothesized that a particle designed to discharge thrombin cargos in response to an external stimulus such as H
