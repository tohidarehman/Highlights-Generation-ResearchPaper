 CoQ10 and Vitamin E are used in medicinal applications but they are both lipophilic molecules and the poor solubility in aqueous media results in an inefficient administration poor bioavailability and potential toxicity . A mixed conjugate Ubiquinol Polyethylene glycol Vitamin E was synthesized and characterized to improve the bioavailability of CoQ10 and Vitamin E. The synthesized mixed PEG conjugate was characterized by
