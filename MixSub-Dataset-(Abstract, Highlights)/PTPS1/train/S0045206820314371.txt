 Cyclooxygenase 2 is one of the prominent enzymes to cause an increased production of prostaglandins during inflammation and immune responses . Cyclooxygenase 2 expression is up regulated in inflammatory conditions owing to the induction by different inflammatory stimuli including cytokines and therefore the expression studies of cyclooxygenase 2 in lipopolysaccharide induced macrophage cells could be used for screening of the compounds with anti inflammatory potential . The present study evaluated the anti inflammatory properties of four homologous stomopneulactones A D classified under the class of macrocyclic lactones isolated from the solvent extract of the long spined sea urchin

@highlight Four stomopneulactones A D were isolated from sea urchin
@highlight Stomopneulactone D displayed dual inhibition against inflammatory COX 2 and 5 LOX.
@highlight Molecular docking simulation showed enzyme ligand interaction in inflammation model.
@highlight Stomopneulactone D attenuated mRNA expression of COX 2 in LPS activated macrophages.
@highlight Stomopneulactone D arrested forming cytokines and reactive oxygen nitrogen species.
@highlight Stomopneulactones could be potential therapeutic leads against inflammation.
