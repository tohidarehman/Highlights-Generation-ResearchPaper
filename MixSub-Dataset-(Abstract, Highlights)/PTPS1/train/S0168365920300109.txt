 Supramolecular peptide materials have attracted increasing attention due to their natural biological origin and versatile applications . However it is often challenging to control and modulate the self assembly of peptides for constructing hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties and adaptive injectability toward biomedical applications . Here we report a supramolecular strategy for forming robust and injectable hydrogels based on the self assembly of a rationally designed bola dipeptide . The self assembled hydrogels exhibit versatile functionalities including flow under shear stress good recovery properties and easy encapsulation of hydrophilic prodrugs . The prodrug loaded hydrogels show sustained release profiles inhibited nontargeted leakage and enhanced localized prodrug conversion leading to highly efficient photodynamic tumor ablation . Hence the supramolecular strategy is promising for the rational construction of injectable hydrogels toward targeted and sustained prodrug conversion and tumor therapy .
