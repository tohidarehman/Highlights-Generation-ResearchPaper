 The selenoprotein thioredoxin reductases have been extensively studied as a potential target for the development of anticancer drugs . Herein we designed synthesized and evaluated a series of coumarin chalcone hybrids as TrxR inhibitors . Most of them exhibited enhancing anticancer activity than Xanthohumol

@highlight A new series of coumarin chalcone hybrids were developed as TrxR inhibitors for anticancer agents.
@highlight exhibited potent antitumor activity against HCT116 cells
@highlight featured red fluorescence and could be imaged in cells.
@highlight increased cancer cell ROS accumulation and induced apoptosis.
@highlight inhibited HCT116 cells migration and colony formation.
