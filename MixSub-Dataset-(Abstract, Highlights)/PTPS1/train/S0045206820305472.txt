 In our attempt to discover effective anticancer agents three series of novel quinazoline based compounds have been designed synthesized and tested as VEGFR 2 inhibitors . Five quinazoline 2 carboxamide derivatives

@highlight Twenty seven novel quinazoline derivatives were designed synthesized and biologically evaluated.
@highlight Inhibitory activities of all derivatives were evaluated toward VEGFR 2 kinase at 10M concentration.
@highlight Calculate the IC
@highlight values for the promising candidates which exhibited VEGFR 2 inhibition percent above 90 .
@highlight In vitro antiproliferative activity assay against NCI 60 cell line panel.
@highlight Docking study and Field alignment technique were performed to interpret and understand the biological evaluation results.
