 Glutathione S transferases are a key enzyme superfamily involved in the detoxification and cytoprotection of a wide variety of xenobiotics such as carcinogens anticancer drugs environmental toxicants and endogenously produced free radicals . In the liver the hGSTA1 isoenzyme is the most abundant and catalyzes the glutathione conjugation of a wide range of electrophiles and has been the principal GST responsible for xenobiotic detoxification . Given the critical role of this enzyme in several cellular processes particularly cell detoxification understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of

@highlight  NF treatment resulted in increased hGSTA1 activity in HepG2 cells.
@highlight NFmediated induction of hGSTA1 expression is at transcriptional level.
@highlight NFmediated induction of hGSTA1 is AHR dependent.
@highlight AHR activation promotes its recruitment to the
@highlight gene promoter.
