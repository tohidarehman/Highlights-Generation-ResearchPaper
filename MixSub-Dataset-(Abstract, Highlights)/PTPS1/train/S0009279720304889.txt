 The present study analyzed whether melatonin could mediate the expression of VEGF IL 6 and TNF as well as the apoptotic index in rats with diabetic retinopathy . Fifty Wistar albino rats were divided into the following groups GC rats without induction of diabetes by streptozotocin GD rats induced to diabetes by streptozotocin and treated with placebo GDM rats induced to diabetes by streptozotocin and after confirmation treated with melatonin at a dose of 10mg kg for 20 days GDMS rats induced to diabetes by streptozotocin and treated simultaneously with melatonin at a dosage of 10mg kg for 20 days GDI rats induced to diabetes by streptozotocin and after confirmation treated with insulin for 20 days . Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin and insulin was administered subcutaneously . For apoptosis TUNEL was used while for the analysis of VEGF IL 6 and TNF . The results showed that the groups that were treated with melatonin decreased the expression of cytokines and VEGF in addition to apoptosis . Thus it is concluded that melatonin can regulate the expression of these factors by improving the condition of the retina in diabetic retinopathy .

@highlight Melatonin mitigates the adverse effects of diabetic retinopathy.
@highlight Melatonin reduced inflammatory cytokines in the retina of rats with diabetes.
@highlight Melatonin is a good alternative in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
