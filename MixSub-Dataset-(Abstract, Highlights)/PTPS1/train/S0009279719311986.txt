 Quinolinic acid known as a neuro active metabolite associated with the kynurenine pathway . At high concentrations QA is often involved in the initiation and development of several human neurologic diseases like Alzheimer s disease . Because of the QA action as the NMDA receptor it is considered as a potent excitotoxin

@highlight Quinolinic acid QA known as a neuro active metabolite.
@highlight QA strongly accelerate Tau amyloid oligomerization.
@highlight Electrostatic interactions accompanied by hydrogen bonding guarantee relatively tight binding of QA to the protein.
@highlight Regarding elevated concentrations of both QA and Tau it is very likely that QA contribute to the NFT formation.
