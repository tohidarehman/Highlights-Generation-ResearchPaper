 Pyridazinone analogues have been known to be potential candidates for anticonvulsant agents . We have identified several pyridazinone based anticonvulsant agents . As a continuation to our previous research a series of hybrid pyridazinone thiazole connected through amide linkage were designed and synthesized . Among these compound SP 5F demonstrated significant anticonvulsant activity with median effective dose of 24.38mg kg and 88.23mg kg . Results of GABA estimation showed a marked increase in the GABA level when compared with control . Molecular docking studies at the active site of GABA receptor further confirmed the GABA modulatory effects of SP 5F .

@highlight In continuation of our previous studies on pyridazinone analogues as anticonvulsant a series of hybrid thiazole pyridazinone analogues were synthesized as anticonvulsants.
@highlight Among all eighteen synthesized compounds 2 3 4 chlorophenyl 6 oxo 5 6 dihydropyridazin 1 4
@highlight  yl N thiazol 2 yl acetamide 
@highlight  emerged as the most potent and safer anticonvulsant agent acting through GABA mediated mechanism.
@highlight pharmacophoric pattern and drug likeness studies showed that all the compounds fulfill the requirements which are crucial to be a potent anticonvulsant drug.
@highlight Further molecular docking studies on the validated target protein substantiate the binding pattern of the ligand as hypothesized by the pharmacophore pattern. Thus hybrid thiazole pyridazinonesmay lead to
