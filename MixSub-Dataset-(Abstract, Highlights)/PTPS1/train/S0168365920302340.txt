 Accurate identification of surgical margins for malignancy remains a challenge in the surgical therapy of cancer and this encountered interoperative difficulties which directly contribute to the prognosis of patients . In recent years indocyanine green has been approved and applied in clinical settings for lesions detection especially for the precise surgical resection . However rapid clearance and poor stability greatly limit its clinical practicality . Herein a super stable homogeneous iodinated formulation technology is designed to realize sufficient dispersion of ICG into lipiodol for transcatheter embolization synergistic fluorescence guided resection . Particularly SHIFTs is prepared in a green physical mixture

@highlight Superstable homogeneous iodinated formulation technology SHIFT is a green physical method without carrier introduction.
@highlight A novel lipiodol ICG formula named SHIFTs shows an enhanced FL PT PA capacity.
@highlight The SHIFT formulation can embolize the primary liver tumors thoroughly.
@highlight A platform integrates embolization and fluorescent guided surgical resection in HCC.
