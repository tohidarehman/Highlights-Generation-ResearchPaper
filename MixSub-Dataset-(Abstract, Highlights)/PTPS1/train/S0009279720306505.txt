 The development of fast acting antidepressants is crucial considering that conventional antidepressants require a long period to elicit therapeutic effects . Creatine an ergogenic guanidine like compound stands out as a candidate to exert fast antidepressant like responses . The present study investigated whether a single dose of creatine elicits a fast response in mice submitted to the novelty suppressed feeding test a paradigm that may assess depression like and anxiety like behaviors . Ketamine an NMDA receptor antagonist that has rapid antidepressant effects and conventional antidepressants were also tested . The involvement of the mTORC1 signaling pathway in the behavioral responses was also investigated . Biochemical analyses included hippocampal BDNF level and total and phospho mTORC1 Ser

@highlight Conventional antidepressants did not show fast behavioral effect in the NSF test.
@highlight Creatine and ketamine presented rapid behavioral effect in the NSF test via mTORC1.
@highlight The increase on BDNF levels evoked by creatine and ketamine is dependent on mTORC1.
@highlight Ketamine promoted mTORC1 dependent hippocampal synaptic protein translation.
