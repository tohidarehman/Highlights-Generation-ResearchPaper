 Stimuli responsive nano assemblies are emerging as promising drug delivery systems with spatial and temporal tenability which can undergo structural transition for controlled drug release upon excitation by either exogenous or endogenous stimuli . Particularly exogenous stimuli responsive nano assemblies based remotely controlled DDSs have received much attention due to their accuracy and reliability realized by tunable exogenous triggers such as light magnetic field or temperature . In this review we will briefly introduce the current state of the art technologies of nano assembly synthesis and summarize the recent advances in remotely controlled nano assembly based DDSs activated by different exogenous stimuli or endogenous exogenous dual stimuli . Furthermore the pioneering progress in bio cleanable stimuli responsive nano assemblies that holds great relevance to clinical translation will be described . Finally we will conclude with our perspectives on current issues and future development of this field . The objective of this review is to outline current advances of nano assemblies as remotely controlled DDSs in hopes of accelerating the future development of intelligent nanomedicines .
