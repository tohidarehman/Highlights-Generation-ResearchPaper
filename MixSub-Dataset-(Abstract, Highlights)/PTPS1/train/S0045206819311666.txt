 In an approach to develop potent cytotoxic compounds with targeted action a systematic methodology was employed to design and initially synthesize parent compounds

@highlight Four variants of benzene sulphonamides A1 A14 were designed synthesized and characterized analytically.
@highlight Compounds were excellent anti proliferative agents tested against four cancer cell lines.
@highlight Apoptotic mechanisms were exemplified in DU 145 cells by various mechanistic studies.
@highlight Compounds A2 was the most potent compound of the series.
@highlight Structure activity relationships were established.
