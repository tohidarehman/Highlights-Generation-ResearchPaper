 The rise of drug resistance has made the deserted clinical requirement to improve of new classes of antibiotics agents . The development of antibacterial agents with the novel method of activity stays a high need worldwide . The treatment of bacterial infections remains a test in light of developing irresistible sicknesses and the expanding number of multidrug resistance microbial pathogens . Therefore there is a need for powerful activities to think of new successful therapeutic agents and it is dire to find novel synthetic analogs against bacterial targets . The improvements of new less harmful minimum side effort and extremely dynamic sulfonyl or sulfonamide bearing analogs are hot research topics in medicinal chemistry . This present review summarizes the current innovations of sulfonyl or sulfonamide based derivatives with potential antibacterial activities against various Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains and discussing its various aspects of structure activity relationship .

@highlight Sulfonyl or sulfonamide based derivatives exhibited potential antibacterial activities.
@highlight Detailed explanation of structureactivity relationships SAR .
@highlight EDGs and EWGs play a key role in increasing antibacterial activities.
@highlight Rational design and development of Sulfonyl or sulfonamide based hybrids against multidrug resistant bacteria.
