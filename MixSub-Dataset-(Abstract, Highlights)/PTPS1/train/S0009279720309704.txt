 Flavonoids are natural products widely recognized for their plurality of applications such as antiviral antiproliferative antitumor activities and antioxidant properties . The flavanone naringenin is presented in citrus fruits and has been studied to combat recurrent diseases that still lack effective treatment . Research groups have been investing efforts to the development of new safe and active candidates to combat these agents or conditions and despite good results recently reported against the Zika virus and tumor cells the use of citrus naringenin is limited due to its low bioavailability . Structural exchanges through functionalization for example attaching lipophilic groups instead of hydroxyl groups can further enhance biological properties .

@highlight Synthesis and characterization of both lipophilic ethers and esters of the citrus naringenin a natural product.
@highlight Regioselective preparation of 7 
@highlight  alkyl ethers.
@highlight Inhibitory activities against Zika virus and proliferative cells of Melanoma and breast cancer cells.
@highlight The lipophilic ethers present the ability to inhibit selectively ZIKV replication in human cells and inhibitions.
@highlight Modifications in flavonoid molecules could be further explore in the future development of specific anti ZIKV compounds.
