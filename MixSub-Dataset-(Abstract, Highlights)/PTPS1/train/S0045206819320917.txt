 Inhibitors of poly polymerase 1 have shown to be promising in clinical trials against cancer and many researchers are interested in the development of new PARP 1 inhibitors . Herein we designed and synthesized 44 novel erythrina derivatives bearing a 1 2 3 triazole moiety as PARP 1 inhibitors . MTT assay results indicated that compound

@highlight Erythrina derivatives bearing a 1 2 3 triazole moiety as PARP 1 inhibitors had been synthesized.
@highlight Compound
@highlight exhibited the most potent activity against A549 cells.
@highlight Compound
@highlight was apoptosis induced by the mitochondrial pathway.
@highlight Compound
@highlight had more potential research value as a novel PARP 1 inhibitor.
