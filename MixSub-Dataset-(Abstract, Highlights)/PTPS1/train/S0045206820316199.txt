 Lung fibroblasts play major roles in the lung repair fibrosis process through synthesis and remodeling of extracellular matrix . Those aberrant activations and elevated proliferations are associated with several fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Targeting fibroblasts is a promising approach for preventing aberrant remodeling of lung architecture and protect irreversible pulmonary fibrosis . In this study we developed an aptamer that can target lung fibroblasts and explored its potential as a delivery vehicle of cytotoxic agents intracellularly . The aptamer was discovered from artificial nucleic acid libraries through cell based systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment . This indole modified aptamer can bind to LL97A cells a fibroblast cell line derived from IPF patients with high affinity

@highlight First identification of cell internalising artificial nucleic acid aptamers for lung fibroblasts.
@highlight Pre screening revealed that indole modification was proper for cell internalising aptamer selection.
@highlight Artificial aptamer drug conjugate technology could be a useful platform for lung fibrosis therapy.
