 Binding of toxic ligands to DNA could result in undesirable biological processes such as carcinogenesis or mutagenesis . Binding mode of Abiraterone a steroid drug and calf thymus DNA was investigated in this study using fluorescence and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy . The probable prediction of binding and the type of interaction forces involved in the arrangement between ABR and ctDNA were explored through spectroscopic and molecular docking studies . The results indicated that ABR binds to the ctDNA in the minor groove . The binding constants were in the range of 1.3510

@highlight Binding interaction of abiraterone with calf thymus DNA ctDNA has been studied.
@highlight Thermodynamic studies suggest hydrophobic interactions dominates the binding interaction.
@highlight Groove binding between dapoxetine and ctDNA was observed.
@highlight FTIR and CD spectral studies were conducted to establish any conformational changes in ctDNA.
@highlight Molecular docking suggested non intercalated interaction with the narrow minor groove binding.
