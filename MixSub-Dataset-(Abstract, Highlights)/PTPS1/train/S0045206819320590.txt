 Enterococci are gram positive widespread nosocomial pathogens that in recent years have developed resistance to various commonly employed antibiotics . Since finding new infection control agents based on secondary metabolites from organisms has proved successful for decades natural products are potentially useful sources of compounds with activity against enterococci . Herein are reported the results of a natural product library screening based on a whole cell assay against a gram positive model organism which led to the isolation of a series of anacardic acids identified by analysis of their spectroscopic data and by chemical derivatizations . Merulinic acid C was identified as the most active anacardic acid derivative obtained against antibiotic resistant enterococci . Fluorescence microscopy analyses showed that merulinic acid C targets the bacterial membrane without affecting the peptidoglycan and causes rapid cellular ATP leakage from cells . Merulinic acid C was shown to be synergistic with gentamicin against
