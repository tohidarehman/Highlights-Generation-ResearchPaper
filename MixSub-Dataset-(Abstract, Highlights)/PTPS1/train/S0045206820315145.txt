 Overexpressing myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 protein is an important way to confer the resistance of cancer cells to conventional anti cancer treatments . Therefore developing Mcl 1 inhibitors has become an attractive strategy for cancer therapy . In the studies a series of new indazole acylsulfonamide hybrids were designed synthesized and evaluated as potent Mcl 1 inhibitors . Among them the most potent compound

@highlight Indazole acylsulfonamide hybrids as Mcl 1 inhibitors were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Compound 17 showed good selectivity for Mcl 1 over Bcl 2 and Bcl xL.
@highlight Compound 17 effectively induced apoptosis and activated caspase 3 in K562 cells.
