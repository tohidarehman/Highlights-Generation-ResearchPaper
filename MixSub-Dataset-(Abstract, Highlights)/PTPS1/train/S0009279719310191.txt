 Environmental pollutant Lead is known to induce neurotoxicity in human . The central nervous system is the most vulnerable to the minute levels of Pb induced toxicity . Pb has been linked to Alzheimer s disease as a probable risk factor as it shows epigenetic and developmental link associated with Alzheimer s disease like pathology . Beta amyloid peptides were considered as the crucial factors in the beta amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer s disease brain . In this context we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the development of Pb induced Alzheimer s disease in in vitro . Previous data from our studies have reported that Pb in the presence of beta Amyloid peptide and induces more apoptosis than individual exposures . Here to further evaluate the molecular mechanism underlying Pb induced Alzheimer s disease we focussed on the involvement of calcium signalling in inducing cell death . Our experimental observations suggesting that Pb in the presence of beta amyloid peptide alters intracellular calcium levels which leads to the increased beta secretase activity which further promotes the generation of beta amyloid peptides . It also showed depression in the levels of GAP 43 expression inhibition of PKC activity and altering synaptic activity further leads to cell death .

@highlight Depletion in the levels of calcium ions could play a vital role in inducing cell death in Lead involved Alzheimer s disease.
@highlight Lead enhances the molecular aggregation of beta amyloid peptides invitro.
@highlight Lead in the presence of amyloid peptides inhibits neuronal outgrowth by inactivating GAP 43.
