 Pancreatic cancer is highly metastatic with very short survival and increasing mortality rates . Recent advances in therapeutic regimes and other adjuvant therapies improved slightly overall survival of pancreatic cancer but fighting metastasis has been challenging and is necessary for achieving cure . Nanomedicine not limited to drug delivery offers opportunities for targeting cancer metastasis . Research regarding the prevention of metastasis of this malignancy is highly demanded . Herein we focus on advances of nanomedicine based strategies for targeting different stages of metastasis including cancer stem cells tumor microenvironment circulating tumor cells and tumor exosomes . A greater emphasis on targeting metastasis of pancreatic cancer using nanomedicine based strategies provides avenues for improving pancreatic cancer treatment outcomes in the future .

@highlight Pancreatic cancer is highly metastatic but nanomedicine offered opportunities for fighting against metastasis.
@highlight Targeting cancer stem cells in the first place is important for preventing metastasis spread.
@highlight Remodeling the tumor microenvironment is preferable for intratumoral delivery of chemotherapeutics.
@highlight Targeting circulating tumor cells is a feasible strategy for preventing metastatic colony formation
@highlight Targeting oncogenic exosomes using specific markers may also to prevent metastasis of PDAC
