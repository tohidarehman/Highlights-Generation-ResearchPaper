 Quorum sensing is a density dependent form of cell cell communication that triggers the functional coordination of cooperative behaviors such as the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation . Quorum quenching refers to all processes involved in the disruption of QS and is regarded as a promising strategy for treating bacterial infections . Herein four compounds with closely related chemical structures to homoserine lactone were synthesized and fully characterized . The compounds are termed TGK series compounds . These compounds were subsequently tested in their QS inhibition activity using an

@highlight Four TGK series compounds related to homoserine lactone were synthesized and fully characterized.
@highlight TGK series compounds inhibit quorum sensing activity in a AHL regulated
