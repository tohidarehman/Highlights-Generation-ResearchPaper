 The monoterpenoid terpinen 4 ol is known to inhibit cell excitability has low toxicity and important pharmacological activities which are likely related to neural excitability such as anti inflammatory antiepileptic and antinociceptive effects . However the pharmacological characteristics and mechanisms underlying the effects of 4TERP on blockade of neural action potential are not completely elucidated . Since Na

@highlight 4TERP concentration dependently inhibits voltage dependent Na
@highlight channels activation.
@highlight 4TERP inhibits I
@highlight predominantly through the mechanism of channel pore blockade.
@highlight 4TERP blockade showed sensitivity to use dependence.
@highlight This effect is coherent with 4TERP induced blockade of neuronal excitability.
