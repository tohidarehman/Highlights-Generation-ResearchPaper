 Pulmonary delivery of protein drugs into the systemic circulation is highly desirable as the lung provides a large absorption surface area and a more favorable environment for biologics compared to other delivery routes . However pulmonary systemic delivery of proteins presents several challenges such as poor protein stability and limited bioavailability especially for large proteins which exhibit an average bioavailability of 1 to 5 when delivered

@highlight Delivery of large proteins
@highlight inhalation has been limited due to their low bioavailability through the pulmonary route.
