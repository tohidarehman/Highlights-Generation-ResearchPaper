 PI3K has proved to be an effective target for anti lymphoma drugs . However the application of current approved PI3K inhibitors has been greatly limited due to their specific immune mediated toxicity and increased risk of infection it is necessary to develop more PI3K inhibitors with new scaffold . In this study SAR study with respect to piperazinone containing purine derivatives led to the discovery of a potent and selective PI3K inhibitor 4 1 2 2 ethyl 1

@highlight was a potent and selective PI3K inhibitor with piperazinone containing purine scaffold.
@highlight could induce cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit the phosphorylation of PI3K downstream components in NHL cell lines.
@highlight exhibited anti NHL activity in vitro and in vivo.
