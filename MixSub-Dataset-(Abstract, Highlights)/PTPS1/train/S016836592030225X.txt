 Daily injections for basal insulin therapy are far from ideal resulting in hypo hyperglycemic episodes associated with fatal complications in type 1 diabetes patients . Here we report a delivery system that provides controlled release of insulin closely mimicking physiological basal insulin requirement for an extended period following a single subcutaneous injection . Stability of insulin was significantly improved by formation of zinc insulin hexamers further stabilized by electrostatic complex formation with chitosan polymer . Insulin complexes were homogenously incorporated into PLA PEG PLA a biodegradable thermogel copolymer that instantaneously forms a subcutaneous gel depot following injection . Chitosan polymer was hydrophobically modified using oleic acid prior to complex formation with insulin to enable distribution of oleic acid grafted chitosanzinc insulin complexes into the hydrophobic core of PLA PEG PLA thermogel copolymer micelles .
