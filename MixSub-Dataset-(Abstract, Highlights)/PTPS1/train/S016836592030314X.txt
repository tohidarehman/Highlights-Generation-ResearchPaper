 Fibroblast growth factor 21 is a hormone like protein that improves blood glucose and lipid metabolism . However its short half life and instability are bottlenecks to its clinical applications . In this study to extend its pharmacological action we created a stabilized mutant FGF21 and then genetically fused it with human albumin

@highlight A mutant FGF21 analogue and an albumin fusion HSA mFGF21 product was produced.
@highlight The half life of HSA mFGF21 was 20 times longer than that for FGF21.
@highlight HSA mFGF21 showed a sustained adipose tissue distribution compared to FGF21.
@highlight HSA mFGF21 continuously suppressed blood glucose levels in diabetic mice.
@highlight HSA mFGF21 ameliorated the abnormalities of adipose tissue in diabetic mice.
