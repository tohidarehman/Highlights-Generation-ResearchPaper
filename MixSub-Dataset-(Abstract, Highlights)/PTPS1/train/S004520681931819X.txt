 Herein we describe a synthesis of new isoxazole containing 5 mRNA cap analogues via a cycloaddition reaction . The obtained analogues show a capability to inhibit cap dependent translation

@highlight A new series of isoxazole containing 5 cap mRNA analogs were synthesized.
@highlight The isoxazole ring was obtained
@highlight 1 3 bipolar cycloaddition reaction.
@highlight Tested compounds appeared to be effective inhibitors of translation.
@highlight The molecular docking of synthesized compounds revealed a unique protein binding mode.
