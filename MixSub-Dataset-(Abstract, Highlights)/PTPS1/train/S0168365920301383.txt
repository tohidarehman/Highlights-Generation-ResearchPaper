 The rapid dissemination of life threatening multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens calls for the development of new antibacterial agents and alternative strategies . The virulence factor secreted by bacteria plays a crucial role in the sophisticated processes during infections . Inspired by the unique capacity of many bacteria inducing clotting of plasma to initiate colonization we propose a programmable antibiotic delivery system for precision therapy using methicillin resistant

@highlight Programmable antibiotic delivery system PMS to combat MRSA.
@highlight High selectivity and efficacy of PMS for antibacterial therapy.
@highlight Sequential triggered release system exhibiting high selectivity to distinguish live MRSA from dead ones.
