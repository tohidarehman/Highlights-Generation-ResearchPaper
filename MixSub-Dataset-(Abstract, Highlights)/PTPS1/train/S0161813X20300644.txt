 Cisplatin is a platinum chemotherapy drug that can cause the side effect of ototoxicity and hearing loss . The monofunctional platinum complexes phenanthriplatin and pyriplatin have recently been investigated as anti cancer agents but their side effects are largely unknown . Here we used the auditory hybridoma cell line HEI OC1 to investigate the ototoxicity of cisplatin phenanthriplatin and pyriplatin . The effect of these compounds against cellular viability on reactive oxygen species production mitochondrial membrane polarization caspase 3 7 activity DNA integrity and caspase 12 expression were measured using spectrophotometric flow cytometric and blot analyses . We found that the monofunctional complexes and cisplatin decreased cellular viability . All three compounds increased ROS yield at 24h but at 48h ROS levels returned to normal . Also the compounds did not depolarize the mitochondrial membrane . All three compounds reduced caspase 3 7 activity at 24h cisplatin increased caspase 3 7 activity and caused apoptosis at 48h . Caspase 12 expression was associated with all three compounds . In summary the monofunctional complexes may cause ototoxicity like cisplatin . Phenanthriplatin and pyriplatin may cause ototoxicity initially by inducing ROS production but they may also signal through distinct apoptotic pathways that do not integrate caspases 3 7 or may act at different time points in the same pathways .

@highlight Cisplatin phenanthriplatin and pyriplatin reduced HEI OC1 cell viability.
@highlight ROS increased in cells at 24h but returned to control levels at 48h.
@highlight The three compounds did not alter mitochondrial membrane potentials.
@highlight Only cisplatin caused increased caspase 3 7 activity and late stage apoptosis.
@highlight The compounds had associated caspase 12 expression but this may be endogenous.
