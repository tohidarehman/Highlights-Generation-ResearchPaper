 Aurora B plays critical role in the process of chromosome condensation and chromosome orientation during the regulation of mitosis . The overexpression of Aurora B has been observed in several tumor types . As a part of our ongoing effort to develop Aurora B inhibitors herein we described the design synthesis and evaluation of phenyl pyridine diazepine analogs . The diazepane aniline pyrimidine

@highlight Phenyl pyridine diazepine derived Aurora B inhibitors have been designed synthesized and its inhabitation properties were studied.
@highlight Among the synthesized compounds 8 fluorobenzodiazepine
@highlight was identified with a single digit nM potency towards Aurora B IC
@highlight 8nM .
@highlight Antiproliferation assay for
@highlight showed activity across the cell lines with IC
@highlight of 0.575 0.422 and 0.698M for MCF 7 MDA MB 231 and SkoV3 respectively.
@highlight PK profile of
@highlight has shown higher bioavailability 73 along with good exposure AUC of 1360ng.h mL .
