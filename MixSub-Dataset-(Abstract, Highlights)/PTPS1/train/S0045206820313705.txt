 In this study we synthesized a series of sixteen bispyridines starting from 2 6 diaminopyridine and various aromatic aldehydes and evaluated their antioxidant antibacterial antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity . The chemical structures were elucidated by FTIR elemental analysis ESR and HRMS .

@highlight Bis imino pyridines BIPs are potent antioxidants in DPPH ABTS and CUPRAC assay.
@highlight HAT governs antioxidant activity of OH substituted BIPs while SET PT dominates for other BIPs.
@highlight BIPs form a stable carbon centered radical cation in a solution.
@highlight Docking studies rationalized anticholinesterase and antimicrobial activity of BIPs.
