 Oral chemotherapy offers a more convenient treatment option for cancer patients but the effectiveness is significantly hindered by the limited drug delivery efficiency . Herein we designed legumain activable melittin decorated polymeric nanovehicles loading IR 780 and sorafenib to enhance their oral delivery to tumors with efficient accumulation and penetration capacity for combinational photothermal chemotherapy of gastric cancer . The nanosized LPN displayed good stability in simulated gastrointestinal fluids . After oral administration the oral bioavailability of sorafenib was remarkably improved 75.9 fold by LPN

@highlight Legumain activable melittin decorated polymeric nanovehicles LPN improve the oral delivery of water insoluble sorafenib.
@highlight Orally administered LPN preferentially accumulates at the tumor site with deep penetrating capacity.
@highlight Upon combination with laser irradiation LPN produced notable inhibition of tumor growth
@highlight counterpart nanovehicles.
@highlight LPN represents an encouraging oral delivery nanoplatform for oral combinational cancer therapy.
