 Radiation induced optic neuropathy is a serious complication that occurs after radiation therapy of tumors in the vicinity of the optic nerve yet its mechanism and imaging features are poorly understood . In this study we employed manganese enhanced MRI to assess optic nerve axonal transport in tree shrews and rats after irradiation . A comparison of normal visual projections in tree shrews and rats was conducted by intravitreal MnCl The eyeballs lens sizes vitreous volumes optic nerves and superior colliculi of tree shrews were significantly larger than those of rats on MEMRI . The Mn Tree shrews show great advantages in visual neuroscience research involving MEMRI . The main cause of the decline in axonal transport in RION is an insufficient level of motor protein rather than damage to the axonal cytoskeletal structure . Longitudinal MEMRI can be used to detect changes in axonal transport function and to observe the relatively intact axon structure from the early to late stages after radiation administration .
