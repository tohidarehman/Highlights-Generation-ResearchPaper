 Since several decades oximes have been used as part of treatment of nerve agent intoxication with the aim to restore the biological function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase after its covalent inhibition by organophosphorus compounds such as pesticides and nerve agents . Recent findings have illustrated that besides oximes certain Mannich phenols can reactivate the inhibited enzyme very effectively and may therefore represent an attractive complementary class of reactivators . In this paper we further probe the effect of structural variation on the in vitro efficacy of Mannich phenol based reactivators . Thus we present the synthesis of 14 compounds that are close variants of the previously reported 4 amino 2 phenol a very effective non oxime reactivator and 3 dimeric Mannich phenols . All compounds were assessed for their ability to reactivate human acetylcholinesterase inhibited by the nerve agents VX tabun sarin cyclosarin and paraoxon in vitro . It was confirmed that the potency of the compounds is highly sensitive to small structural changes leading to diminished reactivation potency in many cases . However the presence of 4 substituted alkylamine substituents was tolerated . More surprisingly the dimeric compounds demonstrated non typical behavior and displayed some reactivation potency as well . Both findings may open up new avenues for designing more effective non oxime reactivators .
