 Common use of classical antibiotics has caused to the growing emergence of many resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria . Therefore we aimed to synthesize a number of

@highlight We have described the synthesis of some novel
@highlight  2 hydroxy 4 or 5 nitrophenyl benzamides for their antimicrobial activities.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight  4 butyl 
@highlight  2 hydroxy 4 nitrophenyl benzamide 
@highlight  4 ethyl 
@highlight  2 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl benzamide and
@highlight  4 
@highlight  butyl 
@highlight  2 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl benzamide were found to be significantly active against
@highlight and MSSA with 4g ml MIC value even more potent than ceftazidime. 4 Butoxy 
@highlight  2 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl benzamide 
@highlight  displayed good activity against
@highlight Molecular docking studies revealed that
@highlight  and
@highlight showed good interactions with DNA gyrase PID 
@highlight  . Moreover 
@highlight has interacted with FtsA PID 
@highlight  enzyme in the binding mode as well.
@highlight The compounds
@highlight could be lead to discover new multidrug resistant antibacterial candidates.
