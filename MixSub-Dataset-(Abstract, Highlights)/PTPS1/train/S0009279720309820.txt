 Kinetic modeling of the behavior of complex chemical and biochemical systems is an effective approach to study of the mechanisms of the process . A kinetic model of coronaviral infection development with a description of the dynamic behavior of the main variables including the concentration of viral particles affected cells and pathogenic microflora is proposed . Changes in the concentration of hydrogen ions in the lungs and the pH dependence of carbonic anhydrase activity are critical . A significant result is the demonstration of an acute bifurcation transition that determines life or system collapse . This transition is connected with exponential growth of concentrations of the process participants and with functioning of the key enzyme carbonic anhydrase in development of toxic effects . Physical and chemical interpretations of the therapeutic effects of the body temperature rise and the potential therapeutic effect of thermoheliox are given . The phenomenon of thermovaccination is predicted which involves stimulation of the immune response by thermoheliox .
