 Drug delivery systems based on electrospun fibers have been under development for many years . However studies of controllable long term drug release from electrospun membrane systems and the underlying release mechanisms have seldom been reported . In this study electrospun membrane drug delivery systems consisting of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and FDA approved polymers are fabricated . Different second component polymers are introduced to change the properties of a poly It is found that the drug release profiles can be divided into three stages according to the rate of drug release . Stage I is controlled by fiber swelling and diffusion according to Fick s second law . Stage II is controlled by diffusion through a fused membrane structure which results in very slow drug release . Stage III is controlled by polymer degradation and involves release of the remaining drug . The results of this study of release mechanisms should provide a basis for adjustments of drug release dosage and duration thereby contributing to the development of drug delivery systems satisfying clinical requirements .

@highlight A long term drug release system can be obtained by simple blending electrospinning.
@highlight Blending different second component polymers can tailor the drug release profile.
@highlight Mechanisms of three stage drug release from electrospun fibers are revealed.
