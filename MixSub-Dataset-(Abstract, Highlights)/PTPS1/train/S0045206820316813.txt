 The quinolone 3 carboxylic acid scaffold is essential structure for antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin . Modification of 3 carboxylic functionality in this structure can be used for switching its activity from antibacterial to anticancer . Accordingly a series of C 3 modified ciprofloxacin derivatives containing

@highlight C 3 modified ciprofloxacin analogs bearing thiadiazole carboxamide were synthesized as anticancer agents.
@highlight MTT assay showed that most of them have significant activity against MCF 7 A549 and SKOV 3.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight were as potent as doxorubicin against MCF 7 cell line IC
@highlight s 3.263.90M .
@highlight Promising compounds
@highlight and
@highlight induced apoptosis and increased sub G1 cell population in MCF 7 cells.
@highlight Comet assay demonstrated the potential of compounds in DNA damage and fragmentation.
