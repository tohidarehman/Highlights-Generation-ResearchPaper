 8 17 and 17E DNAzyme are being explored as biosensors for metal ions and RNA motifs of interest more sensitive and efficient DNAzymes are required to meet the practical applications . Their similarity in the catalytic cores and differences in catalytic efficiency and metal ion dependence initiated great interest about the contribution of the catalytic residues . Functionalization of four adenine residues in the catalytic cores of 8 17 DNAzyme and 17E was conducted with amino guanidinium and imidazolyl groups . In the bulge loops of 8 17 and 17E N

@highlight New chemical modification approach found for more efficient 8 17DNAzyme and 17E DNAzymes.
@highlight More Ca
@highlight  specific DNAzymes obtained.
@highlight Importance of catalytic residues were evaluated at the level of functional groups.
