 In this work we describe the design synthesis and SAR studies of 2 benzylidenebenzofuran 3 ones a new family of potent inhibitors of CK2 . A series of aurones have been synthesized . These compounds are structurally related to the synthetic flavones and showed nanomolar activities towards CK2 . Biochemical tests revealed that 20 newly synthesized compounds inhibited CK2 with IC

@highlight New substituted benzylidenebenzofuran 3 2H ones were synthesized.
@highlight 41 aurones inhibited CK2 with IC
@highlight in nanomolar range of values.
@highlight The most promising compound
@highlight has an IC
@highlight  3.6nM with CLipE 4.94.
