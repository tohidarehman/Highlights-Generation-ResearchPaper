 Biodegradable microparticles as vaccine adjuvants have sparked the passion of researchers in recent decades . However it is still a huge challenge to develop an efficient vaccine delivery system to reverse chronic hepatitis B . Herein we integrated a physiochemical merit and an immunopotentiator property in poly MPs and verified the therapeutic effect on CHB model mice . We prepared uniform MPs with insertion of cationic lipid didodecyldimethylammonium bromide which endowed a physiochemical merit for MPs . Such a DDAB PLA group raised the recruitment of immune cells to the injection site along with the secretion of chemokines and pro inflammatory cytokines promoting the activation of antigen presenting cells . Further combination of stimulator of interferon genes agonist 5 6 dimethylxanthenone 4 acetic acid elevated 5.8 fold higher interferon regulatory factor 7 expression compared to that for DP group . The DP group showed preferred lysosome escape advantage which was in line with the DMXAA release behavior and the intracellular target of DMXAA . In addition DP D vaccine augmented the IFN

@highlight A uniform microparticle delivery system that integrated with cationic lipid DDAB and STING agonist DMXAA was fabricated.
@highlight The pump effect of DDAB facilitate DMXAA releasing into cytoplasm to interact with its ligand.
@highlight The microparticle based vaccines promoted the activation of antigen presenting cells and elicited immune responses at the injection site.
@highlight The microparticle based vaccines induced both humoral and cellular immune responses in healthy mice and achieved 50 HBsAg seroconversion rate on CHB model mice.
