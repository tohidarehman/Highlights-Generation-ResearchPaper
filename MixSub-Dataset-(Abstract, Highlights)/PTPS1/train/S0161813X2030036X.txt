 Modafinil is approved for narcolepsy and achieved high success in off label indications in memory related disorders . However chronic indiscriminate use of modafinil imposes several health hazards like hyperglycaemia obesity and metabolic syndrome owing to impairment of sleep wake cycle circadian rhythm and neurotransmission . The present protocol elucidates the effects of modafinil Modafinil was administered in rats from day 526 . To induce type 2 diabetes streptozotocin was given on day 1 and blood glucose assessed on day 5 . CPP was administered to antagonize sympathetic activity . After evaluation of cognitive functions serum lipid profile and biomarkers of oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase activity were assessed . Subacute dosing of modafinil significantly elevated blood glucose levels albeit considerably less than diabetic group and attenuated brain oxidative stress and AChE activity . Modafinil caused significant dyslipidaemia increased body weight whereas modestly altered abdominal circumference and thoracic circumference in rats . Significant hyperglycaemia derangement of serum lipid profile brain lipid peroxidation cholinergic hypofunction and decrease in body weight and AC Subacute dosing of modafinil differentially modulates long term and short term memory subtypes and also predisposes towards metabolic derangements .

@highlight Modafinil overuse may pose adverse metabolic repercussions.
@highlight Modafinil initiated hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia in rats.
@highlight It attenuated oxidative stress and cholinergic hypoactivity in the brain of rats.
@highlight Modafinil enhanced short term memory but has no effect on long term memory.
@highlight Sympathetic overstimulation is implicated in influence of modafinil in rats.
