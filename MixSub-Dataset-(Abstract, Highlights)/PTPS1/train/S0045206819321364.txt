 In cardiac ischemic disorder pyroglutamate helix B surface peptide which derived from erythropoietin causes to increase cell stability . To improve the serum stability of pHBSP two lipophilic amino acids Arg

@highlight The use of PEG dendrimer G
@highlight as a chelator caused the production of labelled nanoconjugate with high purity and stability.
@highlight The
@highlight Tc nanocojugated showed a statically significant tendency to bind to EPO BcR receptor on hypoxic cell surface.
@highlight The biodistribution studies of prepared
@highlight Tc nanoconjugate were indicative of higher uptake in the cardiac ischemic region.
