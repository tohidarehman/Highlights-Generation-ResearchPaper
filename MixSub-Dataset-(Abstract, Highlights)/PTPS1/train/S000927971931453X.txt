 Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract has been reported to exhibit a variety of protective effects such as antioxidant anti atherosclerosis and other pharmacological effects . As a member of the complement system complement component 3 deposition in the glomerulus is recognized as an important causative mediator of various kidney diseases . In this study we aimed to identify the effect of GSPE on C3 in the chronic kidney fibrosis and evaluate the possible mechanism . We observed that administration of GSPE relieves inflammation and chronic renal fibrosis in mouse models of UUO . GSPE inhibited C3 secreted by macrophages to relieve renal interstitial inflammation . In vitro we found that C3 stimulated HMGB1 translocation form nucleus to cytoplasm and promote the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines including TGF 1 in primary renal tubular epithelial cells which could be inhibited by GSPE . Meanwhile GSPE could also decreased HMGB1 induced EMT of PTEC through suppresses the HMGB1 TLR4 p65 TGF 1 pathway . In addition the myofibroblast activation was inhibited by GSPE via TGF 1 Smad2 3 signaling pathways in normal rat kidney fibroblast cells . Overall these observations provide that GSPE alleviates renal fibrosis by inhibiting the C3 HMGB1 TGF 1 pathway and could thus lead to find the potential therapy for the suppression of renal fibrosis .

@highlight GSPE mitigates the release of C3 to renal interstitium by macrophages in UUO.
@highlight Secretion of C3 appears to promote HMGB1 translocation that is inhibited by GSPE.
@highlight GSPE suppressed HMGB1 TLR4 p65 pathway thereby inhibiting production of TGF 1.
