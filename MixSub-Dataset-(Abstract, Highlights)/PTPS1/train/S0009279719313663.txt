 Bone mesenchymal stem cells are a well known donor graft source due to their potential for self renewal and differentiation into multi lineage cell types including osteoblasts that are critical for fracture healing . Fasudil a Rho kinase inhibitor has been proven to induce the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into neuron like cells . However its role in the osteogenesis of BMSCs remain uncertain . Herein we for the first time studied the effects of FAS on osteogenic differentiation in a mouse fracture model and further explored the involved mechanisms in mouse BMSCs . The results showed that FAS stimulated bone formation in the fracture mouse model . Additionally at 30M FAS significantly promotes alkaline phosphatase activity mineralization and the expression of osteogenic markers COL 1 RUNX2 and OCN in murine BMSCs . Blocking of P38 by SB202190 significantly reversed the effects of FAS in vitro suggesting that P38 but not ERK or JNK activation is required for FAS induced osteogenesis . Collectively our results indicate that FAS may be a promising agent for promoting fracture healing .

@highlight We firstly found that Fasudil can induce the osteogenesis of BMSCs.
@highlight Fasudil enhances the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through the MAPK P38 signaling pathway.
@highlight Fasudil may be a promising agent for promoting fracture healing in addition to its function on cerebral vasospasms.
