 Trigonelline is a plant alkaloid that has generated interest for its neuroprotective roles in brain pathology . However the protective effect of trigonelline on cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury and the potential mechanism have not been fully evaluated . Our results showed that trigonelline pretreatment ameliorated oxygen glucose deprivation reperfusion induced hippocampal neurons injury . The OGD R caused reactive oxygen species generation and decreased concentrations of superoxide dismutases and glutathione peroxidase were markedly attenuated by trigonelline . In addition the increased levels of TNF IL 6 and IL 1 in OGD R induced hippocampal neurons were significantly decreased by trigonelline pretreatment . Trigonelline also suppressed caspase 3 activity and bax expression and induced bcl 2 expression in OGD R induced hippocampal neurons . Furthermore trigonelline induced the activation of PI3K Akt pathway in hippocampal neurons exposed to OGD R condition . Inhibition of PI3K Akt signaling reversed the protective effects of trigonelline on OGD R induced hippocampal neurons injury . Taken together these findings indicated that trigonelline protected hippocampal neurons from OGD R induced injury which was mediated by the activation of PI3K Akt signaling pathway .
