 The debilitating nature of cognitive impairment in epilepsy and the potential of some traditional antiepileptics to further deteriorate cognitive function are areas of growing concern . Glucagon like peptide 1 deficiency has been linked to reduced seizure threshold as well as cognitive dysfunction . Here we tested whether sitagliptin by virtue of its neuroprotective properties could alleviate both epilepsy and associated cognitive dysfunction in a rat model of kindling epilepsy . Chemical kindling was induced by subconvulsive doses of pentylenetetrazol . SITA was administered 1h before PTZ injections . SITA conceivably attenuated PTZ hippocampal histological insult preserved neuronal integrity and amended neurotransmitter perturbations in rat hippocampi paralleled with enhanced hippocampal GLP 1 levels as well as the downstream cAMP content and protein kinase A activity . Moreover SITA improved cognitive functioning of rats in the Morris water maze which was coupled with hampered hippocampal p Ser

@highlight PTZ kindling is associated with diminished hippocampal GLP 1.
@highlight SITA protected against PTZ induced seizures and cognitive deficits in rats.
@highlight SITA improves cognitive function in kindled rats evidenced by lowered A and p tau as well as increased Ach levels.
@highlight SITA corrects glutamate GABA imbalance in kindled rats possibly via GSK 3 MMP9 BDNF modulation.
@highlight SITA attenuated hippocampal RAGE and BACE1levels in kindled rats.
