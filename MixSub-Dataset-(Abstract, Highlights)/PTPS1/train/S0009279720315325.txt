 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic neglected tropical disease and result in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from a single ulceration to a progressive and fatal visceral disease . Comprising a limited and highly toxic therapeutic arsenal new treatments are urgently needed . Targeting delivery of drugs has been a promising approach for visceral leishmaniasis . Phosphatidylserine liposomes have demonstrated superior efficacy in VL targeting intracellular parasites in host cells through macrophage scavenger receptors . In this work we investigated the
