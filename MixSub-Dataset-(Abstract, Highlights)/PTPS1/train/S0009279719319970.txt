 Pyroptosis a form of programmed cell death has garnered increasing attention as it relates to innate immunity and diseases . The discovery of caspase 1 3 4 5 8 11 function in sensing various challenges expands the spectrum of pyroptosis mediators and also reveals that pyroptosis is not cell type specific . Recent studies have identified that pyroptosis has become a new topic in cancer research because it may affect all stages of carcinogenesis . In this mini review we provided a primer on pyroptosis discussed the induction of pyroptosis in cancer and its implications in cancer management . Moreover its two important executioners the gasdermin D and gasdermin E the functions and mechanisms of them involved in the regulation of cancer therapy were focused on . Small molecules mediated pyroptosis were found to effectively inhibit various tumor cells . In brief the findings of pyroptosis dependent cancer progression new drugs and therapeutic targets may lead to a promising novel therapeutic approach for cancer patients .

@highlight Pyroptosis is a pro inflammatory form of programmed cell death.
@highlight Pyroptosis can be mainly induced via the activation of caspase 3 4 5 8 11.
@highlight Pyroptosis plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of cancer diseases.
@highlight Pyroptosis pathway is a potential therapeutic target in cancer diseases.
