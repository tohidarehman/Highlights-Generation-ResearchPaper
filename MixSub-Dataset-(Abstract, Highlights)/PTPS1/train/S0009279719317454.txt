 Cisplatin and other platinum based antineoplastic drugs are highly effective and widely used in the treatment of solid tumors in both pediatric and adult patients . Although considered to be life saving as a cancer treatment Pt based drugs frequently result in dose limiting toxicities such as chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathies . Specifically irreversible damage to outer hair cells and injury of sensory neurons are linked to profound sensorineural hearing loss which complicates tumor management and can lead to a poor clinical prognosis . Given the severity of CIPN substantial effort has been devoted to the development of neuroprotective compounds regardless clinical results have been underwhelming . It is noteworthy that Pt is a highly reactive electrophile that causes toxicity by forming adducts with nucleophilic targets on macromolecules . In this regard we have discovered a series of carbon based enol nucleophiles e.g . N 2 oxocytclopentane 1 carboxamide that can prevent neurotoxicity by scavenging the platinum ion . The chemistry of enol compounds is well understood and mechanistic research has demonstrated the role of this chemistry in cytoprotection . Our cell derived data were corroborated by calculations of hard and soft acids and bases parameters that describe the electronic character of interacting electrophiles and nucleophiles . Together these observations indicate that the respective mechanisms of Pt neurotoxicity and antitumor activity are separable and can therefore be affected independently .

@highlight Enolate forming compounds provide protection against platinum induced ototoxicity.
@highlight CisPt associated neurotoxicity and antitumor activity mechanisms are independent.
