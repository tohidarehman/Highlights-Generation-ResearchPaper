 The bioactive peptides and trace element selenium both have good antioxidant activity . However whether combined Se and bioactive peptides have more excellent antioxidant activity remain unknown . The aim of this study is to prepare a Se rich peptide fraction containing both Se and peptides from Se rich yeast protein hydrolysate and investigated its antioxidant activity and effect on ultraviolet B radiation induced skin oxidative damage . The peptide fractions with different molecular weight and Se content were obtained by enzymatically hydrolyzing normal or Se rich yeast proteins followed by a filtration process .

@highlight The synergistic effect of Se and yeast peptide was studied for the first time.
@highlight Se rich peptide had the stronger free radical scavenging activity
@highlight Se rich peptide fraction could effectively improve the antioxidant capacity
@highlight Se rich peptide significantly attenuated UVB induced skin oxidative damage in mice.
