 The clinical efficacy of existing cancer therapies is still far from satisfactory . There is an urgent need to integrate the emerging biomedical discovery and technological innovation with traditional therapies . Ferroptosis a non apoptotic programmed cell death modality has attracted remarkable attention as an emerging therapeutic target for cancer treatment especially with the burgeoning bionanotechnology . Given the rapid progression in ferroptosis driven cancer nanotherapeutics we intend to outline the latest advances in this field at the intersection of ferroptosis and bionanotechnology . First the research background of ferroptosis and nanotherapeutics is briefly introduced to illustrate the feasibility of ferroptosis driven nanotherapeutics for cancer therapy . Second the emerging nanotherapeutics developed to facilitate ferroptosis of tumor cells are overviewed including promotion of the Fenton reaction inhibition of cellular glutathione peroxidase 4 and exogenous regulation of lipid peroxidation . Moreover ferroptosis based combination therapeutics are discussed including the emerging nanotherapeutics combining ferroptosis with tumor imaging phototherapy chemotherapy and immunomodulation . Finally the future expectations and challenges of ferroptosis driven nanotherapeutics in clinical cancer therapy are spotlighted .
