 The relationship between the particle size and lung retention time of inhaled nanocarriers was unclear and this uncertainty hampered the design of nanocarriers for pulmonary delivery . The debate resulted from a lack of knowledge regarding the integrity of the involved nanocarriers . A distinguishable bioimaging probe which could differentiate between integrated and disintegrated nanocarriers by emitting different signals was introduced to address this problem . The aza BODIPY structured aggregation caused quenching probes were promising candidates because they showed intense fluorescence signals in intact nanocarriers while quenched after the decomposition of nanocarriers . This attribute was called an on off switch . In this paper ACQ probes were encapsulated into a solid lipid nanoparticle suspension with different particle sizes and the relationship between particle size and lung retention time after pulmonary delivery was investigated in BALB c mice . The results showed that a larger particle size led to a longer lung retention time . By comparing with the results of a non water quenching probe the SLNS systems were found to be mostly intact in the pulmonary region . These findings will serve as a firm basis for the design and development of nanocarriers for pulmonary delivery .
