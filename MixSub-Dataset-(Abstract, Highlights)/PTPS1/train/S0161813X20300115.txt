 The neurotransmitter dopamine is a neuromodulator in the positive and negative regulation of brain circuits . Dopamine insufficiency or overload has been implicated in aberrant activities of neural circuits that play key roles in the pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric diseases . Dopaminergic neurons are vulnerable to environmental insults . The neurotoxin methylmercury produces dopaminergic neuron damage in rodent as well as in

@highlight Chronic exposure to MeHg selectively induces puncta formation in CEP dopaminergic neurons.
@highlight The puncta are likely composed of homologous mCherry molecules packaged at the dendritic site for exportation.
@highlight The expression levels of gst 4 and tubulin genes are not significantly modified under chronic MeHg exposure paradigm.
