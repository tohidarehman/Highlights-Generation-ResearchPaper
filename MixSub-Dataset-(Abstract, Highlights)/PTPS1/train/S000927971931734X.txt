 Epidemiological studies have shown that cigarette smoking is beneficial in ulcerative colitis and that nicotine may be responsible for this effect . However the mechanism remains unclear . In a previous study nicotine was found to induce autophagy in intestinal cells . Here we evaluated the effect of nicotine induced autophagy in a dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis mouse model . C57BL 6 adult male mice drank DSS water solution freely for seven consecutive days and then tap water was administered . The effect of nicotine treatment was examined in the DSS model including colon length disease severity histology of the colon tissue and inflammation levels . Moreover autophagy levels were detected by Western blot analysis . The levels of DSS induced colitis were significantly decreased following nicotine treatment . The disease activity score body weight histologic damage scores and the level of colonic inflammatory factors of nicotine treated mice all decreased compared to those of the control mice . Additionally nicotine enhanced the expression of LC3II LC3I and beclin 1 but decreased the p62 protein level . Inhibiting autophagy by 3 MA attenuated the protective effects of nicotine on colitis . Additionally both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed changes in AMPK mTOR P70S6K during this process . These results suggest that nicotine improved colitis by regulating autophagy and provided a protective effect against DSS induced colitis .

@highlight Cigarette smoking is beneficial in ulcerative colitis and nicotine may be responsible for this effect.
@highlight Nicotine ameliorated DSS induced colitis and enhanced the autophagy.
@highlight Blockade of autophagy attenuates the protective effect of nicotine.
@highlight Nicotine enhanced autophagy was regulated by the AMPK mTOR pathway.
