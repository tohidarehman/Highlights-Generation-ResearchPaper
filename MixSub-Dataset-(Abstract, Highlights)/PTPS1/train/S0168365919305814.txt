 With the in depth research of organelles the microenvironment characteristics of their own such as the acid environment of lysosomes and the high temperature environment of mitochondria could be used as a natural and powerful condition for tumor therapy . Based on this we constructed a two step precise targeting nanoplatform which can realize the drug release and drug action triggered by the microenvironment of lysosomes and mitochondria respectively . To begin with the mesoporous silica nanoparticles were modified with triphenylphosphonium and loaded with 2 2 azobis propane dihydrochloride . Then folic acid targeted pH sensitive liposomes containing docetaxel were prepared by thin film dispersion method and the core shell AIPH

@highlight This two step precise targeting nanoplatform could realize the site specific release of different drugs.
@highlight Apoptosis was caused by utilizing the organelles own characteristics.
@highlight Two drugs with different mechanisms achieve the purpose of synergistic anti tumor.
