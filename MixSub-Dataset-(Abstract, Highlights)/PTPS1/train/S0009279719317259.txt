 Heroin is a highly addictive opioid drug synthesized from morphine . The use of heroin and incidence of heroin associated overdose death has increased sharply in the US . Heroin is primarily metabolized via deacetylation forming the active metabolites 6 monoacetylmorphine and morphine . A diminution in heroin hydrolysis is likely to cause higher drug effects and toxicities . In this study we sought to determine the contribution of the major hepatic hydrolase carboxylesterase 1 to heroin metabolism in the liver as well as the potential influence of one of its known genetic variants G143E . Furthermore given the potential therapeutic application of cannabidiol for heroin addiction and the frequent co abuse of cannabis and heroin we also assessed the effects of CBD on heroin metabolism .

@highlight Hepatic carboxylesterase 1 contributes to 3.66 of heroin hydrolysis in the liver.
@highlight Carboxylesterase 1 G143E variant unlikely to clinically impact heroin metabolism.
@highlight Cannabidiol is a potent in vitro inhibitor of the two step hydrolysis of heroin.
@highlight Cannabidiol can potentially interact with heroin in various clinical settings.
