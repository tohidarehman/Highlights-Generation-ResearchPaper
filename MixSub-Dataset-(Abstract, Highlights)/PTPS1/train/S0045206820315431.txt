 Quinoxaline is one of the privileged heterocyclic fragments for drug molecules . Quinoxaline anticancer drug candidates XK469 and CQS exhibit antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties against various cancers . Based on their chemical structures we therefore synthesized a series of quinoxaline 1 3 4 oxadiazole hybrids and assessed their anticancer potential on human leukemia HL 60 cells . Although these hybrids exerted significant inhibition of HL 60 cell proliferation they showed high cytotoxicity on human normal cells . Utilizing information from molecular modelling of the hybrids to the anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein we added substructures including phenyl piperazine piperidine and morpholine rings to their frameworks . The designed quinoxaline 1 3 4 oxadiazole hybrid derivatives successfully induced apoptotic response on HL 60 cells with low toxicity on WI 38 cells . Furthermore RT PCR analysis demonstrated that these derivatives predominantly inhibit Bcl 2 expression . Our findings highlight the great potential for the development of synthetic quinoxaline 1 3 4 oxadiazole hybrid derivatives as proapoptotic anticancer agents .

@highlight Quinoxaline 1 3 4 oxadiazole hybrid derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight The hybrids induced apoptosis on leukemic cells without cytotoxicity on normal cells.
