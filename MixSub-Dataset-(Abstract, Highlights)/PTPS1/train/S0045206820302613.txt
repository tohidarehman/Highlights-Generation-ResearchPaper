 Two key enzymes like glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 play an important role in the development of Type 2 diabetes and inhibiting them is a common treatment strategy for T2D . In this study an ultrafiltration centrifugation approach was developed to isolate peptides from dark protein extract . Consequently 6 peptides TAELLPR CGKKFVR AVPANLVDLNVPALLK VVDLVFFAAAK MSLYPR and QGQELLPSDFK were identified . The four peptides exhibited glucosidase inhibition activities with the IC
