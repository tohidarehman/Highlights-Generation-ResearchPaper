 Chemotherapy is an important modality available for cancer treatment . However the present chemotherapy is still far from being satisfactory mainly owing to the severe side effects of the chemotherapeutic agents and drug resistance of cancer cells . Thus reversing drug resistance by constructing an ideal chemotherapeutic strategy with the least side effects and the best efficacy is greatly needed . Here we designed a smart nanosystem of thermo sensitive liposome coated gold nanocages with doxorubicin loading for near infrared triggered drug release and chemo photothermal combination therapy . The biocompatible liposomes coating facilitated the cellular uptake of LAD and meanwhile avoided drug leakage during the circulation . More importantly LAD exhibited controllable photothermal conversion property and produced mild heat under NIR irradiation which not only triggered DOX release and transferred DOX from lysosome to nucleus but also elicited the mild heat cell killing effect to improve the curative efficiency . Further mechanism study revealed that mild heat could reverse drug resistance by down regulation of the chemoresistance related markers

@highlight Thermo sensitive liposome coated gold nanocages with doxorubicin loading LAD was constructed.
@highlight NIR triggered doxorubicin release from LAD and elicited mild heat cell killing effect to improve the curative efficiency.
@highlight Mild heat increased drug uptake by down regulation of the chemoresistance related markers and sensitiveness related genes.
