 Pulpal infection is one of the most common causes of dental emergency admission . Tooth pain due to infection caused by gram negative bacteria is the main manifestation of this sort of dental problem . The GPR173 signaling pathway is a highly conserved G protein coupled receptor that mediates neurological and reproductive function . In this study we found that GPR173 was fairly expressed in isolated human dental pulp cells and its expression was reduced in response to pro inflammatory lipopolysaccharide treatment . The activation of GPR173 by its ligand Phoenixin 20 reduced LPS induced cytotoxicity as revealed by a reduction in the release of LDH . Additionally Phoenixin 20 suppressed LPS induced release of pro inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators including IL 6 MCP 1 VCAM 1 and ICAM 1 as well as MMP 2 and MMP 9 . Mechanistically we showed the suppressive action of Phoenixin 20 on LPS induced activation of TLR 4 and Myd88 as well as the activation of the NF B pathway . Collectively our study demonstrates that the GPR173 signaling pathway is an important mediator of LPS induced inflammation and the activation of GPR173 by its natural ligand Phoenixin 20 exhibits robust anti inflammatory effects in dental pulp cells suggesting that GPR173 is an interesting target molecule in the development of pulp cell based therapies .
