 Diminution of oxidative stress mediated diseases is an essential pharmaceutical objective in modern biomedical research . The present work stresses upon the efficient and eco friendly synthesis of an array of novel diversely functionalized pyrrole derivatives which are found to be antioxidants with reactive oxygen species shielding competency against the deleterious consequence of oxidative stress . The results of the investigation displayed the effect of structural modification of the pyrrole derivatives on their respective antioxidant properties to various ROS . Noteworthy the pyrrole moiety bearing 4 hydroxycoumarin or 2 hydroxy 1 4 naphthoquinone as substituent showed outstanding defensive potency towards
