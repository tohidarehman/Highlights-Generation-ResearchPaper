 Oxidative stress provides a major contribution to the pathogenesis of glaucoma and may induce retinal ganglion cell damage . Transforming growth factor has appeared as a neuroprotective protein in various indignities . However the TGF mechanism of protective effects against oxidative stress damage in RGCs still undetermined . In our research we investigated the regulatory mechanisms and potential effects of TGF 1 TGF 2 in hydrogen peroxide H

@highlight TGF 1 protected RGCs from H2O2 induced oxidative stress.
@highlight ALDH3A1 upregulation may defend RGCs against oxidative injury.
@highlight TGF 1 enhanced the activation of Nrf2 HO 1 HIF 1 signal transduction.
@highlight Pathway characterization of hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress on RGCs.
