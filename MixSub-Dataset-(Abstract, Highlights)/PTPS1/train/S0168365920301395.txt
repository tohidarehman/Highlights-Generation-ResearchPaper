 Liver fibrosis leads to over one million deaths annually worldwide . Hepatic stellate cells have been identified as the main executors of liver fibrosis . Unfortunately no drug has yet been approved for clinical use against liver fibrosis largely because the tested drugs have been unable to access HSCs and efficiently remove the collagen accumulation involved in fibrogenesis . Here we designed an efficient HSC targeting lipid delivery system that carried dual siRNAs intended to both inhibit collagen synthesis and promote collagen degradation with the goal of realizing enhanced anti liver fibrosis by bidirectional regulation of collagen accumulation . The delivery system was constructed by using amphiphilic cationic hyperbranched lipoids C
