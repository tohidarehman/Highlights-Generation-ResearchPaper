 The organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos is suspected to cause developmental neurotoxicity in children leading to long term effects . Developmental exposure of rat pups to CPF at low levels disrupts degradation of the brain endocannabinoids through the inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase and decreases the reactivity of juvenile rats in an emergence test . In this study we further investigated the effects of developmental CPF exposure on behavior but also included exposure to PF 04457845 a specific inhibitor of FAAH for comparison of behavior altered by FAAH inhibition with behavior altered by CPF . Ten day old rat pups were exposed orally either to 0.5 0.75 or 1.0mg kg CPF or 0.02mg kg PF 04457845 daily for 7 days . In an open field the high CPF and PF 04457845 groups exhibited increased motor activity but no differences in the time spent in the fields center . In an elevated plus maze all treatment groups had increased open arm activity but ethological behaviors associated with anxiety were not altered . Behaviors in the maze associated with increased general activity and exploratory drive were increased . Social interactions were measured and all treatment groups exhibited increased levels of play behavior . The similarities in behavior between PF 04457845 and CPF suggest that enhanced endocannabinoid signaling during the exposure period plays a role in the persistent alteration of behavior observed following developmental CPF exposure .

@highlight Chlorpyrifos CPF is an organophosphorus insecticide and suspected developmental neurotoxicant.
@highlight Repeated exposure of juvenile rats to CPF increased adolescent exploratory behavior and social play behaviors.
@highlight Repeated exposure of juvenile rats to a specific FAAH inhibitor also increased adolescent exploratory and social play behaviors.
@highlight Developmental brain FAAH inhibition is one mechanism responsible for the persistent effects of developmental CPF exposure.
