 Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles were widely used for ablation of cancer cells because of their potential on physical treatment . Herein we developed the cell targeting destructive multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles based on PEI PLGA co loaded with the anticancer drug Olaparib and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles Fe

@highlight A multifunctional nanosystem with the capabilities of cancer cell targeting magnetic remote control and MRI was developed.
@highlight This nanosystem displayed pronounced therapeutic efficiency on triple negative breast cancer.
@highlight HA Olb PPMNPs with RMF could cause two strikes effect including magneto cell lysis and magneto cell apoptosis.
