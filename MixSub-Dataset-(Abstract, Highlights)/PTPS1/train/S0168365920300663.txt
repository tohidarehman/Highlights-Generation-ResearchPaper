 Macrophages an important component of the innate immune response are a key regulator of intestinal microenvironment homeostasis . These cells essentially contribute to chronic inflammatory diseases due to their strong plasticity . As is known ulcerative colitis a chronic inflammatory disease is closely related to immune dysfunction . A growing body of evidence suggests that the macrophage is a promising drug target for modulating the intestinal immune systems and regulating the inflammatory microenvironment thus alleviating the inflammatory responses in UC . The macrophage based therapy strategies for UC are still at an emerging stage . The advanced drug delivery systems can improve the macrophage based therapy . This article will review the molecular mechanisms related to macrophage polarization and the interactions between signaling pathways that regulate the pathogenesis of UC and summarize the macrophage based nanotherapeutic strategies in UC .
