 Aldose reductase catalyzes the NADPH dependent reduction of glucose to sorbitol in the polyol pathway which plays an important role in the development of diabetic complications including cataract retinopathy nephropathy and neuropathy . AR has been considered as an important target to heal these long term diabetic complications and for this reason the development of new AR inhibitors is an important approach in modern medicinal chemistry . In the current study new 4 aryl 2 2 3 4 dihydro 2
