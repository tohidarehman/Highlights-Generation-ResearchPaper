 Histone deacetylases are involved in chromatin remodelling and thus play a vital role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression . HDAC inhibitors alter the acetylation status of histone and non histone proteins to regulate various cellular events such as transcription . Novel HDAC inhibitors were designed and synthesised to promote higher levels of recombinant protein production in tobacco cell cultures . The effect of these chemical enhancers on the epigenetic profiles in plant cells has been evaluated by molecular docking

@highlight Twenty five SAHA analogues were designed synthesised and evaluated as plant histone deacetylase inhibitors.
@highlight Molecular Docking showed interactions between the compounds and the active site of HDAC.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight  with a fluorine atom at the ortho position in the aromatic ring led to an increase in histone H3 acetylation levels.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight promoted an increase in the accumulation levels of recombinant protein in the plant cell culture.
