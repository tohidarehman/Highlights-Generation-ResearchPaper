 The 2 aminothiazole functionality has long been established as a privileged structural feature and therefore frequently exploited in the process of drug discovery and development . It has been introduced into numerous compounds due to its capacity for targeting a wide range of therapeutic target proteins . On the other hand the aminothiazole group has also been classified as a toxicophore susceptible to metabolic activation and the ensuing reactive metabolite formation hence caution is warranted when used in drug design . This review is divided into three parts entailing

@highlight The advantages of the 2 aminothiazole group in medicinal chemistry were detailed.
@highlight 2 aminothiazoles were studied as toxicophores that form reactive metabolites.
@highlight Chemical strategies that reduce the intrinsic hepatotoxicity were highlighted.
