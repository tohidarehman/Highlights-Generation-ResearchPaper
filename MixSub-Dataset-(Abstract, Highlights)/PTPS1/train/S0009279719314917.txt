 Pulmonary hypertension is distal pulmonary arterial remodelling and is mainly due to the abnormal proliferation and apoptosis resistance of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells . Apigenin a natural dietary flavonoid is a promising PH preventive agent that inhibits PASMC proliferation and induces apoptosis . In this study we investigated the biological effects of apigenin on PH . PH was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by chronic hypoxia exposure . Administration of apigenin prevented the development of PH hypoxia induced right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arterial remodelling and prevented the progression of established PH in this model . Moreover treatment with apigenin induced mitochondria dependent apoptosis . To explore the underlying mechanisms the mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondria dependent apoptosis factors cytochrome C BAX Bcl 2 cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 were analysed . These results confirmed that apigenin induces mitochondria dependent apoptosis in hypoxic PASMCs to protect against PH . In addition treatment with apigenin reversed hypoxia induced inhibition of KV1.5 expression both
