 Testicular damage contributes to cyclosporine A induced male infertility . However the exact underlying molecular mediators involved in CsA induced testis disorder remains unclear . The present study aimed to characterize the role of mir 34a sirt 1 in CsA induced testicular injury alone or in combination with curcumin . A total of twenty eight male Wistar rats were subdivided into four groups control sham cyclosporine A cyclosporineA curcumin . The animals received cyclosporine A and curcumin for 28 days by oral gavage . At the end of the experiment CsA administration signicantly resulted in a decrease in testis weight and testis coefficient . The molecular analysis demonstrated that CsA exposure increased 8 OHdg and Nox4 protein contents in the testis tissue . TUNEL staining indicated that CsA caused the number of apoptotic cells to increase in the testes of male rats . In addition exposure to CsA resulted in an increased expression of Bax and a decreased expresion in that of Bcl 2 with a concomitant up regulation of the Bax Bcl 2 c Caspase 3 p Caspase 3 ratio and cytochrome
