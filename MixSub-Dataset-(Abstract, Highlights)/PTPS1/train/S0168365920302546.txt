 Triple negative breast cancer does not respond to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy as a result of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment . To remodel the tumor microenvironment we developed a liposome formulation to deliver a potential immunogenic cell death inducing agent 17 17 demethoxygeldanamycin in a tumor targeted manner to reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitate the checkpoint blockade immunotherapy . The 17 AAG liposomes was prepared by thin film dispersion methods . The orthotopic 4T1 murine triple negative breast cancer model was studied . 17 AAG delivered by liposome remodeled the immunosuppressive microenvironment significantly increased tumor infiltrating T cells lowered the hypoxia level decreased the suppressive lymphocytes such as tumor associated macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment . In addition real time PCR analysis revealed that chemokines and cytokines with immunosuppressive properties were notably reduced which further facilitated the T cell mediated immunotherapy . Despite the fact that low dose 17 AAG liposomes demonstrated a limited therapeutic effect alone on 4T1 tumor promising efficacy was observed when 17 AAG liposomes combined with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy . Taken together 17 AAG liposomes could remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment of triple negative breast cancer and facilitate the checkpoint blockade immunotherapy .

@highlight In murine model of stage IV triple negative breast cancer 17 allylamino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin 17 AAG could increase the immunogenicity of tumor as a Hsp90 inhibitor.
@highlight 17 AAG is a promising candidate to empower immunogenic cell death both
@highlight and
@highlight The combination of 17 AAG liposomes and checkpoint blockade provides a novel strategy to increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy in triple negative breast cancer.
