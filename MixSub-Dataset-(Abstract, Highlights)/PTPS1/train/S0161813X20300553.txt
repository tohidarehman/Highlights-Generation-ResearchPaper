 Fenobucarb is an extensively used carbamate insecticide . Its developmental neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms have not been well investigated . In this study zebrafish embryos were exposed to various concentrations of BPMC from 6 hpf to 120 hpf . BPMC induced developmental toxicity with reduced motility in larval zebrafish . The spinal cord neutrophil infiltration increased ROS production caspase 3 and 9 activation central nerve and peripheral motor neuron damage axon and myelin degeneration were observed in zebrafish treated with BPMC generally in a dose dependent manner . The expression of eight marker genes for nervous system function or development namely

@highlight Fenobucarb BPMC induced developmental neurotoxicity in zebrafish characterized by motility reduction motor neuron damage axon and myelin degeneration.
@highlight Spinal cord neutrophil infiltration ROS production increasion caspases 3 and 9 activation were observed in zebrafish treated with BPMC in a dose dependent manner.
@highlight The expression of eight marker genes for nervous system function or development were significantly downregulated following BPMC exposure.
@highlight These results indicate that BPMC induces developmental neurotoxicity through pathways involved in inflammation oxidative apoptosis and degeneration.
