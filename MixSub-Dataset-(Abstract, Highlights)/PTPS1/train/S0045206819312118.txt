 A concise total synthesis of an exceedingly potent anti inflammatory agent violacin A as well as the preparation of thirty analogues of this lead from commercially available orcinol are described . Highlights of our synthetic efforts involve Friedel Crafts acylation the regioselective etherification and esterification of phenolic hydroxyl groups and Baker Venkatamaran rearrangement to form basic skeleton of violacin A . The deprotection reaction with Pd catalytic was involved to avoid the elimination of the hemiacetal hydroxyl at C2 . In addition all synthetic compounds were screened for anti inflammatory activity against nitric oxide production using lipopolysaccharide induced Raw264.7 cells . A range of violacin A derivatives

@highlight Violacin A with potent anti inflammatory activity was firstly synthesized.
@highlight Thirty analogues were obtained by similar synthetic procedure with violacin A.
@highlight Ten analogues exhibit stronger anti inflammatory activities than violacin A.
@highlight Analogue
@highlight inhibited NF B signaling pathway in LPS induced Raw264.7 cells.
