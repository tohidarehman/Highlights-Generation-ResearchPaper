 Ferroptosis is recently identified form of regulated cell death which differs from previously identified cell death in a way that it is driven by iron dependent lipid peroxide accumulation . Morphologically cell volume shrinkage and increased mitochondrial membrane density are main features which characterize this form of cell death . Molecular mechanism of ferroptosis induction involved suppression of the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase 4 and further intracellular accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species a process in which iron is involved either via inhibition of system Xc or direct inhibition of GPX4 . Several other pathways like RAS MAPK and NRF2 are found to be involved in ferroptosis regulation . However the precise mechanism of ferroptosis induction is not revealed till date . Like other regulated cell deaths ferroptosis plays important role in tumor suppression and progression as revealed by several scientific reports . This review summarizes basic information about discovery of this novel cell death mechanism including molecular mechanism of its induction and further explains the roles of ferroptosis in human cancers .
