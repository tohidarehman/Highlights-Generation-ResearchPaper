 CXCR4 chemokine receptor represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its key role in cancer metastasis and inflammatory diseases . Starting from our previously developed pharmacophoric model we applied a combined computational and experimental approach that led to the identification of the hydantoin alkaloids parazoanthines isolated from the Mediterranean Sea anemone

@highlight Natural and synthetic parazoanthines were identified as CXCR4 antagonists.
@highlight Parazoanthine B was the most potent compound with an IC
@highlight of 9.3nM.
@highlight An optimized pharmacophoric model was obtained from parazoanthine scaffold.
