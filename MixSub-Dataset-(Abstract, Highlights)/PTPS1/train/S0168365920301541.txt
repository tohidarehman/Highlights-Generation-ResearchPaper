 Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly exploited as vehicles for the targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs . In antibody drug conjugates antibodies specifically deliver cytotoxic compounds to cancer cells . Here we present a technology for elevating the intracellular delivery of antibodies by the conjugation of tetrameric cell penetrating peptides . The solid phase synthesis of tCPPs and their application in a chemical modification strategy for mAbs provides constructs that attain up to fourfold elevated internalization rates while retaining the mAbs target specificity . The antigen independent internalization is accompanied by beneficial pharmacokinetics limiting off target accumulation . Applicability was proven for matuzumab trastuzumab and the ADC Kadcyla . Cytotoxicity studies of tCPP conjugates of Kadcyla resulted in a sixfold increased cytotoxicity proving the potential of chemical modification strategies to extend the applicability of biologicals . This constitutes a significant step towards next generation antibody based therapeutics .

@highlight Conjugation of multimeric cell penetrating peptides strongly increases the internalization of mAbs and ADCs.
@highlight Antibody specificity is retained despite the conjugation of the multimeric cell penetrating peptides.
@highlight Antibody modification leads to improved pharmacokinetic properties.
@highlight The elevated internalization increases the cytotoxicity of the ADC conjugates.
