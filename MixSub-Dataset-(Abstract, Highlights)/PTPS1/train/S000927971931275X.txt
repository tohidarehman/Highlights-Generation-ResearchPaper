 Gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity has been well documented although the causing mechanisms and preventative measures need further investigation . The current study aimed to explore the potential protective impacts of celecoxib a selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor on gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity and the potential mechanisms in rats . Rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows group1 normal control group 2 received gentamicin only group 3 concurrently received gentamicin and celecoxib and group 4 received celecoxib .

@highlight Celecoxib has an ameliorative effect against gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity.
@highlight Celecoxib increased urine Cr and CCr serum albumin GSH and SOD.
@highlight Celecoxib lowered kidney weight RSI proteinuria serum Cr BUN LDH MDA and NOx.
@highlight Celecoxib decreased NFB p65 TNF P53 and caspase 3 and COX 2 immunoreactivity.
@highlight Celecoxib suppressed renal MPO improved histological features and decreased HSP70.
