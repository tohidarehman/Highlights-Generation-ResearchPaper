 In recent years piperine has attracted much attention due to its various biological effects as a neuroprotective agent . Therefore clarification of the possible side effects of piperine is important to identify its potential pharmacological action . Thus the effects of piperine on the long term plasticity of perforant pathway to dentate gyrus synapses were studied in hippocampus of an animal model of Alzheimer s disease .

@highlight High dose of piperine was induced an impairment of learning and memory behavioral study.
@highlight High dose of piperine was exacerbated the basal synaptic activity and short term synaptic facilitation in animal models of Alzheimer s disease.
@highlight Unlike the neuroprotective effect piperine low dose high dose piperine was abolished hippocampal LTP at the perforant pathway to dentate gyrus synapses in rat model of ICV STZ induced Alzheimers disease.
@highlight High dose piperine was decreased significantly the neuronal density in different regions of hippocampus in ICV STZ injected rats.
