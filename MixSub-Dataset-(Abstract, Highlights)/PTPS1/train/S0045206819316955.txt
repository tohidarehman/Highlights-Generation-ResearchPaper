 The phosphoinositide 3 kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin have been regarded as promising targets for the treatment of cancer . Herein we synthesized a new series of substituted 2 1 3 5 triazine derivatives as novel PI3K mTOR dual inhibitors for cancer therapy . All compounds were evaluated for the IC

@highlight A series of substituted 2 thiophen 2 yl 1 3 5 triazine derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Most of the synthesized compounds showed moderate to significant anti tumor activity.
@highlight Compound
@highlight showed excellent inhibitory activity to against PI3K and mTOR kinases.
@highlight Compound
@highlight had an approximately 10 fold improvement in mTOR inhibition.
@highlight Compound
@highlight could stimulate A549 cells arrest at G0 G1 phase and induced apoptosis.
