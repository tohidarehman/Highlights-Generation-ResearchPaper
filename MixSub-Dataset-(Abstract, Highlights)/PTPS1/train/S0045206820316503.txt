 PDE5 targeting represents a new and promising strategy for apoptosis induction and inhibition of tumor cell growth due to its over expression in diverse types of human carcinomas . Accordingly we report the synthesis of series of pyrazolo 3 4

@highlight A novel series pyrazolo 3 4 
@highlight  pyrimidin 4 one carrying quinoline scaffold were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Compound
@highlight had strong anticancer and PDE5 inhibitory activities.
@highlight Compound
@highlight strongly inhibited Wnt catenin pathway.
@highlight Compound
@highlight caused pre G1 apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2 M phase.
@highlight A strong correlation between the antiproliferative and PDE5 inhibitory activities has been established.
