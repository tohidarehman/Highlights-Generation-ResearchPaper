 Cantharidin is a traditional Chinese medicine that shows an anticancer effects in multiple types of cancer cells . However the mechanism of CTD anti cancer function in gastric cancer is still unclear . The aim of the present study was to investigate the underlying mechanism that CTD inhibits proliferation and migration through suppression of the PI3K Akt signaling . CTD induced GC cell apoptosis and inhibited metastasis measured by CCK8 assays as well as wound healing assays and transwell assays . Mechanistic investigations suggested that CTD modulated the PI3K Akt signaling via western blot and quantitative q PCR . In addition we identified and confirmed CCAT1 as a novel direct target of CTD inhibited PI3K AKt signaling expression . In conclusion our results provide new point into the critical role of CTD in suppressing PI3K Akt signaling via down regulation of CCAT1 resulting in suppression GC cell growth and migration invasion .

@highlight Cantharidin suppressed MGC803 and BGC823cell metastasis by inhibiting PI3K Akt signal pathway in vitro.
@highlight Down regulated CCAT1 by cantharidin may inhibit gastric cancer metastasis.
@highlight CCAT1 may regulate PI3K Akt signal pathway in gastric cancer cell.
