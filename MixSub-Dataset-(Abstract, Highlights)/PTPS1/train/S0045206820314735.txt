 Despite the fact that the introduction of a fluorine atom at the C 6 position has resulted in the evolution of fluoroquinolones fluoroquinolone induced cardiac toxicity has drawn considerable attention . In this context desfluoroquinolone based hybrids with involvement of C 7 aminopyrimidine functional group were designed and synthesized . The biological results showed majority of these hybrids still demonstrated potent anti MRSA activity with MIC values between 0.38 and 1.5g mL despite the lack of the typical C 6 fluorine atom . Particularly the most active
