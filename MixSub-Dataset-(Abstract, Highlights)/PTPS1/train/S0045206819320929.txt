 We describe herein the synthesis characterization and biological studies of novel PEGylated triarylmethanes . Non symmetrical and symmetrical triarylmethanes series have been synthesized by Friedel Crafts hydroxyalkylation or directly from bisacodyl respectively followed by a functionalization with PEG fragments in order to increase bioavailability and biological effectiveness . The antimicrobial activity was investigated against Gram positive and Gram negative foodborne pathogens and against

@highlight Two original series of PEGylated triarylmethanes have been synthesized.
@highlight The PEGylated triarylmethanes evaluated exhibit excellent biocidal properties.
@highlight Docking studies revealed DHFR and DNA gyrase B as potential antibacterial targets.
