 A previous study demonstrated that glutathione produces specific antidepressant like effect in the forced swimming test a predictive test of antidepressant activity . The present study investigated the involvement of multiple cellular targets implicated in the antidepressant like effect of GSH in the FST . The antidepressant like effect of GSH 300 nmol site

@highlight GSH produces synergistic antidepressant effect when combined with antidepressants.
@highlight NMDAR NOS pathway inhibition is implicated in the antidepressant effect of GSH.
@highlight GABA receptors are involved in the antidepressant like effect of GSH.
@highlight 1 adrenoceptor activation is associated to GSH antidepressant effect.
@highlight Redox mediated signaling on the membrane receptors could be new antidepressant target.
