 This study was aimed to investigate the cytotoxic potential of a natural compound progenin III on a broad range of cancer cell lines including various sensitive and drug resistant phenotypes . The cytotoxicity progenin III induced autophagic ferroptotic and necroptotic cell death were evaluated by the resazurin reduction assay . Spectrophotometric analysis of caspases activity was performed using caspase Glo assay . Flow cytometry was applied for cell cycle analysis apoptosis mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species H

@highlight The cytotoxicity of a naturally occuring spirostanol saponin progenin III was evaluated.
@highlight Progenin III exerted cytotoxic effects towards the 18 cancer cell lines tested including animal and human cell lines.
@highlight Progenin III induced apoptosis autophagy and necroptosis in CCRF CEM cells.
