 Hyperproliferation and oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia in mesangial cells plays crucial roles in the pathological process of diabetic nephropathy . Farrerol isolated from rhododendron leaves possesses broad anti oxidative and anti inflammatory properties towards several diseases but its role in diabetic neuropathy remains unclear . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of farrerol in high glucose induced mesangial cell injury and to explore underlying molecular mechanisms . Our results showed that high glucose

@highlight HG stimulated MC proliferation inflammation ECM deposition and ROS production.
@highlight FAR dose dependently inhibited HG induced MC proliferation and ECM deposition.
@highlight FAR exerted anti oxidative effect on HG induced MCs via modulating ROS Nox4 ERK.
@highlight TGF 1 Smad2 was involved in FAR Nox4 mediated ECM deposition in HG induced MCs.
