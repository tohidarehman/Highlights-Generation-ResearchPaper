 A structure activity relationship study of cyclocurcumin derived diaryl dihydropyrone based inhibitors of amyloid aggregation is described . Optimization of the diaryl dihydropyrone framework and two phenolic rings resulted in the identification of diaryl dihydropyrone type cyclocurcumin analogue AY1511 which exhibited potent anti amyloid aggregation activity sufficient water solubility and low cytotoxicity .

@highlight A series of diarylpyrone derivatives were derived from cyclocurcumin.
@highlight AY1511 
@highlight  exhibits good water solubility and good stability.
@highlight Diaryl dihydropyrone framework is new type A aggregation inhibitors.
