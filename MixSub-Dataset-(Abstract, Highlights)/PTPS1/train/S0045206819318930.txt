 Fluorine is a unique atom that imparts distinct properties to bioactive molecules upon incorporation . Herein we prepare and study fluorinated derivatives of the nanomolar affine peripherally restricted dual CB

@highlight Synthesis and
@highlight evaluation of fluorinated cannabinoid analogs of CRA13.
@highlight Compound
@highlight possess higher binding affinity relative to CRA13 against CB
@highlight R and CB
@highlight R by 6.95 and 5.64 folds.
@highlight Pharmacokinetics of
@highlight F labeled compound
@highlight proved suitable distribution to peripheral tissues and limited to CNS.
@highlight This study suggests
@highlight F labeled compound
@highlight as universal PET imaging agent of peripheral cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors.
