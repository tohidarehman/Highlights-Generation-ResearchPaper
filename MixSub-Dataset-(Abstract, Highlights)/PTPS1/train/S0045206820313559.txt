 Truxinic acid sucrose diesters analogs possess interesting chemical structure by the presence of cyclobutane ring and macrocyclic sucrose diesters moieties which are rarely found from natural sources . This paper describes the isolation and structural elucidation of four new sucrose diesters of substituted truxinic acids trigohonbanosides A D
