 Hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury is not only one of the pathophysiological process involving the liver but also a complex systemic process affecting multiple tissues and organs . IRI after liver transplant occurs due to in major resections and occlusion of vessels or during the perioperative period leads to acute liver failure which shows the dynamic process that involves two interrelated phases of local ischemic insult and inflammation mediated reperfusion injury and has an impact on morbidity and mortality . The renin angiotensin aldosterone system is activated locally in the injured cells by the occurrence of I R which plays an essential role in the fate of the damaged tissue . However a preclinical study explores the protective role of RAAS inhibitor in acute liver injury in a model of inflammation caused by ischemia and reperfusion . In addition to RAAS blockers in monotherapy does not effectively block the complete pathway . Thus the present study is designed to explore the effect of combined folic acid with RAAS blockers in combination produce a synergistic effect . Moreover in this review we will describe the understanding of the possible incidence of downregulatory molecular mechanisms associated with renin angiotensin aldosterone system and the significance outcome of the combination of folic acid and RAAS blockers in liver injury due to ischemia reperfusion .

@highlight The ischemia reperfusion damage represents a severe problem in the clinical practice due to several reasons.
@highlight RAAS is activated locally in the injured cells by the occurrence of I R.
@highlight ROS generation causes cell damage and leads to cell death via autophagy necrosis necroptosis and apoptosis.
