 Inflammation plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of various diseases like atherosclerosis rheumatoid arthritis asthma and cancer . Lack of anti inflammatory drugs and vectors provokes the need for developing new molecules for the management of inflammatory disorders . Nanotechnology has emerged as a wonderful research area in the past decade owing to its enhanced properties than bulk counterparts . This paper discusses the green synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticle and various characterization tools employed to comprehend the physiochemical properties of nanoparticles . ZnO NPs interaction with cells and its pharmacokinetic behavior inside the cells has also been discussed . The anti inflammatory activity of ZnO NPs has been elucidated with the mechanism based approach . A concise literature review has been included which summarizes the size shape of ZnO NPs and the inflammatory model used for analyzing the anti inflammatory activity of ZnO NPs . ZnO NPs potential offering towards anti inflammatory activity like stable nature selective targeting has been discussed briefly . The present study highlights the potential of ZnO NPs as an anti inflammatory drug molecule or a vector for drug delivery .
