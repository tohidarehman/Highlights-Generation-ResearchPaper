 motor neurons are a target of the environmental neurotoxicant methylmercury accumulating MeHg and subsequently degenerating . In mouse spinal cord MN cultures MeHg increased intracellular Ca

@highlight HiPSC MNs are sensitive to acute MeHg exposure.
@highlight Acute MeHg exposure leads to a concentration dependent cell death in hiPSC MNs.
@highlight MeHg induced increases in Ca
@highlight in hiPSC MNs are mediated in part by AMPARs.
