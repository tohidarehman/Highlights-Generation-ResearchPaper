 Today Alzheimers disease as the most prevalent type of dementia turns into one of the most severe health problems . Neurofibrillary tangle mostly comprised of fibrils formed by Tau is a hallmark of a class of neurodegenerative diseases . Tau protein promotes assembly and makes stable microtubules that play a role in the appropriate function of neurons . Polyanionic cofactors such as heparin and azo dyes can induce aggregation of tau protein

@highlight Sunset yellow degradation products DPs accelerated Tau amyloid aggregation.
@highlight ADPs were more efficient than CDPs.
@highlight The current study provided evidence against the food colorant safety in terms of Triggered Amyloid Aggregation.
