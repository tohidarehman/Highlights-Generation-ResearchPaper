 Heart failure is an epidemic disease with increased incidence annually . It has been reported that taurine can improve cardiac function . This study investigated the cardioprotective effects of taurine in pressure loaded HF mice and elucidated the possible mechanism . HF models were established by transverse aortic constriction . Animals were treated with either taurine for 9 weeks and or the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 after TAC operation . Cardiac function and geometry were revealed by echocardiography . Myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis were assessed using Fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin staining and Masson s trichrome staining . Western blot and RT PCR were performed to elucidate the expression of target proteins and genes respectively . Apoptosis in cardiomyocytes was detected by TUNEL staining . Myocardial oxidative stress was assessed by detecting the concentration of myocardial super oxidative dismutase and malonyldialdehyde and reactive oxygen species . Taurine concentrations and NAD Taurine notably relieved cardiac dysfunction after TAC . The mechanisms were attributed to reduced myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis and alleviated apoptosis and oxidative stress . Meanwhile taurine increased NAD NADH ratiopromoted the expression of SIRT1 and suppressed p53 acetylation . However EX 527 decreased NAD The mechanism responsible for cardiac protective effects of taurine in HF induced by pressure overload is associated with the activation of the SIRT1p53 pathway .

@highlight Taurine can improve cardiac function of HF mice.
@highlight Taurine concentration dependently activated the SIRT1 expression in TAC mice.
@highlight Taurine inhibited pressure overload induced p53 acetylation via a SIRT1 pathway.
