 Combining two bioactive moieties by covalent bond into a novel single hybrid biological entity in view of the principle of active splicing twenty two C28 modified derivatives of pentacyclic dihydroxytriterpene carboxylic acids with saturated nitrogen heterocycle segments have been synthesized . The inhibitory activities of all final target compounds on glucosidase were evaluated

@highlight coupled with 1 deoxynojirimycin or piperazines were synthesized.
@highlight  Glucosidase inhibitory activities of the derivatives were evaluated
@highlight Eight derivatives presented higher inhibitory activity than that of precursors.
@highlight Compound
@highlight exhibited a better inhibitory than that of precursors and acarbose.
