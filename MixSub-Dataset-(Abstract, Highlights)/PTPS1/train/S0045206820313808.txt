 Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem . It causes ill health among millions of people each year and rank as the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide after the human immunodeficiency virus . Shikimate kinase is one of the major enzymes targeted for TB . Most approaches to overcome TB were based on synthesis and screening of a known compounds to obtain a few representatives with desired potency . In this study we have applied a virtual screening approach which combines ligand and structure based approaches to screen a large library of compounds as a starting point for the identification of new scaffolds for the development of shikimate kinase inhibitors . The combined approach has identified

@highlight Virtual screening combined with ligand and structure based approaches were employed.
@highlight Identification of new scaffold for the development of shikimate kinase inhibitors.
@highlight Seventeen compounds were synthesised and evaluated for shikimate kinase enzyme inhibition.
