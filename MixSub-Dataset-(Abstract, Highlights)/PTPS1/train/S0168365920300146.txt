 The buccal route is considered patient friendly due to its non invasive nature and ease of administration . Such delivery route has been used as an alternative for the delivery of drugs that undergo first pass metabolism or are susceptible to pH and enzymatic degradation such as occurs in the gastrointestinal tract . However the drug concentration absorbed in the buccal mucosa is often low to obtain an acceptable therapeutic effect mainly due to the saliva turnover tongue and masticatory movements phonation enzymatic degradation and lack of epithelium permeation . Therefore the encapsulation of drugs into nanoparticles is an important strategy to avoid such problems and improve their buccal delivery . Different materials from lipids to natural or synthetic polymers and others have been used to protect and deliver drugs in a sustained controlled or targeted manner and enhance their uptake through the buccal mucosa improving their bioavailability and therapeutic outcome . Overall the main aim of this review is to perform an overview about the nanotechnological approaches developed so far to improve the buccal delivery of drugs . Herein several types of nanoparticles and delivery strategies are addressed and a special focus on pipeline products is also given .
