 Topical instillation of eye drops remains the most common and easiest route of ocular drug administration representing the treatment of choice for many ocular diseases . Nevertheless low ocular bioavailability of topically applied drug molecules can considerably limit their efficacy . Over the last several decades numerous drug delivery systems have been developed in order to improve drug bioavailability on the ocular surfaces . This review systematically covers the most recent advances of DDS applicable by topical instillation that have shown better performance in

@highlight Eye drops have limited efficacy due to the unique physio anatomy of the eye.
@highlight Advances in polymer science have led to development of new drug delivery systems.
@highlight These systems show improved ocular drug penetration and retention in animal models.
@highlight Increased bioavailability could reduce dose regimen and side effects for patients.
@highlight Better manufacturing processes are essential for successful clinical translation.
