 Inhibiting VEGFR 2 has been set up as a therapeutic strategy for treatment of cancer . Accordingly new quinazoline based derivatives having the structural features of VEGFR 2 inhibitors were designed and synthesized . Anti proliferative activities were evaluated against three human cancer cell lines using MTT assay method . Doxorubicin and sorafenib were used as positive controls . Compounds

@highlight Twenty four compounds of novel quinazolin 4 3
@highlight  one derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Cytotoxic activities were evaluated against HepG 2 MCF 7 and HCT 116 cell lines.
@highlight anti VEGFR 2 and
@highlight antitumor activities were evaluated.
@highlight Molecular docking studies were carried out.
