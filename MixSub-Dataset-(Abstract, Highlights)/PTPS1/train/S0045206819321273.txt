 We have designed and synthesized 2 methoxy 3 quinoline containing amino carbinols as possible anti tubercular agents to combat the disease . These molecules were synthesized by tethering amino ether linkage with hydroxyl group to diarylquinoline skeleton hydroxyl and amine chains were engrafted on diaryl ring . They were evaluated against strain H

@highlight New series of 2 methoxy 3 thiophen 2 ylmethyl quinoline containing amino carbinols.
@highlight Two compounds are promising as anti TB agents against strain H
