 Indocyanine green a safe and clinically approved near infrared dye was recently explored as a potential photosensitizer due to its excellent photophysical properties . However ICG tends to form aggregations in physiological solution causing fluorescence quenching fast blood clearance and thereby inefficient tumor accumulation . Herein we report ICG based nanodrug delivery systems formed by self assembly of ICG and chemotherapeutic drugs without any excipients for combined chemo and photo therapy . Taking advantage of the amphiphilic aromatic structure ICG readily bounded with hydrophobic aromatic drugs such as SN38 and formed well dispersible nanoparticles which reduced its aggregation induced quenching and thus greatly improved its photodynamic efficiency . The loaded hydrophobic drugs elicited chemotherapy synergizing the photodynamic therapy giving rise to much enhanced antitumor activity

@highlight Clinically approved amphiphilic drugs ICG was used to solubilize hydrophobic drugs SN38 .
@highlight ICG SN38 nanoformulations have a well defined structure good batch to batch reproductivity and high drug loading capacity.
@highlight ICG SN38 nanoformulations showed improved photophysical properties.
@highlight ICG SN38 nanoformulations completely eradicated mice tumors by chemo photo combination therapy.
