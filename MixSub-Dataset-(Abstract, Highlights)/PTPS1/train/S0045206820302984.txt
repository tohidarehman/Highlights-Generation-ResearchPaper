 Lysine specific demethylase 1 is frequently elevated in acute myeloid leukemia and often leads to tumorigenesis . In recent years numerous LSD1 inhibitors based on tranylcypromine scaffolding have reached clinical trials . Most TCP derivatives were modified at the amino site of cyclopropane motif . Herein we for the first time introduced a sulfonamide group in TCP benzene ring of series

@highlight 21 novel TCP derivatives led to a potent LSD1 inhibitor with IC
@highlight of 29nM.
@highlight Boc was a potential prodrug group enhancing cellular uptake of LSD1 inhibitors.
@highlight Appropriate lipophilicity and potent LSD1 inhibition improved anticancer effect.
