 Juglone and thymoquinone are cytotoxic to pancreatic cancer cells . The aim of this study was to investigate using an analysis of isobolograms the type and degree of interactions between juglone and thymoquinone on MIA PaCa 2 pancreatic cancer cells . Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay . Cell death was determined by flow cytometry . The IC

@highlight Juglone and thymoquinone are cytotoxic to pancreatic cancer cells.
@highlight IC
