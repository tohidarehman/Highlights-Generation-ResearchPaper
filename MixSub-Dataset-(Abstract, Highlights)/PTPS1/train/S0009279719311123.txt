 Lithium and cannabinoids can disrupt learning and memory performance . The goal of the present study is to investigate the additive or synergistic effect of lithium and cannabinoid combination doses on spatial learning and memory in rats by isobolographic analyses . Although several studies have suggested synergistic effects of cannabinoids or lithium in response to other compounds in most of them isobolographic analyses were not used Thus there is a need for more detailed studies using isobolographic analyses . In this study spatial memory was evaluated in the Morris Water Maze apparatus by eight trials in the training day and one trial in the test day . Lithium was injected intraperitoneal and ACPA was injected into the dorsal hippocampal region . For the isobolographic analyses the ED50 of lithium and ACPA was measured by linear regression analysis considering the doses were tested in our previous research . The results showed that combinations of low medium and high doses of lithium and ACPA had synergistic but not additive effect on spatial learning and spatial memory . In conclusion we suggest that combination doses of lithium and ACPA have synergistic but not additive effect on spatial learning and memory in the rat s dorsal hippocampal region .
