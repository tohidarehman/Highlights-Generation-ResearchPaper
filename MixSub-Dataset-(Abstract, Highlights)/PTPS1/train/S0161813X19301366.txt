 Parkinson s disease is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease . PD produces a pathological state in the intestine and disordered gut microbiota which may be important for the pathogenesis and progression of PD but it is not clear . To explore the conditions and characteristics of intestinal pathology and GM disorders when PD related injuries occur we used twice 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine subacute administration with an interval of 3 weeks . We observed the changes in intestinal and brain immune status intestinal barrier function and GM in different injury states one day one week and three weeks after the first stimulus and one day and one week after the second stimulus . Our study found that two subacute administrations of MPTP induced dopaminergic neuron injury and inflammation in the midbrain and ileum impaired intestinal barrier function and GM disorders closely related to administration . These changes recovered after the first administration but after repeated administration some indicators showed more dramatic changes than during the first administration . Our results suggest that the intestinal tract is sensitive to PD related injury and the GM is susceptible to disturbances caused by intestinal function which may be concerned in local immune disorders of the intestine .

@highlight PD model mice were built with twice subacute MPTP administration.
@highlight Mice had dopaminergic neurodegeneration in midbrain and ileum.
@highlight Mice had inflammation in the midbrain and ileum.
@highlight Mice had intestinal barrier function impaired.
@highlight Mice had gut microbiota disorders.
