 Diketopiperazines have been regarded as an important scaffold from the viewpoint of synthesis due to their biological properties for the treatment of several diseases including cancer . In this work two novel series of enantiomeric 2 6 DKPs derived from amino acids were synthesized through nucleophilic substitution and intramolecular cyclization reactions . All the compounds were docked against histone deacetylase 8 which is a promising target for the development of anticancer drugs . These compounds bound into the active site of HDAC8 in a similar way to Trichostatin A which is an HDAC8 inhibitor . This study showed that the conformation of the 2 6 DKP ring stereochemistry and the type of substituent on the chiral center had an important role in the binding modes . The Gibbs free energies and dissociation constants values of HDAC8 ligand complexes showed that compounds
