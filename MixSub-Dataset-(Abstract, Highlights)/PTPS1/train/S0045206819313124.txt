 With the emergence of multi drug resistant bacteria and hospital acquired infections there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics . Here we report the synthesis physico chemical characterizations and antimicrobial activity assays of four Azo compounds that differ in their alkyl chain length . The molecular mechanism of their antibacterial activity was investigated by complementary

@highlight Cationic azobenzenes with a 4 or 6 carbons chain display a high antibacterial activity.
@highlight The antibacterial activity is linked to their interaction with the bacterial membrane.
@highlight Phosphatidylethanolamine in the bacterial membrane plays a role in this activity.
