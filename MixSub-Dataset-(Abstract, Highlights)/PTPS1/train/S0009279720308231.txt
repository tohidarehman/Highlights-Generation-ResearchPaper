 Ischemia reperfusion injury causes oxidative stress leading to severe cardiac dysfunction . Thus biologically active compounds with antioxidant properties may be viewed as a promising therapeutic strategy against oxidative related cardiac disorders . Usnic acid a natural antioxidant was complexed with cyclodextrin to improve its bioavailability . Wistar male rats were orally treated with the free form of UA or the inclusion complex UA CD for seven consecutive days . Afterward hearts were subjected to I R injury and the cardiac contractility rhythmicity infarct size and antioxidant enzyme activities were evaluated . Here we show that neither UA nor UA CD treatments developed signs of toxicity . After I R injury animals treated with UA CD showed improved post ischemic cardiac functional recovery while the release of cell injury biomarkers decreased . Following reduced cardiac damage a lower incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and smaller myocardial infarct size were associated with reduced lipid peroxidation along with preserved activity of antioxidant enzymes compared to untreated rats . Surprisingly uncomplexed UA did not protect hearts against IR injury . Altogether our results indicate that the inclusion complex UA CD is a critical determining factor responsible for the cardioprotection action of UA suggesting the involvement of an antioxidant dependent mechanisms . Moreover our findings support that UA CD is a structurally engineered compound with active cardioprotective properties .

@highlight UA CD inclusion complex enhances the aqueous solubility of UA.
@highlight Uncomplexed UA has no cardioprotective properties.
@highlight UA CD inclusion complex protects hearts against myocardial IR injury.
@highlight UA CD is a structurally engineered compound with active cardioprotective properties.
