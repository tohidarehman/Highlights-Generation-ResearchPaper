 Elevated oxidative stress is a representative hallmark of tumor cells . The development of redox responsive nanovectors capable of being selectively activated in cancer cells has emerged as a popular approach to fabricate anticancer agents . However despite tremendous achievements of redox responsive nanotherapeutics many of them suffer from limited therapeutic efficacy due to the unsatisfactory selectivity of pathological tissues over normal ones . On the one hand although cytosolic glutathione is much higher than that in plasma the cytosolic GSH concentrations of cancer cells and healthy cells is not significantly different . On the other hand elevated ROS levels are not sufficient to selectively activate the therapeutic agents in cancer cells . To this end amplification of intracellular ROS levels to enhance the selective responsiveness of redox responsive nanotherapeutics in cancer cells is of increasing interest . In this Minireview redox responsive nanovectors responding to intracellular endogenous redox species is first briefly introduced . Subsequently the strategies to engineer cancer cells as intelligent nanoreactors aiming at amplification of intracellular oxidative stress by either boosting ROS generation and or suppressing antioxidation systems are discussed . These ROS generating platforms can be either directly used for chemodynamic therapy or be coupled with conventional redox responsive nanotherapeutics representing a novel and promising methodology to improve therapeutic efficacy .

@highlight Intracellular ROS plays a crucial role on cell functions and redox imbalance leads to cell dysfunction and apoptosis.
@highlight Intracellular oxidative stress could be modulated by boosting ROS generation and or inhibiting antioxidation systems.
@highlight Selective amplification of intracellular ROS could be used for cancer treatment.
