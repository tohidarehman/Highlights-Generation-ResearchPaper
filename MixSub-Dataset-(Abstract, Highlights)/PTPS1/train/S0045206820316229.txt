 In this article we describe the synthesis of 3 phenylquinoxaline 2 carbonitrile 1 4 dioxides bearing cyclic diamine residues at positions 6 or 7 the synthesis is based on the nucleophilic substitution of halogens . All synthesized 6 aminoquinoxaline 2 carbonitrile 1 4 dioxides

@highlight Novel water soluble quinoxaline 1 4 dioxides bearing diamine residues were obtained.
@highlight All derivatives showed great hypoxia selectivity against MCF7 and MDA MB 231 cells.
@highlight Most of the compounds have a high cytotoxicity against K562 and K562 4 MDR cells.
@highlight Compound
@highlight suppresses HIF 1 and induces apoptosis in hypoxic tumor cells.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight demonstrate strong antiestrogenic potency in MCF7 cells.
