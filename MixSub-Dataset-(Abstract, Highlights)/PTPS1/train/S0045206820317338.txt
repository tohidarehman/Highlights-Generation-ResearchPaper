 This study aims to determine whether atomoxetine used as an alternative to methylphenidate affects superoxide dismutase activity besides glutathione and malondialdehyde levels apart from determining possible effects of ATX on SOD activity through molecular docking studies . 24 male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups each containing 6 members . After a 6 week application of ATX blood samples and brain tissues were obtained from the rats for biochemical analyses . Besides molecular docking studies were conducted using PyRx and Discovery Studio 3.0 programs . No significant difference occurred in GSH and MDA levels after ATX application . A high dose application of ATX caused a statistically significant change only in the serum SOD activity compared to that of Control Group . Molecular docking studies revealed that ATX settled in the biggest space rather than the catalytic regions of Cu

@highlight ATX had no ill effects on the antioxidant defence system in low and therapeutic doses.
@highlight studies showed that Atomoxetine did not occupy the active sites of Cu
@highlight Zn
@highlight  SOD.
@highlight Atomoxetine may be an alternative to methylphenidate for the long term treatment of ADHD.
