 It remains a major challenge to prime the cytotoxic T lymphocytes response for the treatment of Hepatitis B virus infection . Inspired by an important natural biological behavior membrane fusion we constructed a pH responsive nanocarrier HBsAg

@highlight The HBsAg delivery system was endowed with a pH responsive liposome and a synergistic strategy with CpG.
@highlight The membrane fusion event of liposome was uncovered in a dynamical and quantitative way.
@highlight The liposome improved HBsAg cytosolic trafficking and cross presentation activity.
@highlight An enhanced CTLs response was elicited.
