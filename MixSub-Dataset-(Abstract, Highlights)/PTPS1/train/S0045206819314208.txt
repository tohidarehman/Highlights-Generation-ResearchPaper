 Betulin is a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid possessing a lupane structure with a wide range of pharmacological activities . Its weak hydrosolubility hinders the biological activity of the compound and its derivatives . To circumvent this problem we synthesized and tested

@highlight First synthesis of novel compounds betulin 3 yl 2 amino 2 deoxy 
@highlight  and 
@highlight  galactopyranosides.
@highlight The structure of new saponins ware proved using spectroscopic techniques NMR and MS.
@highlight Cytotoxicity screening had been carried out against breast cancer MCF 7 and on the human dermal fibroblasts HDFa .
@highlight New compounds showed potent activity cytotoxicity IC
@highlight range from 1.74 to 89.44M.
@highlight The Ames test on mutagenic properties was completed.
