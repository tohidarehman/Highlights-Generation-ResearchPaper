 A very small number of cobalt complexes is examined in oncology research . In this work we investigate the cobalt salen complex

@highlight A cobalt salen complex named MBR 60 showed apoptotic activity over the intrinsic pathway in leukemia and lymphoma cells.
@highlight The cobalt free ligand did not affect tumor cells.
@highlight MBR 60 overcame multidrug resistances.
@highlight Outstanding synergistic effects of MBR 60 with daunorubicin and vincristine were observed.
