 USP8 one member of deubiquitinating enzymes families maintains the ubiquitination level of EGFR and regulates the downstream signaling pathways . The deregulation of USP8 has been implicated in many human diseases especially in cancer . Therefore USP8 has been identified as a promising target for drug design . Herein via high throughput screening based on Ubiquitin rhodamine 110 fluorometric activity assay we discovered a novel inhibitor

@highlight A novel USP8 inhibitor was identified via high throughput screening.
@highlight A Ubiquitin Rho 110 based platform for biochemical evaluation of USP8 activity was established.
@highlight Surface plasmon resonance assay demonstrated the interactions between
@highlight and USP8 catalytic domain.
@highlight Molecular docking revealed the binding mode between
@highlight and USP8 catalytic domain.
