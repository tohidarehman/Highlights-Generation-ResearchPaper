 Methamphetamine has been reported to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and neuronal apoptosis in the central nervous system during the development of addiction . Thioredoxin 1 is a redox regulating protein and plays an important role in inhibiting apoptosis and protects neurons from cytotoxicity through ER and mitochondria mediated pathways . Our previous study has been reported that Trx 1 protects mice from METH induced rewarding effect . However whether Trx 1 plays the role in resisting METH injury is still unclear . Here we aim to investigate whether Trx 1 participates in the regulation of METH induced CNS injury via ER stress and mitochondria mediated pathways . Our study first repeated the conditioned place preference expression induced by METH . Then we detected and found that METH increased the expression of

@highlight Trx 1 overexpression inhibits the increase of METH induced Glu and NR2B in VTA and NAc.
@highlight Trx 1 overexpression inhibits the expression of CHOP and GRP78 in VTA and NAc by METH.
@highlight Trx 1 overexpression inhibits the expression of Bcl 2 Bax in VTA and NAc by METH.
@highlight Trx 1 overexpression inhibits the decrease of procaspase12 Bcl 2 and procaspase3 in VTA and NAc by METH.
@highlight Trx 1 may block METH induced injury through regulating ER and mitochondria mediated apoptosis.
