 Huntington s disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by polyglutamine expansion in the Huntingtin levels reduced transglutaminase activity increased aconitase activity with increased tricarboxylic acid generated reducing equivalents and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes activity . Mitochondrial function was strengthened by increases in glycolysis pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and anaplerosis component represented by pyruvate carboxylase . These changes in mitochondrial function were associated with improved motor performance on the rotarod test . These findings suggest that exercise may have beneficial effects on motor behavior by reversing deficits in mitochondrial function in a rodent model of HD .

@highlight Treadmill running is associated increases of nitric oxide in brain homogenates.
@highlight Increases in nitric oxide result in inhibition of brain transglutaminase 2.
@highlight Inhibition of transglutaminase 2 results in increased glycolytic activity.
@highlight Inhibition of transglutaminase 2 results in increased bioenergetics.
@highlight Increased bioenergetics is associated with improved motor performance.
