 Treatment of inflammation using NSAIDs is coupled with a risk of severe gastric adverse events . Development of dual COX 2 5 LOX inhibitors turns out to be an imperative area devoted to safer NSAIDs . A series of thiourea thiazole and thiazolidene derivatives were synthesized by green synthetic approach and COX 1 COX 2 and 5 LOX inhibition screening resulted in the identification of a potent compound
