 Conventionally used antibiotics are present in low concentrations at the infection site and require multiple administrations to sustain a continuous bactericidal effect which not only increases their systemic toxicity but also results in bacterial drug resistance . In this study we first identified an interesting drug resistance mechanism mediated by bacterial outer membrane vesicles and then designed novel antibiotic loaded OMVs using this mechanism . We show that these antibiotic loaded OMVs can effectively enter and kill pathogenic bacteria

@highlight Bacteria excrete large amounts of antibiotic loaded vesicles through high efflux pump expression and OMV secretion.
@highlight OMVs effectively load antibiotics and improve antibiotic stability.
@highlight Antibiotic loaded OMV exert passive and active bactericidal effects through drug release and bacterial invasion.
@highlight Antibiotic loaded OMVs have excellent biocompatibility.
@highlight Antibiotic loaded OMVs can effectively protect against intestinal bacterial infections with oral administration.
