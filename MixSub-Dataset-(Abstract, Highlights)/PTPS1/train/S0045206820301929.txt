 A base mediated cascade reaction between malonate esters and acrolein was developed to access complex polycyclic systems . This novel tandem reaction enables the simultaneous generation of up to seven new bonds and at least three new stereogenic centers . Mechanistic studies indicate a series of nucleophilic 1 4 and 1 6 Michael addition reactions occur followed by an aldol condensation reaction culminating in the formation of three fused rings . The compounds were characterized by NMR studies and the stereochemistry was confirmed by X ray analysis . The ability to generate multigram quantities of such complex molecular scaffolds renders the method promising for medicinal chemistry campaigns . Herein we also demonstrate that the lead compounds display promising anti proliferative activities against human cancer cell models .

@highlight A base catalyzed cascade reaction sequence to higher molecular complexity was discovered.
@highlight The newly generated polycyclic molecular scaffold can potentially lead to enmein type isodon diterpenes.
@highlight Identification of new promising polycyclic compounds against multiple cancer cell lines.
