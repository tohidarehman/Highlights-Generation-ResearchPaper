 Some metabolic enzyme inhibitors can be used in the treatment of many diseases . Therefore synthesis and determination of alternative inhibitors are essential . In this study the inhibition effect of newly synthesized compounds on carbonic anhydrase cytosolic isoforms

@highlight A series of eleven bis sulphonamide substituted 1 3 5 triazine derivatives were reported.
@highlight The bis benzenesulfonamides incorporating 1 3 5 triazine derivatives were investigated as
@highlight CA I and
@highlight CA II GLY and AChE inhibitors.
@highlight Compound
@highlight showed great inhibition potency against
@highlight CA I and
@highlight CA II with
@highlight s of 51.674.76 and 40.355.74nM respectively.
@highlight Compound
@highlight displayed higher AChE inhibition potency with
@highlight of 335.7646.91nM.
@highlight Compound
@highlight was indicated great inhibition profile against the GLY with a
@highlight of 41.748.08nM.
