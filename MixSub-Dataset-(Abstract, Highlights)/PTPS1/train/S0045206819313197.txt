 Inhibitors of aldose reductase are rate limiting enzymes and could play a key role to prevent the complications of diabetes . In our attempt to develop novel inhibitors of aldose reductase the derivatives of rhodanine 3 hippuric acid pyrazole hybrid were synthesized and characterised by spectral data . The biological studies reveal that all the compounds show an excellent activity against ALR2 with IC

@highlight Novel rhodanine 3 hippuric acid derivatives were synthesized.
@highlight aldose reductase inhibitory activity was carried out for the synthesized compounds.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight are found to be more active and the IC
@highlight values are 0.04M and 0.06M.
@highlight All the compounds are well occupied in the receptor cavity.
