 A series of novel 2 substituted quinoline 4 carboxylic acids was synthesized by Doebner reaction starting from freely available protocatechuic aldehyde and vanillin precursors . Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase was recognised as a clear molecular target for these heterocycles . All compounds were also tested for their antiproliferative potential against three cancer cells and one normal cell line to evaluate the selective cytotoxicity . Quinoline derivatives

@highlight A new class of 2 substituted quinoline 4 carboxylic acids was synthesized.
@highlight Several compounds exhibited excellent hDHODH inhibition and good lipophilicity.
@highlight High cytotoxicity against MCF 7 and A375 cancer cell lines was observed.
@highlight Only one hydrophobic substituent led to high selectivity.
@highlight Molecular docking distinguished highly active from low active hDHODH inhibitors.
