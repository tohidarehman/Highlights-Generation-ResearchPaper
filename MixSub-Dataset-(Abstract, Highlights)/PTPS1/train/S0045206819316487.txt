 A series of 2 aryl 2 acetamides were synthesized and screened for their anticonvulsant activity in animal models of epilepsy . The compounds were broadly active in the classical maximal electroshock seizure and subcutaneous Metrazol tests as well as in the 6Hz and kindling models of pharmacoresistant seizures . Furthermore the compounds showed good therapeutic indices between anticonvulsant activity and motor impairment . Structure activity relationship trends clearly showed the highest activity resides in unsubstituted phenyl derivatives or compounds having

@highlight New anticonvulsant agents were derived from cardioactive Disopyramide DISO .
@highlight The compounds revealed high anticonvulsant activity in animal models.
@highlight The compounds act through inhibition of voltage gated sodium currents.
@highlight The compounds show superior cardiac safety to that of DISO.
