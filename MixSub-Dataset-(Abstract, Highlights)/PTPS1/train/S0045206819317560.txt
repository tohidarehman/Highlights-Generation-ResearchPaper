 Oxidative stress is the product or aetiology of various multifactorial diseases on the other hand the development of multifunctional compounds is a recognized strategy for the control of complex diseases . To this end a series of benzothiazole derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for their multifunctional effectiveness as antioxidant sunscreen antifungal and antiproliferative agents . Compounds were easily synthesized via condensation reaction between 2 aminothiophenols and different benzaldehydes . SAR study particularly in position 2 and 6 of benzothiazoles led to the identification of
