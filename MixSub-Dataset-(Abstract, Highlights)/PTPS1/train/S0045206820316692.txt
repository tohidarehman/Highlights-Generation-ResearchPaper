 Blocking c Met kinase activity by small molecule inhibitors has been identified as a promising approach for the treatment of cancers . Herein we described the design synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of 4 phenoxypyridine based 3 oxo 3 4 dihydroquinoxaline derivatives as c Met kinase inhibitors . Inhibitory activitives against c Met kinase evaluation indicated that most of compounds showed excellent c Met kinase activity

@highlight A series of novel 4 phenoxypyridine derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight The target compounds showed c Met kinase activities and cytotoxic activities.
@highlight Compound
@highlight showed an IC
@highlight value of 1.91nM against c Met kinase and more potent than foretinib.
@highlight The cytotoxic activities of
@highlight were more potent than foretinib against HT 29 cells.
@highlight Compound
@highlight could induce cells apoptosis and inhibit cells motility.
