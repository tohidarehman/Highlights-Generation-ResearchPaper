 The development of 1 8 naphthalimide derivatives as DNA targeting anticancer agents is a rapidly growing area and has resulted in several derivatives entering into clinical trials . One of original recent developments is the use of boron clusters carboranes and metallacarboranes in the design of pharmacologically active molecules . In this direction several naphthalimide carborane and metallacarborane conjugates were synthesized in the present study . Their effect on a cancer cell line cytotoxicity type of cell death cell cycle and ROS production were investigated . The tested conjugates revealed different activities than the leading members of the naphthalimides family namely mitonafide and pinafide . These derivatives could induce G0 G1 arrest and promote mainly apoptosis in HepG2 cell line . Our investigations demonstrated that the most promising molecule is

@highlight A series of naphthalimide carborane metallacarborane conjugates were synthesized.
@highlight First example of X ray analysis of naphthalimide carborane was established.
@highlight Naphthalimide with carborane more cytotoxic then those containing metallacarborane.
@highlight Compound
@highlight induced mitochondrial ROS generation in HepG2 cells.
