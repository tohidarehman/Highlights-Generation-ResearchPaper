 Graphene oxide and graphene based nanomaterials have been widely applied in recent years but their potential health risk and neurotoxic potentials remain poorly understood . In this study neurotoxic potential of GO and its underlying molecular and cellular mechanism were investigated using the nematode

@highlight Deposition of GO in the head region of
@highlight Increased ROS and decreased neurotransmitter contents by GO exposure.
@highlight Damage to AFD neuron by GO exposure.
@highlight Altered locomotive behavior by GO was rescued by AFD neuron mutants.
@highlight GO may possess neurotoxic potential.
