 Although rifampicin could have a hepatic toxic effect it has also been shown that this chemical acts as a cellular protectant against oxidative stress . Therefore we wondered whether rifampicin has a beneficial effect such as an anti oxidant in the liver because the efficacy of some drugs sometimes relates with their toxicity as well as protective effects . The present study aimed to investigate the antioxidant effect of rifampicin against arachidonic acid plus iron cotreatment and against acetaminophen induced oxidative stress

@highlight Rifampicin inhibited acetaminophen induced liver damage.
@highlight Rifampicin inhibited oxidative stress and mitochondria damage in hepatocyte.
@highlight Rifampicin activated AMPK related with LKB1 signals.
@highlight Rifampicin induced nuclear Nrf2 expression and antioxidant genes.
@highlight Rifampicin might be a pharmaceutical candidate for hepatic injury.
