 Somatostatin receptor targeted radionuclide therapy has become an effective treatment in patients with neuroendocrine tumors . Recently investigations on the development of antagonistic peptides are increasing with possible superior biological properties as opposed to the agonists . Herein we have reported the development of a new somatostatin receptor peptide ligand labeled with

@highlight Peptide sequences were designed by molecular docking study.
@highlight Using the 3 Benzothienylalanyl in antagonist improves the receptor binding affinity.
@highlight The radiolabeled antagonist showed more tumor uptake than the agonistic one.
@highlight Tumor of C6 glioma cells was visualized by the new radiolabeled antagonist.
