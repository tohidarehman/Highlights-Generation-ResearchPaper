 The crucial need for novel antitumor agents with high selectivity toward cancer cells has promoted us to synthesize new series of thiazole based chalcones and 4 hetarylthiazoles . The synthesis of thiazolyl chalcones and 4 hetarylthiazoles and the assertion of their structure are described . Their anti proliferative activity was estimated against three human cancer cell lines HepG 2 A549 and MCF 7 . 3 1 thiazol 4 yl prop 2 en 1 one chalcone derivative
