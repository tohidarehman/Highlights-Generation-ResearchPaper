 Human exposure to heavy metals is a potential risk for developing cognitive impairment . Aluminum foundry is one of industries that involve occupational exposure to different metals . to evaluate the cognitive performance of Aluminum foundry workers in relation to different metals exposure . a cross sectional study conducted on 75 Al foundry workers and 75 non occupationally exposed subjects as controls . Personal interview with specially designed questionnaire Assessment of cognitive functions done using Montreal cognitive assessment Stress depression and sleep were also assessed . Serum levels of Aluminum Lead manganese Zinc and tau protein were measured . Exposed group showed significant increase in serum levels of Aluminum lead Manganese and tau protein p value 0.005 with significant decrease of zinc level compared to control . There was a significant decrease MocA scores among exposed population . which was affected by serum levels of lead aluminum manganese and tau protein .Stress scores was higher in exposed workers than control but not affecting cognitive performance . occupational exposure to metals can cause cognitive dysfunction which may be subtle so there is a need for formal cognitive testing at baseline and on regular intervals during working period . Serum tau protein could be used as a prognostic biomarker for the hazardous effect of occupational exposure to these metals on the neuronal cells .

@highlight Occupational exposure to Aluminum and other metals has hazardous effect on cognitive functions.
@highlight Formal cognitive testing should be part of the routine checkup of the exposed workers done as a baseline test and on regular intervals during working periods.
@highlight Serum tau protein could be used as a biomarker for the hazardous effect of occupational exposure to Aluminum and other metals on the neuronal cells.
