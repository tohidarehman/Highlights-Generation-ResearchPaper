 Rheumatoid Arthritis affects approximately 1 of the total world population . Despite incessant research and development of new therapeutic agents management of RA is still a troublesome affair . Histone Deacetylase 1 is an epigenetic regulator which play important role in pathogenesis of RA . In present study we hypothesized that Phenethyl isothiocyanate a potent inhibitor of HDAC1 may ameliorate RA . Efficacy of PEITC was evaluated in Complete Freund s Adjuvant induced arthritis model in rats . CFA was injected subplantarly in the left hind paw on day 0 to all the groups except normal control . The administration of test drug PEITC and standard drug Ibuprofen started simultaneously and was continued for 21 days . Paw edema total arthritic index mobility score stair climbing ability behavioral parameters and bone erosion were evaluated . Further radiographic studies TNF alpha as well as HDAC1 levels in synovial tissue homogenate and histological analysis were performed . Prophylactic treatment of PEITC attenuated paw edema total arthritic index mobility score stair climbing ability behavioral parameters and bone erosion in dose dependent manner . Furthermore there was significant decrease in TNF alpha as well as HDAC1 levels in synovial tissue homogenate . Histological analysis revealed no cartilage damage bone erosion hyperplasia at synovial lining as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells in treatment group . Results of this study suggest potent anti rheumatoid arthritis activity of Phenethyl isothiocyanate in CFA induced RA model in rats .
