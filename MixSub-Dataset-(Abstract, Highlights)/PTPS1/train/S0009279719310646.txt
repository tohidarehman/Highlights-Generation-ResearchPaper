 Hemangioma is one of the commonest benign vascular tumors among children . Propranolol is the first line therapeutic drug for hemangioma . However the effects and mechanisms of propranolol in hemangioma have not been thoroughly elaborated . In this study the effects and mechanisms of propranolol were explored using hemangioma derived endothelial cells . The expression of GLUT1 were determined by immunofluorescence staining . qRT PCR assay was conducted to detect the mRNA expressions of angiopoietin 2 and Tie 2 . Western blot assay was carried out to measure the protein levels of Ang 2 Tie 2 protein kinase B and phospholyrated Akt . Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit 8 assay and Western blot of Ki67 protein level . Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry analysis and Western blot of Bax and Bcl 2 levels . We found that propranolol inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HemECs . Moreover propranolol inhibited the expressions of Ang 2 and Tie 2 in HUVECs and HemECs . Functional analysis revealed that Ang 2 attenuated the effects of propranolol on HemEC proliferation and apoptosis . Mechanistical analysis showed that propranolol inhibited the Akt pathway by regulating Ang 2 expression in HemECs . Futhermore inhibition of the Akt pathway attenuated the effects of Ang 2 on proliferation and apoptosis in HemECs . In conclusion propranolol inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of HemECs via Akt pathway by down regulating Ang 2 expression which contributes to our understanding on the pathogenesis of hemangioma and promotes the development of therapeutic approaches for hemangioma .
