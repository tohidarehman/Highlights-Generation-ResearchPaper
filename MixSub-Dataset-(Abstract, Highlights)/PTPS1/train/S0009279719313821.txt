 Relapse and drug resistance is still major challenges in the treatment of leukemia . Promethazine an antihistaminic phenothiazine derivative has been used to prevent chemotherapy induced emesis although there is no report about its antitumor potential . Thus we evaluated the promethazine cytotoxicity against several leukemia cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated . Promethazine exhibited potent and selective cytotoxicity against all leukemia cell types

@highlight Resistance to chemotherapy is a clinical challenge in leukemia therapy.
@highlight Antiallergic small molecule promethazine is used as antiemetic in cancer patients.
@highlight Promethazine induced a selective leukemia cell death through autophagy apoptosis.
@highlight For the first time the antitumor effects of promethazine were described.
