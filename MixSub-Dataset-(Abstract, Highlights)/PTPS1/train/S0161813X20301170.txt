 Exposure to fungicide ziram has been associated with increased incidence of Parkinsons disease . We recently demonstrated that the intranasal administration of sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate induces PD like behavioral and neurochemical alterations in mice . We now investigated the putative neuroprotective effects of melatonin on behavioral dificits and neurochemical alterations induced by i.n . NaDMDC . Melatonin treatment was given 1 h before NaDMDC administration during 4 consecutive days and we evaluated early and late NaDMDC induced behavioral and neurochemical alterations . Melatonin treatment protected against early motor and general neurological impairments observed in the open field and neurological score of severity respectively and late deficits in rotarod test . Melatonin prevented the NaDMDC induced alterations in the striatal tyrosine hydroxylase immunocontent . Melatonin also protected against increased levels of oxidative stress markers in the striatum as well as the NaDMDC induced increase of 4 hydroxynonenal and TNF markers of oxidative stress and inflammation respectively in the olfactory bulb . These results further detail the mechanisms underlying NaDMDC toxicity and demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of melatonin against the neuronal damage induced by NaDMDC .

@highlight Intranasal NaDMDC administration in mice induces motor impairments that lasts until 35 days.
@highlight Melatonin treatment protects against motor deficits induced by NaDMDC in early and late phases.
@highlight Melatonin reduces the oxidative nitrosative damages induced by NaDMDC in brain structures of mice.
@highlight The dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway was protect by melatonin treatment.
