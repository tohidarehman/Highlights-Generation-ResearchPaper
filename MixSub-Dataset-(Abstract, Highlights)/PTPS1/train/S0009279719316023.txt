 Endemic fluorosis is a serious problem in public health affecting thousands of people . Abnormal proliferation and activation of osteoblasts in skeletal fluorosis lesions play a leading role and osteoblast proliferation is finely regulated by the cell cycle . There are a few reports on fluoride induced DNA methylation . However the role of DNA methylation of the cyclin cyclin dependent kinase cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor regulatory network in skeletal fluorosis has not been investigated . We used a population study and

@highlight Fluoride exposure induced up regulation of
@highlight down regulation of
@highlight No changes in methylation status of
@highlight were found in fluoride exposure.
@highlight Down regulation of
@highlight induced by fluoride is attributable to its hypermethylation.
@highlight Hypermethylation of the
@highlight gene can serve as a potential biomarker for fluorosis.
