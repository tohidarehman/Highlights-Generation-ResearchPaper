 The objectives of the present work are to design syhthesize and introduce novel urea thiourea derivatives of 2 pyrimidine and 1 piperazine molecules as tobacco mosaic virus inhibitors . A series of urea thiourea derivatives containing pyrimidine and piperazine moieties were synthesized characterized using Fourier transform infrared mass spectra nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy elemental analysis and evaluated their sustainability using biological experiments . The anti viral bioassay of the title compounds showed an antiviral activity against TMV . The compounds synthesized

@highlight Firstly integrated piperazine and pyrimidine rings to urea and thiourea template.
@highlight Synthesized Urea thiourea derivatives are proved as anti tobacco mosaic viral compounds.
@highlight Docking and MDS affirmed the title compounds as novel inhibitors against TMVHel enzyme.
@highlight The presence of Pyrimidine and Piperazine moiety enriched high potentiality in active ones.
