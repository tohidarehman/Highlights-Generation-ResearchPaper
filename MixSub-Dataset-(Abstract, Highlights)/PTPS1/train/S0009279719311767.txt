 Liver fibrosis is a common pathological consequence of liver injury which increases liver failure related morbidity and mortality . Hence anti fibrotic treatment is urgently needed . Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the progression of liver fibrosis . Thus targeting ROS may be an effective strategy for liver fibrosis treatment . In this study we investigated four benzoquinones derivatives including 5 isopropyl 2 methyl 1 4 benzoquinone 2 tert butyl 1 4 benzoquinone

@highlight Benzoquinone derivatives exhibit anti liver fibrosis activity in TAA induced mice.
@highlight Having anti oxidant properties to regulate the redox balance of cells.
@highlight Inhibition of the oxidant stress in LX 2cells.
@highlight Alleviation of the TLR4 mediated inflammatory response.
@highlight Showing the ability that inducing the apoptosis of LX 2cells.
