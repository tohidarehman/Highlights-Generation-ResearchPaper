 Treatment resistant depression is by definition difficult to treat using standard therapeutic interventions . Recently esketamine has been shown as a viable rescue treatment option in patients in depressive crisis states . However IV administration is associated with a number of drawbacks and advanced delivery platforms could provide an alternative parenteral route of esketamine dosing in patients . Hydrogel forming microneedle arrays facilitate transdermal delivery of drugs by penetrating the outer layer of the skins surface absorbing interstitial skin fluid and swelling . This subsequently facilitates permeation of medicines into the dermal microcirculation . This paper outlines the
