 Reactive oxygen species is mainly produced as a by product from electron transport chain of mitochondria and effectively eliminated by cellular antioxidants . However 2 chloroethyl ethyl sulfide exposure to keratinocytes declined antioxidant capacity and increased accumulation of ROS triggered alteration of mitochondrial activity and apoptosis is lacking . Our findings demonstrated that the electron leakage from the impaired ETC leading to the accumulation of ROS was gradually elevating with increasing concentration of CEES exposure which decline the activity of superoxide dismutase manganese SOD and copper zinc SOD in keratinocytes . Further excess accumulation of ROS decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and increased the mitochondrial mass with increasing dose of CEES . CEES exposure provoked the decrease in expression of transcription factor A mitochondrial augmented mitochondrial DNA damage and altered the mtDNA encoded oxidative phosphorylation subunits . Moreover fragmented mtDNA translocated into cytosol where it activated cGAS STING and interferon regulatory factor3 coinciding with the increased expression of inflammatory mediators and alteration of cell to cell communication markers . Pre treatment of N acetyl

@highlight CEES exposure enhance electron leakage from mitochondria leading to ROS accumulation and decline the antioxidants activity.
@highlight Accumulated ROD due to CEES exposure augments decrease in m and increased in mitochondrial mass.
@highlight CEES exposure provoked mitochondrial dysfunctions in keratinocytes.
@highlight Fragmented mtDNA due to CEES exposure translocated into cytosol and activate signalling cascades.
@highlight Pre treatment of ROS or ERK1 2 or PI3K Akt inhibitors significantly restored the CEES effect.
