 Spinal cord injury induces pathological and inflammatory responses that create an inhibitory environment at the site of trauma resulting in axonal degeneration and functional disability . Combination therapies targeting multiple aspects of the injury will likely be more effective than single therapies to facilitate tissue regeneration after SCI . In this study we designed a dual delivery system consisting of a neuroprotective drug minocycline hydrochloride and a neuroregenerative drug paclitaxel to enhance tissue regeneration in a rat hemisection model of SCI . For this purpose PTX encapsulated poly lactic

@highlight A novel dual drug delivery system was designed for SCI therapy.
@highlight A combination of a neuroprotective and neuroregenerative drug was loaded as treatment.
@highlight A prolonged sustained release of two drugs was obtained over eight weeks.
@highlight The dual drug treatment reduced inflammation and increased neuronal regeneration.
@highlight The dual drug treatment improved functional outcomes.
