 Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders describe a wide range of ethanol induced developmental disabilities including craniofacial dysmorphology and neurochemical and behavioral impairments . Zebrafish has become a popular animal model to evaluate the long lasting effects of both severe and milder forms of FASD including alterations to neurotransmission . Glutamate is one of the most affected neurotransmitter systems in ethanol induced developmental disabilities . Therefore the aim of the present study was to evaluate the functionality of the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system in an adult zebrafish FASD model . Zebrafish larvae were exposed to ethanol for 2h . After 4 months the animals were euthanized and their brains were removed . The following variables were measured glutamate uptake glutamate binding glutamine synthetase activity Na K ATPase activity and high resolution respirometry . Embryonic ethanol exposure reduced Na dependent glutamate uptake in the zebrafish brain . This reduction was positively modulated by ceftriaxone treatment a beta lactam antibiotic that promotes the expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 . Moreover the 0.5 and 1 ethanol groups demonstrated reduced glutamate binding to brain membranes and decreased Na K ATPase activity in adulthood . In addition ethanol reduced glutamine synthetase activity in the 1 EtOH group . Embryonic ethanol exposure did not alter the immunocontent of the glutamate vesicular transporter VGLUT2 and the mitochondrial energetic metabolism of the brain in adulthood . Our results suggest that embryonic ethanol exposure may cause significant alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the adult zebrafish brain .
