 Contamination in estuarine regions affects the local biota damaging the ecosystems and reaching humans . The gastrointestinal tract is a dynamic environment capable of obtaining nutrients and energy from food while it protects the host against harmful toxins and pathogens from the external environment . These functions are modulated by the enteric nervous system and changes in its structure can result in gastrointestinal disorders . The objective of this study was to evaluate if the environmental contaminants have effects on the myenteric neuronal plasticity of pufferfish

@highlight Exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to environmental contaminants causes changes in myenteric neuronal plasticity.
@highlight Changes in nerve network shape neuronal density and areas of cellular profiles suggest changes in myenteric neuronal plasticity.
@highlight The intestine is in contact with environmental pollutants through the diet and can therefore be a good biomarker of contamination in fish.
@highlight Changes in myenteric neuronal plasticity by contact with environmental contaminants may compromise organism health.
