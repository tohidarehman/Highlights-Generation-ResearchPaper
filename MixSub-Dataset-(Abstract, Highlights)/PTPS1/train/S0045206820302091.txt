 Selenium nanoparticles have become one of the most prospective and promising tools in the course of cancer diagnosis and therapy . Here we describe the synthesis of a novel radioactive platform for tumor imaging using selenium nanoparticles . SeNPs were synthetized using dithionite and glutathione as reducing and capping agent respectively with 5mmol L sodium selenite as a precursor and then SeNPs radiolabeled with technetium 99m the most common and famous radioactive isotope used for imaging purposes . A characteristic profile for the synthesized SeNPs was performed including size analysis zeta potential antioxidant activity radiochemical yield and
