 Strategies for controlled delivery of therapeutic siRNA into living cells are in high demand as endosomal escape remains the most prominent bottleneck at the intracellular level . Photothermal properties of gold nanoparticles can be used to overcome the endosomal membrane barrier upon laser irradiation by two mechanisms endosomal rupture by mechanical energy from water vapor nanobubbles or permeabilization of the endosomal membrane by heat diffusion . Here we evaluated how both mechanisms influence cargo release transfection efficiency acute cytotoxicity and cell homeostasis . Using a siRNA AuNP drug delivery system we found that the in vitro release of siRNA from the AuNP carrier occurs equally efficiently by VNB formation or heat generation . Heat mediated endosomal escape happened more efficiently in cells that had more particles per endosome resulting in variable siRNA induced downregulation . VNB mediated endosomal escape did not dependent on the number of AuNP per endosome yielding high downregulations independent of the cell type . Effects on cell homeostasis by whole transcriptome analysis showed a quick recover after 24h or 48h for either of both photothermal mechanisms . We conclude that VNBs are more consistent to induce efficient endosomal escape and gene silencing independent of the cell type without long lasting effects on cell homeostasis .

@highlight Endosomal rupture by two distinct photothermal properties of gold nanoparticles AuNPs was studied vapor nanobubbles VNBs and heat diffusion .
@highlight siRNA was released intact and equally efficient from the carriers for both irradiation conditions.
@highlight VNB mediated endosomal escape yields high downregulations independent of the cell type.
@highlight Heat mediated endosomal escape depends on the number of AuNP per endosome which is cell type dependent.
@highlight Transcriptome analysis showed that neither of both photothermal phenomena induces long term changes in cell homeostasis.
