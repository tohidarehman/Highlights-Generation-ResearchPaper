 This report describes the synthesis of a library of fluorogenic carbapenemase substrates consisting of carbapenem derivatives fluorescence dyes and active cleavable linkers and their evaluation for specifically detecting carbapenemase producing organisms . We synthesized a series of compounds having three different types of linkers such as benzyl ether carbamate and amine using hydroxymethyl carbapenem

@highlight A library of carbapenem based fluorogenic probes having different active linkers were synthesized.
@highlight Probe
@highlight showed high stability and rapid fluorescence signal in the carbapenemase assay.
@highlight Probe
@highlight selectively detected the carbapenemase producing organisms in clinical screening.
