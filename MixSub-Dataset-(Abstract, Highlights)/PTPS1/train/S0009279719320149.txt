 The review summarizes literature data on the DNA binding DNA protecting and DNA damaging activities of a range of natural human endogenous and exogenous compounds . Small natural organic molecules bind DNA in a site specific mode by arranging tight touch with the structure of the major and minor grooves as well as individual bases in the local duplex DNA . Polyphenols are the best studied exogenous compounds from this point of view . Many of them demonstrate hormetic effects producing both beneficial and damaging effects . An attempt to establish the dependence of DNA damage or DNA protection on the concentration of the compound turned out to be successful for some polyphenols daidzein genistein and resveratrol which were DNA protecting in low concentrations and DNA damaging in high concentrations . There was no evident dependence on concentration for quercetin and kaempferol . Probably the DNA protecting effect is associated with the affinity to DNA . Caffeine and theophylline are DNA binders at the same time they favor DNA repair . Although most alkaloids damage DNA berberine can protect DNA against damage . Among the endogenous compounds hormones belonging to the amine class thyroid and steroid hormones appear to bind DNA and produce some DNA damage . Thus natural compounds continue to reveal beneficial or adverse effects on genome integrity and provide a promising source of therapeutic activities .

@highlight Numerous polyphenols and other natural compounds bind DNA
@highlight Small organic molecules that bind to DNA can both exogenous and endogenous.
@highlight The DNA binding compound can damage and protect DNA against other genotoxic agents.
@highlight Conditions when a compound damages or protects DNA are difficult to elucidate.
