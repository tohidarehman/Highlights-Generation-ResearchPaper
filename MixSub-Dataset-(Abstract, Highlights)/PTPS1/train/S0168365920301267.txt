 Subcutaneous delivery of biotherapeutics is well established as a route of administration across many therapeutic areas and has been shown to be effective and well tolerated . It can offer several advantages over intravenous administration . This notwithstanding there remain critical development issues and knowledge gaps in SC drug delivery . To articulate and address these issues the SC Drug Delivery and Development Consortium was convened in 2018 as a pre competitive collaboration of industry experts in drug delivery device development and commercialization . In this review we outline the Consortium s vision and mission in advancing the development of patient centered biotherapeutics and establishing a collaborative organization that facilitates open sharing of information and gives voice to diverse viewpoints from SC experts across industries and disciplines . Additionally we describe the current landscape and challenges associated with SC administration of therapeutic proteins and offer insights into potential solutions to these challenges within the context of 8 problem statements developed by the Consortium to highlight key gaps unmet needs and actionable issues . Current and future opportunities to accelerate progress in the field through technological advances and the development of drug delivery tools are also discussed .
