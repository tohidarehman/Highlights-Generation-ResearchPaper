 A set of new Schiff bases of N aryl 3 and 4 substituted maleimides has been prepared via condensation of N aryl 3 and 4 substituted maleimides with p toluene sulfonyl hydrazide in acidic medium at room temperature . The structures of synthesized compounds were characterized by IR

@highlight Novel Schiff bases of N aryl malemide derivaties were synthesized at acidic pH.
@highlight The novelty of this work is the synthesis was performed at mild condition i.e. room temperature than other reports.
@highlight The synthesized compound showed good antibacterial activity against
@highlight and
@highlight bacteria.
@highlight They also showed efficient antifungal activity towards
@highlight and
@highlight fungi.
@highlight We assume that due to high purity and efficient antimicrobial activity synthesized compounds can be used for different biological applications.
