 This study evaluates the possible protective effects of gallic acid and ferulic acid against an experimentally induced liver fibrosis by thioacetamide in rats . Animals were divided into Control group GaA group 20mg kg day

@highlight Gallic and ferulic acids prevent thioacetamide induced changes in the rat liver.
@highlight Gallic and ferulic acids inhibit TGF 1 Smad 3 signaling pathway.
@highlight Gallic and ferulic acids upregulate miR 30 and miR 200 while downregulate miR 21 expressions.
