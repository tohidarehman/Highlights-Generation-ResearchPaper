 The chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been explored as a drug target due to its involvement in pathological conditions such as HIV infection and cancer metastasis . Here we report the structureactivity relationship study of novel CXCR4 antagonists based on an aminoquinoline template . This template is devoid of the chiral center in the classical tetrahydroquinoline ring moiety and therefore can be easily synthesized . A number of potent CXCR4 antagonists were identified exemplified by compound

@highlight Aminoquinoline is identified as a novel scaffold for CXCR4 antagonists.
@highlight The synthesis is greatly simplified compares with classical tetrahydroquinoline.
@highlight Compound
@highlight competes with APC conjugate 12G5 for CXCR4 binding IC
@highlight  57nM .
@highlight Compound
@highlight inhibits CXCL12 induced cytosolic calcium increase IC
@highlight  0.24nM .
@highlight Compound
@highlight inhibits CXCR4 CXLC12 mediated chemotaxis in a transwell assay.
