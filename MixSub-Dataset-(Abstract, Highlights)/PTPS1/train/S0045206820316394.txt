 Caffeic acid ester derivatives have been widely found in propolis extract and plants . In this work the effect of ester groups with different aromatic and alkyl chains on the antioxidant activity of caffeic acid was performed on the double H

@highlight Antioxidative mechanisms were analysed for caffeic acid and its ester derivatives.
@highlight In weak polarity phases the dHAT mechanism is preferred to trap free radical.
@highlight In the polar phases the SdPLdET mechanism is more favoured.
@highlight O3H3O4 hydrogen bonds makes the 4OH more favourable to trap free radicals.
@highlight The ester group enhances the antioxidant capacities of caffeic acid.
