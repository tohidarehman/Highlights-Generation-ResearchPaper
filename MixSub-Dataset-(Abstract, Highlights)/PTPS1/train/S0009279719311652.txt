 Clopidogrel a clinically used antiplatelet agent can be readily hydrolyzed by human carboxylesterase 1A to release an inactive metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid . In this study clopidogrel was used as a tool substrate to investigate the interspecies variation of clopidogrel hydrolysis in hepatic microsomes from various mammals including human and six laboratory animals . The results demonstrated that clopidogrel could be hydrolyzed into CCA by all tested hepatic microsomes from human or other mammals but the hydrolytic rates greatly varied among species . Inhibition assays demonstrated that BNPP strongly inactivated clopidogrel hydrolytic activity in all tested hepatic microsomes suggested that mammalian CES were major contributor responsible for clopidogrel hydrolysis in hepatic preparations from all above mentioned species . By contrast the response of a reversible inhibitor of human CES1A on clopidogrel hydrolysis in these liver preparations varied significantly among different species . Moreover the enzymatic kinetics and the apparent kinetic parameters of clopidogrel hydrolysis in hepatic microsomes from various animal species were evaluated and compared to each other . These findings provide crucial information for deeply understanding the differences in catalytic behaviors of mammalian CES which will be very helpful for choosing suitable laboratory animal for whole tests of CES1A substrate drugs .
