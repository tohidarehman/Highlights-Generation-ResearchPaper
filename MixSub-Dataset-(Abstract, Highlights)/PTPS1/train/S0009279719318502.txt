 Adriamycin nephropathy model a rodent model of nephrotic syndrome disease that was caused by the nephrotoxicity of adriamycin has been widely used for pharmacodynamic evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of kidney injury . Although some studies have clearly shown the pathological process of AN the mechanism of kidney injury have not been systematically investigated . The reliability of AN was evaluated by weight urinary protein quantitation serum biochemical and histopathological examination . Transcriptomic sequencing combined with network pharmacology were used to elucidate the molecular mechanism of AN and cell experiment combined with real time quantitative PCR and was used to validate the accuracy of transcriptomic sequencing result and KEGG pathways . Network analysis result showed that Mapk10 and Ptgs2 played important roles in the development of adriamycin induced kidney injury . KEGG pathway analysis showed that the mechanism of kidney injury may be related to the regulation of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids complement and coagulation cascades PPAR signaling pathway and PI3K AKT signaling pathway . These results provide a new insight into the deep research on the mechanism of kidney injury and provide an experimental basis for finding drug targets for the treatment of AN .

@highlight Adriamycin nephrotic rat model can imitate human nephrotic syndrome.
@highlight A value based on topological parameters is to evaluate the importance of target.
@highlight The key target genes of adriamycin induced renal injury are Mapk10 and Ptgs2.
@highlight Regulation of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids is involved in kidney injury.
