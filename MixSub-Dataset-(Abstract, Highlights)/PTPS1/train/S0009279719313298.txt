 Multiple targeting compounds might reduce complex polypharmacy of multifactorial diseases such as diabetes and contribute to the greater therapeutic success . Targeting reactive oxygen species producing enzymes as xanthine oxidase might suppress progression of diabetes associated vascular complications . In this study a small series of benzimidazole derivatives

@highlight Two tested benzimidazoles inhibited DPP 4 and XO with IC
@highlight value lower than 200M.
@highlight Binding modes of both dual inhibitors with two target enzymes were predicted.
@highlight Assayed dual inhibitors were not cytotoxic to a greater extent for Caco 2cells.
