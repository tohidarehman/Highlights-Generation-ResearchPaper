 Resistance of pathogens to antimicrobials is a major current healthcare concern . In a series of linked studies we have investigated synthetic iron chelators based on hydroxy pyridinone ligands as novel bacteriostatic agents . Herein we describe our synthesis of several useful building blocks based on the 1 hydroxy 2 pyridinone moiety including a novel formyl derivative which were combined with a trisamine core to obtain a series of new high affinity hexadentate Fe chelators . The design principle examined by this series is the size and flexibility of the linker between the core and the metal ligands . Measurement of the pKa and stability constants Fe

@highlight Chelators based on 1 2 HOPO and TREN core were synthesised with varying linkers.
@highlight They were screened as biostatic agents and found to prevent growth of bacteria.
@highlight Gram positive and fungus were more susceptible than gram negative to the presence of the chelator.
@highlight The lag phase before growth was significantly increased in duration versus control.
