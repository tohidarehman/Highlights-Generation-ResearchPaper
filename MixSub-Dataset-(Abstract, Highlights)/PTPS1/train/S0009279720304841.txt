 Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related death worldwide . It has aggressive manifestation high ability to promote metastasis and late diagnosis . In the present study we investigated the cytotoxic effect of 3 3 5 5 tetramethoxybiphenyl 4 4diol against the A549 human non small cell lung carcinoma lineage . The A549cell line was treated for 72h with TMBP with and subsequently defined the 50 inhibitory concentration from which tests were performed to determine the viability volume and regulation of the cell cycle . Finally we investigated the death mechanisms involved in the action of the treatments by flow cytometry and fluorimetry . The TMBP treatment of primary cells peritoneal macrophages and sheep erythrocytes did not reduce the viability of these cells . On the other hand TMBP was able to reduce the viability of the investigated cell line by cytotoxic action and to promote the reduction of cell size . Subsequently we found that TMBP treatment was able to increase the production of reactive oxygen species cause mitochondrial depolarization induce cell cycle arrest in G2 M phase and lead to death by direct apoptosis . Thus this study revealed that TMBP could be a promising candidate for the development of antitumor drugs targeting lung cancer .

@highlight predictions showed good drug likeness potential for TMBP.
@highlight TMBP promotes cytotoxic action and changes in cell size in A549cells.
@highlight TMBP increases the production of ROS and disrupts the cell cycle in G2 M.
@highlight TMBP alters the m and. promotes formation of droplets lipid in A549.
@highlight Treatment with TMBP induces apoptosis in tumor cells.
