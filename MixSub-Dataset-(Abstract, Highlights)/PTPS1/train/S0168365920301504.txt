 Theranostic nanocarriers of antivascular drug encapsulated in thermosensitive ultramagnetic liposomes can be advantageously designed to provide a locally high concentration and an active delivery with image guided Magnetic Resonance Imaging so as to reliably cure tumor . We propose a novel therapeutic strategy consisting of the magnetic accumulation of Ultra Magnetic Liposomes

@highlight First magnetic thermosensitive liposomes encapsulating CA4P and magnetic nanoparticles.
@highlight Proof of concept of combined magnetic targeting HIFU drug release with CA4P magnetic liposomes.
@highlight Similar efficacy of targeted liposomes encapsulating CA4P as the free drug at a 150 lower dose.
@highlight MRI Engineering to evidence the efficiency of a novel theranostic liposome.
