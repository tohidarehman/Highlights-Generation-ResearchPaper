 Pyrroloquinoline quinone and its esterified derivative PQQ ester have potential to treat or diagnose neurological and psychological disorders . However their neurotoxicity remains unclear . To provide reference data for the brain targeting drug delivery techniques the cytotoxic effects of PQQ and PQQE were examined in primary mouse cortical neurons . The results indicated that both PQQ and PQQE decreased neuron viability reduced intracellular ATP level and disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential in a concentration and time dependent manner while PQQ was less potent than PQQE . PQQ and PQQE induced apoptosis involving increase of Bax decrease of Bcl 2 release of mitochondrial cytochrome C into the cytosol activation of caspase 3 and cleavage of PARP . A single mouse intracephalic injection of PQQ or PQQE showed similar results . Based on these findings high concentration PQQ or PQQE treatment could induce a wide range of neurotoxicity and apoptosis . The lowest observed adverse effect levels of PQQ and PQQE were 10 M and 2 M respectively and the no observed adverse effect levels were 5 M and 1 M respectively in mice cortical neurons .

@highlight High concentration PQQ or PQQE could induce a wide range of neurotoxicity.
@highlight PQQ or PQQE could induce mitochondrial dependent apoptosis in mice cortical neurons.
@highlight The toxicity of PQQE was more potent than PQQ on mice cortical neurons.
@highlight The LOAELs of PQQ and PQQE were 10 M and 2 M respectively in mice cortical neurons.
@highlight The NOAELs of PQQ and PQQE were 5 M and 1 M respectively in mice cortical neurons.
