 Despite the huge success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as anticancer agents severe side effects are a major problem . In order to overcome this drawback the first hypoxia activatable 2 nitroimidazole based prodrugs of the clinically approved ALK and c MET inhibitor crizotinib were developed . The 2 aminopyridine functionality of crizotinib was considered as ideal position for prodrug derivatization . Consequently two different prodrugs were synthesized with the nitroimidazole unit attached to crizotinib either via carbamoylation

@highlight Rational design of the first hypoxia activatable prodrugs of crizotinib.
@highlight Docking studies proposed the suppression of crucial interactions with ALK and c MET.
@highlight In a cell free kinase inhibition assay the activity was strongly reduced.
@highlight Improved selectivity to cancer cells and distinct phosphorylation inhibition
