 Tramadol intake related seizures have emerged as a common cause of seizures in Egypt affecting mainly young men . This study aimed to determine the percentage of tramadol induced seizures and to compare the clinical neurophysiological and radiological features of tramadol induced seizures group with idiopathic epilepsy group . Two phases study at first phase data analysis for all Kasr Alainy epilepsy clinic patients in Cairo during the period from January 2012 through June 2014 then at second phase a group of tramadol induced seizures patients were compared with a matching group of idiopathic epilepsy patients . Detailed history and examination laboratory tests electroencephalogram Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain and Hamilton depression rating scale were performed for both groups . Tramadol induced seizures represented 7 of all patients and 12 of male patients . All cases were males . Occupational driving was the most common job . Seizures were generalized tonic clonic in 86 . Seventy seven percent of tramadol induced seizures developed with toxic tramadol dose . Inter ictal EEG was normal in most patients . Depression and EEG abnormalities were significantly less than idiopathic epilepsy patients . MRI brain for both groups was normal . Tramadol induced seizures represented 7 of cases . This deviates the attention to the problem of tramadol addiction in Egypt and raises our awareness of tramadol induced seizures .
