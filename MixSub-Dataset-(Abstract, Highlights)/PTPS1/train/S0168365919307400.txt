 Recently cyclodextrin has shown the potential for effective treatment of atherosclerotic plaques in mice by solubilizing plaque cholesterol . While promising as a new therapy for atherosclerosis poor pharmacokinetics and ototoxicity of CD pose a therapeutic challenge . Thus far however there has been no attempts to overcome such limitations . Here we showed that cyclodextrin polymer with a diameter of 10nm exhibits outstanding pharmacokinetics and plaque targeting efficacy compared to a monomeric CD . Furthermore we found out that CDP does not induce plasma membrane disruption as opposed to CD which eliminated cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity of CD . In a mouse model of atherosclerosis subcutaneous injections of beta cyclodextrin polymer significantly inhibited plaque growth compared to monomeric hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin at the same dose . More importantly CDP did not induce significant ototoxicity at a high dose where HPCD reduced the outer hair cell content by 36 . These findings suggest that the polymerization of CD can overcome major limitations of CD therapy for treatment of atherosclerosis .
