 Indiscriminate overuse or occupational exposure to agricultural chemicals can lead to neurotoxicity . Many pesticides act to impair mitochondrial function which can lead to exacerbation of neurodegeneration . Triazole fungicides are applied to grain fruit and vegetable crops to combat mold and fungi and their use is increasing worldwide . Here we assessed the

@highlight Triazole fungicides propiconazole and tebuconazole affect mitochondrial membrane potential in SHSY 5Y cells.
@highlight Propiconazole affects mitochondrial bioenergetics by decreasing basal respiration.
@highlight Some ceramides and fatty acids are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity.
@highlight Propiconazole is more neurotoxic to SH SY5Y cells than tebuconazole based on the endpoints measured.
@highlight This study provides insight into pesticide toxicity and Parkinsons disease using lipidomics.
