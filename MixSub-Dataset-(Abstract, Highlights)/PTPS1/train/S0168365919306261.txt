 Oral mucosal drug delivery systems have been developed to expedite the regeneration of oral mucosa there are still many challenges related to residence time for drugs because the ceaseless changes of saliva mouth movement and involuntary swallowing prevent robust adhesion of drugs and or drug loaded biomaterials . Thus it is highly desirable to develop the delivery platforms exhibiting robust stable adhesion within oral cavities . Herein we have developed an adhesive polysaccharide oral patch called Chitoral that utilizes chemical principles shown in wet resistant mussel adhesion . Chitoral plays an important role as an adhesive layer in wet environments . We unexpectedly found that Chitoral instantly dissolves upon contact with saliva and a labial mucous layer and then the dissolved Chitoral compounds forms an insoluble adhesion layer with mucins at Chitoral mucous interface nearly immediate actions . Later Chitoral gradually converts into adhesive hydrogels by the cooperative actions of covalent crosslinking and physical entanglement . The instant robust muco adhesion properties of Chitoral provides long lasting therapeutic effects of drugs resulting enhanced healing of oral ulcer . Thus mussel inspired mucous resistant adhesive platforms Chitoral can be a platform for oral mucosal drug delivery systems .
