 Cell cycle dysregulation is the mainstay of aberrant cell proliferation which leads to tumor progression . Mutations in tumor cells initiate various dysregulated pathways and spontaneous over proliferation with genomic chromosomal instability . Despite advances in cancer therapy it has remained a medicinal challenge to treat . Besides the complexity of pathophysiological pathways behind cancer raises the need for novel multi target agents possessing fewer side effects . Alkaloid based therapies have been explored so far to target cell division in cancer including vinca alkaloids . As a class of hopeful carboline derivatives growing evidence has indicated their auspicious roles in combating cancer by inhibiting topoisomerase kinesin Eg5 telomerase cyclin dependent kinase IB kinase and polo like kinase 1 in the transition phases of cell cycle . In this review
