 There is an ongoing need for noninvasive tools to manipulate brain activity with molecular spatial and temporal specificity . Here we have investigated the use of MRI visible albumin based nanoclusters for noninvasive localized and temporally specific drug delivery to the rat brain . We demonstrated that IV injected nanoclusters could be deposited into target brain regions

@highlight 100 200nm MRI visible albumin based nanoclusters are used
@highlight as a carrier of neuroactive agents.
@highlight Nanoclusters are deposited into the rat hippocampus using image guided FUS BBB opening.
@highlight Nanoclusters location is confirmed with MRI.
@highlight A second FUS treatment triggered the release of nanocluster load
@highlight FUS triggered release of glutamate from nanoclusters caused an increase in neuronal activation.
