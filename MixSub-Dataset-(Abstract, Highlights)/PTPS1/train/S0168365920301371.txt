 Myocardial infarction causes serious loss of cardiac muscle and dysfunction . To restore MI exogenous stem cells should be efficiently delivered . However due to severe physical and physiological cardiac environment recent strategies have faced challenges including low cell persistence low integration and delayed therapeutic effects . Herein we proposed mesenchymal stem cell therapeutic platform using adhesive protein based immiscible condensed liquid system derived from bioengineered mussel adhesive protein . With high encapsulation efficiency and survival rate of encapsulated MSCs APICLS was successfully grafted by intramyocardial injection and distributed throughout the scarred myocardium . Its underwater adhesiveness and biocompatibility fostered integration with damaged tissue resulting in high cell persistence and maximized paracrine effects . Bioactive molecules released from APICLS with MSCs induced angiogenesis and cardioprotection delayed cardiac remodeling reduced fibrosis and recovered contractive force . Thus our proposed strategy represents an innovative approach for recovering infarcted cardiac tissues with damaged structural and contractive function .

@highlight Fluid immiscible sticky platform helps prolonged cell retention in harsh condition.
@highlight Surviving cells regenerate infarcted myocardium with maximized paracrine effect.
@highlight This study suggests a promising assessment for direct stem cell injection strategy.
