 The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A is one of the most common immunosuppressive agents used in organ transplantation . However its clinical use is often limited by several unwanted effects including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity . By using immunohistochemical and ELISA techniques it was found that CsA administration causes a rapid activation of a disintegrin and metalloproteases 17 epidermal growth factor receptor and subsequent ERK1 2 phosphorylation in the liver and kidney of albino mice . Furthermore this study presents mechanistic relevance of this signaling cascade involving reactive oxygen species mediated ADAM 17 EGFR ERK1 2 activation as indicated by a clear reduction in ADAM 17 and EGFR activities as well as ERK1 2 phosphorylation when the animals pretreated with Polyethylene glycol superoxide dismutase before CsA administration . Collectively our findings demonstrate that CsA has the ability to activate ADAM 17 mediated EGFR ERK1 2 phosphorylation in the liver and kidney of albino mice in ROS dependent manner . Finally these data may support the concept of using antioxidant therapy as a valuable approach for the prevention of CsA induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity .
