 An original scheme was developed for the synthesis of previously undescribed unsaturated macrodiolides containing a 1Z 5Z diene moiety in 4480 yields and with high stereoselectivity based on the intermolecular esterification of diols with alka nZ Z dienedicarboxylic acids catalyzed by hafnium triflate

@highlight Catalytic synthesis of new 1Z 5Z diene macrodiolides have been developed.
@highlight New molecules are efficient apoptosis inducers in cancer cells.
@highlight Macrodiolides suppress phosphorylation of Akt and p38 kinases and CREB transcription factor.
@highlight The structures of all novel compounds were confirmed by NMR measurements.
