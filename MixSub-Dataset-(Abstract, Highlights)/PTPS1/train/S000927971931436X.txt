 Tebuconazole is a broad spectrum conazole fungicide that has been used in agriculture in the control of foliar and soil borne diseases of many crops . The present study has investigated the adverse effects of subchronic exposure to TEB on the kidney of male rats . Animals were divided into four equal groups and treated with TEB at increasing doses 0.9 9 and 27mg kg body weight for 28 consecutive days . The results showed that TEB induced oxidative stress in the kidney demonstrated by an increase in malondialdehyde protein carbonyl advanced oxidation protein product levels and DNA damage as compared to the controls . Furthermore superoxide dismutase catalase glutathione peroxidase activities were increased in the renal tissue of treated rats . Moreover significant decrease in reduced glutathione content in TEB treated rats was observed while oxidized glutathione levels were increased thus a marked fall in GSH GSSG ratio was registered in the kidney . Glutathione reductase activity showed a significant increase after TEB exposure . Moreover TEB down regulated the expression of Bcl2 and up regulated the expression of Bax and caspase 3 which triggered apoptosis via the Bax Bcl2 and caspase pathway . Also TEB administration resulted in altered biochemical indicators of renal function and varying lesions in the overall histo architecture of renal tissues . Taken together our findings brought into light the renal toxicity induced by TEB which was found to be significant at low doses .
