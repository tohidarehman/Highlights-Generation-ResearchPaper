 The inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme by Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs exposes the gastrointestinal mucosa to peptic injuries . Selective inhibition of COX 2 generates surpassing anti inflammatory drug candidates with reduced side effects over current NSAIDs . Phytosterols consumption is reported to decrease the risk of cardiovascular problems . Reports on the selective inhibition of COX 2 by phytosterols are scarce . The present study assesses the anti inflammatory potentials of phytosterols from

@highlight The toxicity associated with NSAIDs is as a result of selective inhibition of COX 1.
@highlight Selective inhibition of COX 2 generates surpassing anti inflammatory drug candidates.
@highlight Phytosterols consumption reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
@highlight Phytosterols are selective inhibitors of COX 2.
