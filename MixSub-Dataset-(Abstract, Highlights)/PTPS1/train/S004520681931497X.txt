 Here we present a novel G4 binding family of compounds based on a central core of phenyl ditriazole modified with carbohydrates and phenyl pyrrolidinyl side chains . Their synthesis was achieved using controlled click chemistry conditions to obtain both symmetric and dissymmetric carb PDTZ derivatives without any intermediate protecting steps through an optimized methodology . Binding of the new carb PDTZ to a variety of G quadruplex motifs was examined using different biophysical techniques . The symmetric carb PDTZ derivatives were not able to stabilize G4 but the dissymmetric ones did . Interestingly the dissymmetric carb PDTZ derivatives showed much higher G4 vs duplex DNA selectivity than the control compound PDTZ
