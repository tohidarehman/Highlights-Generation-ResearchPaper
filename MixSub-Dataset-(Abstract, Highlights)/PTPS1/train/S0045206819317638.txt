 Heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atom play a key role in the normal life cycle of a cell . Pyrazolopyrimidine is a privileged class of nitrogen containing fused heterocyclic compound contributing to a major portion of all lead molecules in medicinal chemistry . The thumbprint of pyrazolopyrimidine as a pharmacophore is always noticeable due to its analogy with the adenine base in DNA . Pyrazolopyrimidines are divided into five types based on the mechanism of action on the specific target conferring a wide scope of research which has accelerated the interest of researchers to investigate its biological profile . In 1956 the anti cancer activity of pyrazolopyrimidine was evaluated for the first time with appreciable results . Since then medicinal chemists centered their work on various methods of synthesis and evaluating the biological profile of pyrazolopyrimidine isomers . This report consists of novel methodologies followed to synthesize pyrazolopyrimidine isomers along with a note on their biological significance . To the best of our knowledge this review article will be first of its kind to encompass different synthetic procedures along with anti cancer kinase inhibition phosphodiesterase inhibition and receptor blocking activity of pyrazolopyrimidine moieties .
