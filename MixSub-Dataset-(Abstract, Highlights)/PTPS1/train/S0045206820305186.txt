 Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma is a highly aggressive pediatric brainstem tumor which accounts for about 1020 of childhood brain tumors . The survival rate for DIPG remains very poor with a median survival of less than 1year . The dismal prognosis associated with DIPG has been exacerbated by the failure of a large number of clinical trials to meaningfully improve survival compared with radiotherapy the current standard of care for DIPG . In the current study we screened a natural product library and for the first time identified 6 natural compounds displaying inhibitory effects on DIPG proliferation and anchorage independent growth through inducing tumor cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest . Subsequent RNA Sequencing and functional validation revealed the molecular mechanisms of these compounds with anti DIPG activities and identified new cellular factors such as Fibronectin 1 and Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C like required for DIPG survival as potential therapeutic targets . Our study provides promising directions to fight against this deadly pediatric cancer .
