 There is an urging continuous need for novel anti cancer agents due to persistent chemoresistance . Herein newly synthesized cinnolines are evaluated for their possible anticancer activities and suggested mechanisms . In the current study a simple and efficient synthesis of densely functionalized cinnolines has been developed that relied on multi component reaction of ethyl 5 cyano 4 methyl 1 aryl 6 oxo 1 6 dihydropyridazine 3 carboxylates with aromatic aldehydes and nitromethane in dioxane pipridine under controlled microwave heating . Selected cinnolines Induction of mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is a possible mechanism by which cinnoline
