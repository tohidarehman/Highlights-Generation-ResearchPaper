 Thermostability of monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates as a critical property of biotherapeutics is important for their physicochemical processes pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics . Fc glycosylation of mAbs plays a crucial role in antibody functions including thermostability however due to the lack of homogeneous glycosylation for comparison the precise impact of glycoforms on thermostability of mAbs and ADCs remains challenging to elucidate . In this paper we employed the technique of differential scanning fluorimetry to investigate the thermostability of Fc domains glycoengineered mAbs and ADCs carrying well defined N glycan structures for comparison . The results revealed that high mannose type N glycans dramatically reduce the T

@highlight In depth analysis on thermostability of mAbs and ADCs with homogeneous glycoforms by differential scanning fluorimetry DSF .
@highlight Afucosylated mAbs reduce Tm values and unnatural glycoforms compensate the thermostability.
@highlight Glycosite specific ADCs may lead to Tm decrease but optimal linkage structures can improve their thermostability.
@highlight Advance the knowledge on biophysical properties of mAbs based new biotherapeutics and their design strategy.
