 Sphingosine 1 phosphate is now emerging as an important player in cancer inflammation autoimmune neurological and cardiovascular disorders . Abundance evidence in animal and humans cancer models has shown that SphK1 is linked to cancer . Thus there is a great interest in the development new SphK1 inhibitors as a potential new treatment for cancer . In a search for new SphK1 inhibitors we selected the well known SKI II inhibitor as the starting structure and we synthesized a new inhibitor structurally related to SKI II with a significant but moderate inhibitory effect . In a second approach based on our molecular modeling results we designed new structures based on the structure of PF 543 the most potent known SphK1 inhibitor . Using this approach we report the design synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of compounds with inhibitory activity against both SphK1 and SphK2 . These new inhibitors were obtained incorporating new connecting chains between their polar heads and hydrophobic tails .
