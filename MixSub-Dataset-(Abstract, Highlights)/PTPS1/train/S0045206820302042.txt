 Gemcitabine a cytostatic drug from the pyrimidine antimetabolite group exhibits limited storage stability and numerous side effects during therapy . One of the strategies to improve the effectiveness of therapy with such drugs is the use of supramolecular nano containers including dendrimers and macrocyclic compounds . The ability of gemcitabine to attach a proton in an aqueous environment necessitates the search for a carrier that is well tolerated by an organism and capable of supramolecular binding of a ligand in a cationic form . In the current study a promising strategy was tested for using cucurbituril Q7 to bind gemcitabine cations for its efficient intracellular delivery on three selected cancer cell lines . Based on physicochemical studies equilibrium dialysis UV and
