 Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious respiratory disease with limited therapeutic options . Since TGF is a critical factor in the fibrotic process downregulation of this cytokine has been considered a potential approach for disease treatment . Herein we designed a new lung targeted delivery technology based on the complexation of polymeric antisense oligonucleotides and dimeric human defensin 23 . Antisense oligonucleotides targeting TGF mRNA were polymerized by rolling circle amplification and complexed with DhBD23 . After complexation with DhBD23 pASO showed improved serum stability and enhanced uptake by fibroblasts

@highlight We developed the pASO DhBD23 complex as a lung targeted gene delivery platform.
@highlight The pASO DhBD23 complex targeting TGF mRNA could alleviate lung fibrosis in mice.
@highlight The pASO DhBD23 complex is a promising platform for lung targeted gene therapy.
