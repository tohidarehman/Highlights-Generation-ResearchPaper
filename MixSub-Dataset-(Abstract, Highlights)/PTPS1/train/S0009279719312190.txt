 Synthetic amorphous silica nanoparticles are used widely in industrial applications . These nanoparticles are not classified for their carcinogenicity in humans . However some data still demonstrate a potential carcinogenic risk of these compounds in humans . The Bhas 42cell line was developed to screen chemicals as tumor initiators or promoters according to their ability to trigger cell to cell transformation in a cell transformation assay . In the present study we performed unsupervised transcriptomic analysis after exposure of Bhas 42cells to NM 203 SAS as well as to positive Min U Sil 5 crystalline silica microparticles and 12

@highlight Synthetic amorphous silica nanomaterials induce transformation of Bhas 42cells.
@highlight Early modulated signaling pathways are linked to cell adhesion and proliferation.
@highlight Twelve genes were selected based on their potential role in cell transformation.
@highlight These genes may serve as early markers of Bhas 42cell transformation induced by SAS.
