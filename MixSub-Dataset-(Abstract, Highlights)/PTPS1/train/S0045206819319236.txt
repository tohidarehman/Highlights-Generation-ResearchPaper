 A novel synthetic approach was developed for the synthesis of 3 hydrazinotriazolothiadiazines in just one step from Purpald and phenacyl bromides . They were then selectively tethered to naphthoquinone fragments through hydrazine moiety generating novel Naphthoquinone hydrazinotriazolothiadiazine analogues .

@highlight Novel strategy was adopted to synthesize Naphthoquinone hydrazinotriazolothiadiazines.
@highlight Synthesized analogs are cytotoxic against HepG2 MCF 7 cells in M concentration.
@highlight Compound
@highlight induced caspase 3 cell cycle arrest at Pre G1 apoptotic G2 M phases.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight exhibited potential inhibition of Topoisomerase II B.
