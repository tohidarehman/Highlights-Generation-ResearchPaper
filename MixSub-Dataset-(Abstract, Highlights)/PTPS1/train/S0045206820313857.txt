 Alkaline phosphatases are a class of homodimeric enzymes which physiologically possess the dephosphorylation ability . APs catalyzes the hydrolysis of monoesters into phosphoric acid which in turn catalyze a transphosphorylation reaction . Thiazoles are nitrogen and sulfur containing aromatic heterocycles considered as effective APs inhibitors . In this context the current research paper presents the successful synthesis spectroscopic characterization and
