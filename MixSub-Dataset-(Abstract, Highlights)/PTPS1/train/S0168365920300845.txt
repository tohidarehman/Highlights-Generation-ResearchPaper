 Tumor resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is an inexorable clinical event . The manipulation of adaptive changes in cancer cells while inhibiting the signaling pathways could be an effective strategy for overcoming TKI resistance toward reducing tumor relapse and prolonging survival . Here we tested this approach by using polymeric nanomedicines delivering the pan kinase inhibitor staurosporine to treat renal cell carcinoma resistant to the multi targeted TKI sunitinib . STS blocked the activity of TKI resistant protein kinases and strongly inhibited adaptive dynamics in RCC cells promoted by MDR1 and GLUT1 to overcome sunitinib resistance . Co delivery of STS and epirubicin directed to eliminate fast proliferating cancer cells through the same nanomedicine platform enabled safe and potent
