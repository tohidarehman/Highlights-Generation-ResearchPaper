 Human butyrylcholinesterase is a stoichiometric bioscavenger that protects from the toxicity of nerve agents . Non human primates are suitable models for toxicity studies that can not be performed in humans . We evaluated the biochemical properties of native macaque tetramers compared to recombinant MaBChE monomers PEGylated recombinant MaBChE tetramers and monomers and native HuBChE tetramers .

@highlight Macaque and human butyrylcholinesterase have similar catalytic properties.
@highlight Biochemical properties of monomeric and tetrameric BChE forms are identical.
@highlight 2 PAM reactivates DFP inhibited HuBChE 300 fold faster than DFP Macaque BChE.
@highlight Proline 285 in HuBChE has a major role in fast reactivation by 2 PAM.
