 Alzheimers disease is a neurodegenerative process that compromises cognitive functions . The physiopathology of AD is multifactorial and is mainly supported by the cholinergic and amyloid hypotheses which allows the identification the fundamental role of some markers such as the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and secretase and the amyloid peptide . In this work we prepared a series of chalcones and 2 aminochalcones which were tested against AChE and BACE 1 enzymes and on the aggregation of A . All compounds inhibited AChE activity with different potencies . We have found that the majority of chalcones having the amino group are able to inhibit BACE 1 which was not observed for chalcones without this group . The most active compound is the one derived from 2 3 dichlorobenzaldeyde having an IC

@highlight Twelve 2 aminochalcones and a glycinate based derivative were synthesized.
@highlight Compound
@highlight reduces in 52 the A
@highlight fibrils formation in addition to inhibiting BACE 1 and AChE.
@highlight The glycinate derivative of chalcone
@highlight retains the biological activity.
@highlight Compound
@highlight has a remarkable inhibitory effect on AChE 0.08m and BACE 1 2.71m 
@highlight Chalcones without amino group fail to inhibit BACE 1.
