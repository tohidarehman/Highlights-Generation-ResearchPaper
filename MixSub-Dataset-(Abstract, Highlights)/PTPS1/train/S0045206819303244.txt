 Recently targeting survivin proved to be an attractive strategy for developing anticancer agents . Survivin overexpression is highly correlated with cancer aggressiveness recurrence and resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment and radiotherapy . Additionally survivin is overexpressed selectively in most cancer types with a very little expression in completely differentiated cells which encouraged us to design and synthesize a novel series of 3 cyanopyridine derivatives targeting survivin . The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against three cancer cell lines PC 3 HepG2 and MDA MB 231 . Compounds

@highlight A series of new 3 cyanopyridine derivatives were designed and synthesized.
