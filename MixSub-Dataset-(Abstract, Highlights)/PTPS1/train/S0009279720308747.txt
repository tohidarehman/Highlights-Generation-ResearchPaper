 Ellagic acid is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound that has been shown to exhibit diverse beneficial pharmacological activities including anti osteoclastogenesis effect . However the molecular mechanism by which EA inhibits osteoclastogenesis remains to be elucidated . The protein protein interaction between receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand and its receptor RANK contributes to osteoclast differentiation and activation in bone remodeling and is regarded as an important therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoporosis . The current study is focused on investigating whether EA can directly bind to RANKL and or RANK and block the interaction between RANKL and RANK thereby inhibiting downstream signaling pathways . Interestingly we found that EA had strong affinities to RANK and RANKL with the estimated equilibrium dissociation constants

@highlight Ellagic acid EA inhibited RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation and F actin ring formation.
@highlight EA directly bound to RANK and RANKL with strong affinities and blocked RANKLRANK interaction.
@highlight EA suppressed canonical RANK signaling pathways in osteoclast precursors.
@highlight EA downregulated master transcriptional factors and osteoclast specific genes and proteins expression.
