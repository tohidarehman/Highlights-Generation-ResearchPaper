 Sodium selenite directed crosslinked hydrogels based on hyaluronic acid dopamine including indocyanine green were developed for local therapy of breast cancer . Se can induce polymerization of dopamine by making alkaline pH value coordinate with the functional groups of HD and kill cancer cells by pro oxidant effects . ICG can be entrapped in the crosslinked HD Se hydrogel network and long lasting photothermal efficacies can be maintained for cancer therapy . HD conjugate was synthesized

@highlight Sodium selenite directed crosslinked hyaluronic acid hydrogels were fabricated.
@highlight Sodium selenite contributed to the crosslinking of gel and chemotherapeutic effects.
@highlight Indocyanine green included in the hydrogel exhibited photothermal therapeutic effects.
@highlight Designed hydrogels can be applied to the local chemo photothermal therapy of cancer.
