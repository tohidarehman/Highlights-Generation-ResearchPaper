 Stilbene based compounds are largely described for their antioxidant activity . But their use as anticancer chemotherapeutics is hampered by poor pharmacokinetic properties and non selectivity towards cancer and non cancer potency . To overcome these drawbacks twin chain cationic lipid conjugated methoxy enriched stilbene derivatives were designed synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer potency . Our findings reveal that

@highlight Developed a series of cationic amphiphilic molecules based on stilbene.
@highlight Nine methoxy enriched substituted stilbenes with varying hydrophobic twin chains have been synthesized.
@highlight All compounds tested in both cancer and non cancer cell lines for their anticancer potency and selectivity.
@highlight Compound with hexa methoxy and C16 lipid was the most potent and selective anticancer agent.
@highlight induced ROS generation apoptosis autophagy and cell cycle arrest.
@highlight has self aggregation property and entraps drugs thus behaves as drug delivery agent.
