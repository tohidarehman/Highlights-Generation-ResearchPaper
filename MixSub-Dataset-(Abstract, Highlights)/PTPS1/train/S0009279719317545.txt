 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common lethal tumors with a high recurrence rate and low survival rate . Therefore an urgent need exists for novel and effective treatment strategies for HNSCC patients . Osthole a natural ingredient extracted from Our findings show that the anti proliferation effect of osthole might function through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HNSCC . Osthole could also down regulating the protein level of cell cycle and apoptosis related proteins such as Bcl 2 PARP1 Survivin CyclinB1 and Cdc2 while up regulating expression of Cleaved Caspase3 9 Cleaved PARP1 and Bax . Similarly osthole suppressed the in vivo growth of FaDu cells in a subcutaneous tumor model . In terms of mechanism our data show that osthole can suppress the PI3K AKT pathway . In the current study our in vitro and in vivo assay showed the suppressive effect of Osthole on HNSCC cells through induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . Moreover the action mechanisms of Osthole on proliferation related signaling pathways was disclosed . Our present study suggests that osthole might be used as an effective therapeutic agent for patients with HNSCC .
