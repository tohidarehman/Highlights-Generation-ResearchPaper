 mTOR inhibitors are considered today to be one of the most promising anticancer drugs . Here to study the mechanism of the acquired resistance of MCF 7 breast cancer cells to mTOR inhibitors two different models of the cell resistance were used rapamycin resistant MCF 7 Rap subline developed under long term rapamycin treatment and metformin resistant MCF 7 M subline obtained by long term metformin treatment . We have found that both resistant sublines were characterized by common features increased expression of mTOR interacting Raptor protein increased phosphorylation of Akt and activation of growth related transcriptional factor AP 1 . Cell response to mTOR inhibitors was partially restored under treatment with PI3K inhibitor wortmannin supporting the direct connection between Akt activation and poor cell response to therapeutic drugs .

@highlight Novel cell sublines with resistance to mTOR inhibitors were developed.
@highlight Activation of mTOR interacting Raptor protein Akt and AP 1 factor are associated with resistance.
@highlight Wortmannin restores cell sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.
@highlight mir 181c is involved in the cell resistance to mTOR inhibitors.
