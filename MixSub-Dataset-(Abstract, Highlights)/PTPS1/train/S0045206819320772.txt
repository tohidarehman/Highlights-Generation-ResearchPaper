 Steroid sulfatase is a sulfatase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of sulfated steroid precursors to free steroid . The inhibition of STS could abate estrogenic steroids that stimulate the proliferation and development of breast cancer and therefore STS is a potential target for adjuvant endocrine therapy . In this study a series of 3 benzylaminocoumarin 7

@highlight Nineteen 3 aminocoumarin 7 
@highlight  sulfamates were designed and synthesized.
@highlight SAR revealed that modification at 3 position of coumarin resulted in enhancing STS inhibition.
@highlight Substitution at benzyl of 3 benzyl aminocoumarin 7 
@highlight  sulfamates was crucial for STS inhibition.
@highlight Compound
@highlight inhibited STS from human placenta IC
@highlight 130nM and MCF 7 IC
@highlight 1.35M .
