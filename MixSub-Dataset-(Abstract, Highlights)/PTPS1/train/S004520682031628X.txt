 Targeting VEGFR 2 signaling pathway is well established as an important approach for the treatment of solid tumors particularly renal cancer . Herein novel indolyl 1 2 4 triazole hybrids were designed and synthesized as VEGFR 2 kinase inhibitors with potential anti renal cancer activity . The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed based on their spectral and elemental analyses . The results of

@highlight Novel indolyl 1 2 4 triazole hybrids were designed and synthesized.
