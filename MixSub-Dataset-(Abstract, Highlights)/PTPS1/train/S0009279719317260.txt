 Heart rhythm disturbances have been widely recognized as major triggers of cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease patients . Connexin 43 composed gap junctions are essential in cardiomyocyte synchronization and may be involved in the pathological response to uremic toxins . Indoxyl sulfate is one of the most dominant uremic toxins that contribute to CKD related cardiovascular diseases . In primary cultures of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes we demonstrated that IS treatment decreased spontaneous contraction without impairing viability . In addition there was disruption of gap junction intercellular communication between cardiomyocytes after 30min of IS stimulation . IS caused time and dose dependent Cx43 redistribution and the patterns of Cx43 immunostaining returned to baseline while IS stimulation was removed . Furthermore IS exposure downregulated Cx43 protein and mRNA levels . Elevated JNK1 and JNK2 phosphorylation was further identified after IS exposure in both rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells . The above changes as well as GJIC and Cx43 suppression were reversed by pretreatment with a JNK inhibitor . Inhibition of p JNK attenuated IS mediated downward trends in Cx43 transcription and translation . In cardiac muscle from nephrectomy induced CKD mice an alteration in Cx43 level was identified at intercalated discs . Our findings disclosed that JNK activation might participate in the remodeling of gap junction and Cx43 expression by uremic toxin IS both in vitro and

@highlight IS restrained spontaneous contraction in cardiomyocytes with gap junction disruption.
@highlight Cx43 protein and mRNA level were reduced under IS exposure with time and dose dependent effect.
@highlight The inhibition of JNK ameliorated IS induced Cx43 composed gap junction reassembly in cardiomyocytes.
