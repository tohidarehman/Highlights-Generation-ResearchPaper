 Artesunate is a kind of derivative of artemisinin which possesses potent anti cancer effect in addition to its anti malarial property . And autophagy was a highly conserved process exerting a double edged effect in cancer cell survival . Besides apoptosis is a programmed cell death program crucial to cell homeostasis . However the relations between autophagy and apoptosis and the role of artesunate in this interaction have not been elucidated in bladder cancer . In present study we used human bladder cancer cells to investigate that how artesunate would influence autophagy and apoptosis processes . We found that artesunate could inhibit the viability proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells as well as induce autophagy in a time and dose dependent manner in addition the artesunate induced autophagy subsequently activated cells apoptosis . Furthermore we pretreated T24 and EJ cells with 3 Methyladenine or Rapamycin to inhibit or promote autophagy respectively leading to inhibited or increased apoptosis . Moreover pretreatment of these cell lines with Acadesine or Dorsomorphin to activate or inhibit the AMPK mTOR ULK1 pathway respectively also resulting in promotion or suppression in both autophagy and apoptosis . In the upstream ROS upregulation triggered by ART initiated AMPK mTOR ULK1 axis . However this initiative effect of ROS can be reversed by N Acetyl
