 Thermosensitive poloxamer 407 hydrogels were evaluated as slow release system for optimizing CTLA 4 therapy . Slow release reduces systemic antibody levels and potentially mitigates the side effects of CTLA 4 therapy . The 25 P407 hydrogel is injectable at room temperature and depots are established quickly after subcutaneous injection . Scanning electron microscopy revealed the porous structure of the hydrogel average pore surface was 1335m

@highlight CTLA 4 therapy often induces systemic side effects.
@highlight Slow release systems are promising to optimize CTLA 4 therapy.
@highlight Injectable hydrogels were tested for slow release of anti CTLA 4 antibody.
@highlight Hydrogels were biocompatible and reduced systemic antibody levels.
@highlight Hydrogel based CTLA 4 therapy effectively inhibited tumor growth.
