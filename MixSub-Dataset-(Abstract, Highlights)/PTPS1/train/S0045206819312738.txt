 TB continues to be a leading health threat despite the availability of powerful anti TB drugs . We report herein the design and synthesis of various hybrid molecules comprising pyrazine scaffold and various formerly identified anti mycobacterial moieties . Thirty one compounds were screened

@highlight New series of pyrazines were designed and synthesized as potential anti TB agents.
@highlight Six compounds displayed potent activity with MIC values 6.25g ml.
@highlight The most active compounds showed reasonable safety margins with SI 200.
@highlight 3 step target fishing study postulated pantothenate synthetase as possible target.
@highlight Docking studies on the enzyme highlighted favorable interaction patterns.
@highlight Physicochemical ADME and drug like properties were found to be adequate.
