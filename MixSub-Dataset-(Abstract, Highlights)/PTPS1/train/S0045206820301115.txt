 In treating wounds long lasting infection is considered the major impediment . Drugs are rendered ineffective by pathogenic microorganisms via antibiotic resistance and calls for designing and development of new drugs . Herein we report synthesis of eight different

@highlight This study involves the antibacterial antibiofilm and wound healing potentials screening of synthetic hydrazine based cationic salts.
@highlight Some of the synthesized organic salts showed good antibacterial antibiofilm and wound healing activities.
@highlight Compounds QAS 2 7 and 8 can be used for further mechanistic studies to be employed as antibacterial antibiofilm and wound healing agents.
