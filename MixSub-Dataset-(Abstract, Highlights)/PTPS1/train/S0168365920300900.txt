 Despite the promising anticancer effects of kinesin spindle protein inhibition functional plasticity of kinesins induced resistance against KSP inhibitors in a variety of cancers leading to clinical failure . Additionally paclitaxel is a widely used anticancer agent but drug resistance has limited its use in the recurrent cancers . To overcome resistance against KSP inhibitors we paired KSP inhibition with microtubule stabilization using KSP siRNA and paclitaxel . To enable temporal co localization of both drugs in tumor cells

@highlight We prepared KSP siRNA paclitaxel loaded liposomes and paired KSP inhibition with microtubule stabilization.
@highlight Paclitaxel prevented a different kinesin Kif15 from replacing all essential functions of KSP when KSP was inhibited.
@highlight Our combination therapy shows more effective antiproliferative activity than either paclitaxel or KSP siRNA alone.
@highlight This work provides a potential anticancer strategy to overcome resistance against KSP inhibitors.
