 Aptamers are a class of folded nucleic acid strands capable of binding to different target molecules with high affinity and selectivity . Over the years they have gained a substantial amount of interest as promising molecular tools for numerous medical applications particularly in targeted therapeutics . However only the different treatment approaches and current developments of aptamer drug therapies have been discussed so far ignoring the crucial technical and functional aspects of constructing a therapeutically effective aptamer driven drug delivery system that translates to improved
