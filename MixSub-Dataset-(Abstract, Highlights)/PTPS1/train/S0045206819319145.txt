 Natural products have shown promise for epigenetic modulations and thus are therapeutically potential for cancer prevention and treatment . In this work we report the identification of natural product Biochanin A as a new LSD1 inhibitor and further biological evaluation in gastric MGC 803 cells . Biochanin A effectively and reversibly inhibited LSD1 IC

@highlight Biochanin A effectively inhibited LSD1 IC
@highlight  2.95M and showed selective inhibition to LSD1 over MAO A B.
@highlight Biochanin A inhibited growth of MGC 803 cells IC
@highlight  6.77M but was less toxic to normal GES 1 IC
@highlight  32M .
@highlight Biochanin A could suppress colony formation cell apoptosis and migration of MGC 803 cells.
