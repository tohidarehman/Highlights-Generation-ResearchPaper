 The novel human coronavirus 2 called SARS CoV 2 is the causative agent of Coronavirus Induced Disease and has spread causing a global pandemic . Currently there is no vaccine to prevent infection nor any approved drug for the treatment . The development of a new drug is time consuming and can not be relied on as a solution in combatting the immediate global challenge . In such a situation the drug repurposing becomes an attractive solution to identify the potential of COVID 19 treatment by existing drugs which are approved for other indications . Here we review the potential use of rapamycin an mTOR inhibitor that can be repurposed at low dosages for the treatment of COVID 19 . Rapamycin inhibits protein synthesis delays aging reduces obesity in animal models and inhibits activities or expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as IL 2 IL 6 and IL 10 . Overall the use of rapamycin can help to control viral particle synthesis cytokine storms and contributes to fight the disease by its anti aging and anti obesity effects . Since rapamycin targets the host factors and not viral machinery it represents a potent candidate for the treatment of COVID 19 than antiviral drugs as its efficacy is less likely to be dampened with high mutation rate of viral RNA . Additionally the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell proliferation may aid in reducing viral replication . Therefore by drug repurposing low dosages of rapamycin can be tested for the potential treatment of COVID 19 SARS CoV 2 infection .
