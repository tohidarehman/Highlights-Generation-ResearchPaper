 Geraniol like other plant derived natural bioactive compounds has been found to possess antiproliferative properties that are essential to cope with malignant tumors . However the mechanisms of molecular action of GOH are not fully elucidated . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GOH on some oxidative parameters in human tumor cell lines . Cytotoxicity evaluated in cell lines by the MTT assay genotoxicity by the comet assay and lipid peroxidation by the TBARS . The activities of antioxidant the enzymes superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione S transferase were also analyzed . Additionally intracellular reactive oxygen species nitric oxide and lactate production were determined in HepG2 cells . Both tumor cell lines showed a clear concentration dependent response to GOH in several of the parameters evaluated . Lipids turned out to be more sensitive than DNA to oxidative damage induced by GOH . TBARS levels increased with respect to control

@highlight GOH effects on some oxidative parameters in HepG2 and A549 were studied.
@highlight Lipids were damage but not DNA in both tumor cells.
@highlight SOD and CAT were more sensitive in HepG2 than in A549 while GST was not affected.
@highlight ROS and lactate increased but not nitric oxide in HepG2.
@highlight Oxidative stress could mediate the anti proliferative effects of GOH in tumor cells.
