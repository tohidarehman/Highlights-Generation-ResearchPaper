 2 3 7 8 Tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin accumulates in human body probably influencing adipocyte differentiation and causing various toxic effects including wasting syndrome . Recently orientin a phenolic compound abundant in natural health products has been shown to have antioxidant properties . We investigated the protective effects of orientin against TCDD induced adipocyte dysfunction and its underlying mechanisms . In this study orientin suppressed TCDD induced loss of lipid accumulation . Orientin inhibited TCDD driven decreases in the levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor and adiponectin . Orientin also reduced TCDD induced prostaglandin E
