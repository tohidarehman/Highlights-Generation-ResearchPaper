 Amorphous solid dispersion is a well established approach to improve the dissolution rate of the drugs with low water solubility . However the application of the ASD was hindered by the low drug content and high risk of re crystallization of drugs . The purpose of this research was to develop an ASD film with high content of amorphous olanzapine for oral delivery . To overcome the high crystallization tendency of OLN in polyvinyl alcohol films three dicarboxylic acids fumaric acid and malic acid were introduced in the drug in polymer system as linkers between the drug and the polymer . The influence of the linkers on the re crystallization of OLN in PVA films was evaluated by polarized light microscopy and x ray diffraction . Then the possible mechanisms of crystallization inhibition were discussed based on the results of dielectric spectroscopy differential scanning calorimetry attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared Raman spectroscopy and molecular modeling . Finally the effect of the linkers on the

@highlight Dicarboxylic acids decreased the re crystallization potential of OLN in PVA films.
@highlight Dicarboxylic acids improved the content of amorphous drug in the drug in polymer system.
@highlight Molecular mobility electrical conductivity and hydrogen bonding interactions were the potential indicators for the stability of ASD.
