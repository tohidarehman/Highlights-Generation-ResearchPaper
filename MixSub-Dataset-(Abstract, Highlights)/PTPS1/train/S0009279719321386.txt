 Triple negative breast cancer is the most aggressive form of breast cancer with limited intervention options . Moreover a number of belligerent therapeutic strategies adopted to treat such aggressive forms of cancer have demonstrated detrimental side effects . This necessitates exploration of targeted chemotherapeutics . We assessed the efficacy of a novel indenone derivative N 2 3 dihydro 1

@highlight A novel indenone derivative nID demonstrated anticancer potential in triple negative breast cancer TNBC cells.
@highlight The nID caused G1 arrest in breast cancer MDA MB 231 cells.
@highlight It modulated the p53 NF B survivin axis to upregulate p21
@highlight in MDA MB 231.
@highlight The nID induced p53 dependent senescence in TNBC MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 not in WRL 68 epithelial like cells.
