 Bone defects caused by cancer surgery or trauma have a strong negative impact on human health . Treatment with cell and material based complexes provides an alternative strategy for the regeneration of damaged bone tissue . The good physical properties and suitable biodegradability of a thermosensitive hydrogel has been shown to act as a valuable scaffold . Platelet derived growth factor BB is mainly secreted by platelets and promotes the migration and angiogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells . Although PDGFBB is known to indirectly enhance bone repair

@highlight PDGFBB promoted SCAP cells proliferation.
@highlight PDGFBB stimulated the expression of osteogenic and angiogenic genes in SCAPs.
@highlight Thermosensitive hydrogel was suitable for cell 3D culture.
@highlight Cell and material based complex was found to be a promising therapeutic strategy for bone regeneration.
