 To search for effective and selective COX 2 inhibitors four novel series of tetrazole derivatives were designed based on bioisosteric replacement of SO

@highlight Novel tetrazole derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Bioisosteric replacement of SO
@highlight NH
@highlight in celecoxib with tetrazole ring was adopted.
@highlight Target compounds were screened for COXs inhibition and were more selective towards COX 2.
@highlight The most active six compounds were evaluated for their
@highlight anti inflammatory activity and serum levels of PGE
@highlight  TNF and IL 6.
@highlight Dimethoxy and trimethoxy derivatives displayed potent inhibition of COX 2 PGE
@highlight  TNF and IL 6.
