 Metronomic cancer chemotherapy has displayed the potential to ameliorate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and facilitate antitumor immunotherapy but this strategy requires uninterrupted administration of low dose chemotherapeutic agents and suffers from rapid drug clearance . Here we developed a single dose

@highlight Metronomic cancer chemotherapy may ameliorate immunosuppressive TME.
@highlight PTT combined with metronomic chemotherapy facilitate antitumor immunotherapy.
@highlight Single dose
@highlight immune stimulator storage can achieve the combinatorial strategy.
@highlight This system displays the potential for intensified cancer immunotherapy.
