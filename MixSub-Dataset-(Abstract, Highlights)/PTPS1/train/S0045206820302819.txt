 The design and synthesis of novel multi substituted benzo indole pyrazole Schiff base derivatives of potent DNA gyrase inhibitory activity were the main aims of this study . All the novel synthesized compounds were examined for their antibacterial activities against

@highlight 48 benzo indole pyrazole Schiff base derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Compound
@highlight can act as the most potent DNA gyrase inhibitor in this work.
@highlight Modifications on the benzene and pyrazole rings are the keys to potent activity.
