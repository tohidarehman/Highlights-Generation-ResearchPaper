 A new class of inhibitors of tubulin polymerization based on the 2 alkoxycarbonyl 3 indole molecular skeleton was synthesized and evaluated for antiproliferative activity inhibition of tubulin polymerization and cell cycle effects . The results presented show that the methoxy substitution and location on the indole nucleus plays an important role in inhibition of cell growth and the most favorable position for the substituent was at C 6 . In addition a small size ester function at the 2 position of the indole core was desirable . Also analogues that were alkylated with methyl ethyl or

@highlight Small molecules based on the indole nucleus are inhibitors of tubulin assembly.
@highlight Most of these compounds exhibited broad spectrum antiproliferative activity.
@highlight The most potent compounds induced G2 M arrest and apoptosis.
@highlight A good correlation was observed between antiproliferative and antitubulin activities.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight are potent antiproliferative and antitubulin agents.
