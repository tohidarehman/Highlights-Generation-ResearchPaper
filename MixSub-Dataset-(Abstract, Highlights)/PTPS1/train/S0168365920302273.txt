 Supramolecular hydrogels confer control over structural properties in a reversible dynamic and biomimetic fashion . The design of supramolecular hydrogels with an improved structural and functional recapitulation of damaged organs is important for clinical applications . For wound healing management in particular an effective healing process through the modulation of epidermal growth factor delivery using supramolecular polysaccharide hydrogels has yet to be developed . In this study photo responsive supramolecular polysaccharide hydrogels were formed through host guest interactions between azobenzene and cyclodextrin groups conjugated to hyaluronic acid chains . By exploiting the photoisomerization properties of azobenzene under different wavelengths a supramolecular hydrogel featuring a dynamic spatial network crosslink density through the application of a light stimulus was obtained . Under ultra violet light the loosened hydrogel can rapidly release EGF thereby enhancing EGF delivery at the wound site . Based on an
