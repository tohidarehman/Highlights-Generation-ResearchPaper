 This study was aimed to investigate the potential ameliorative effects of omega 3 fatty acids against acrylamide induced neurotoxicity . Thirty two adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups

@highlight Effects of 3 fatty acids on ACR induced neurotoxicity in rats was assessed.
@highlight ACR disrupted animal behaviors proinflammatory cytokines antioxidant status and neurotransmitters.
@highlight ACR induced various neural degenerative changes necrosis and glial cell activation.
@highlight ACR overexpressed apoptotic marker caspase 3 and astroglial GFAP.
@highlight 3 fatty acids supplements partially attenuated ACR neural impacts.
