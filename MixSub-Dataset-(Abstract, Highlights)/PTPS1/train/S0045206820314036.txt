 Parasitic characteristics mutations and resistance of influenza A virus make it difficult for current influenza antiviral drugs to maintain long term effectiveness . Currently to design non adamantane compounds targeting the S31N mutant of M2 proton channel is a promising direction for the development of novel anti influenza drugs . In our previous research a pinanamine based antiviral
