 TNF Receptor Associated Protein 1 is a mitochondrial paralog of Hsp90 related to the promotion of tumorigenesis in various cancers via maintaining mitochondrial integrity reducing the production of reactive oxygen species and reprogramming cellular metabolism . Consequently Hsp90 and TRAP1 have been targeted to develop cancer therapeutics . Herein we report a series of pyrazolo 3 4

@highlight Pyrazolo 3 4 
@highlight  pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized as mitochondria permeable TRAP1 inhibitors.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight are potent TRAP1 inhibitor in the
@highlight and
@highlight assay with good ADME.
@highlight X ray co crystallization studies confirmed both
@highlight and
@highlight interact with the ATP binding pocket in the TRAP1 protein.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight demonstrated excellent anticancer efficiency in various cancer cells with limited toxicity over normal hepatocyte and prostate cells.
@highlight Mouse PC3 xenograft studies showed
@highlight and
@highlight significantly reduced tumor growth.
