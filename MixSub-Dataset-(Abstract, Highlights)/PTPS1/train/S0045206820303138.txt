 is a challenging malignancy mainly due to aggressive regional involvement early systemic dissemination high recurrence rate and subsequent low patient survival . Scientific advances have contributed in particular by identification of molecular targets as well as the definition of the mechanism of action of the drug candidate in the cellular microenvironment . Previously we have reported the identification of the molecular mechanisms by which calixarene reduces the viability and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells . Now we show the biochemical mechanisms by which CLX6 decreases the aggressiveness of Panc 1 cells focusing specifically on receptor tyrosine kinases . The results show that clathrin mediated endocytosis is involved in CLX6 induced AXL receptor tyrosine kinase degradation in Panc 1 cells . This response may be related to the interaction of CLX6 with the tyrosine kinase receptor binding site . As a result RTK is internalized and degraded by endocytosis a condition that negatively impacts events dependent on its signaling . Additionally CLX6 inhibits migration and invasion of Panc 1 cells by downregulating FAK activity and reducing expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 directly related to the metastatic profile of these cells . It is noteworthy that according to the mechanism proposed here CLX6 appears as a candidate to be used in therapeutic protocols of patients that display high expression of AXL and consequently poor diagnosis .
