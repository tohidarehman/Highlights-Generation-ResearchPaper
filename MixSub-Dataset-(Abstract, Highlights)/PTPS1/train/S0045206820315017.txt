 Building on the conclusions of previous inhibition studies with pyridinium benzenesulfonamides from our team and on the X ray crystal structure of the lead compound identified a series of 24 pyridinium derivatives of 3 aminobenzenesulfonamide was synthesized and investigated for carbonic anhydrase inhibition . The new pyridinium sulfonamides were evaluated as inhibitors of four human carbonic anhydrase isoforms namely CA I CA II CA IX and XII . Excellent inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range was observed against CA IX with most of these sulfonamides and against CA XII with some of the new compounds . These sulfonamides were generally potent inhibitors of CA II and CA I too . Docking studies revealed a preference of these compounds to bind the

@highlight CA IX and CA XII are validated targets in hypoxic tumors essential for their growth.
@highlight A new series of 24 pyridiniumbenzenesulfonamides was designed and synthesized.
@highlight Biological testing revealed nanomolar sub nanomolar potency against CA IX and CA XII.
@highlight Docking studies identified the pyridinium moiety to bind mostly the
@highlight 1 active site.
@highlight The new CAIs inhibited the growth of three human carcinomas under hypoxic conditions.
