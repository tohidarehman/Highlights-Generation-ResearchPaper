 The unique conformational properties functionality low toxicity and low cost make calixarene based compounds a valuable candidate against cancer . The aim of the present study is the synthesis of the upper rim and lower rim functionalized

@highlight Calix 4 arene
@highlight  proline derivatives were designed and characterized.
@highlight Cell viability assay were evaluated in the five cell lines PNT1A A549 DLD 1 HEPG2 and PC 3 .
@highlight  Proline derivative 
@highlight  has been shown the highest toxicity against DLD 1 and A549 cells.
@highlight Compound
@highlight leads apoptotic cell death especially the early stage of apoptosis.
@highlight Cell cycle analysis indicated that
@highlight can be further studied as a potential anticancer agent.
