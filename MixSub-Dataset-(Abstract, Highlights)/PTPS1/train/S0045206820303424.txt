 In search for new molecular entities as anti TB agents the benzimidazoquinazoline polyheterocyclic scaffold has been designed adopting the scaffold hopping strategy . Thirty two compounds have been synthesized through an improved tandem decarboxylative nucleophilic addition cyclocondensation reaction of

@highlight Thirty two alkylbenzimidazoquinazolines were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for anti TB H37Rv activity.
@highlight Fourteen compounds displayed with MIC values of 0.78 6.25 g mL and are non toxic 30 inhibition of RAW 264.7 cell lines at 50 g mL .
@highlight Three compounds 6d 6v and 6x were the most active with MIC of 0.78 0.78 and 0.40 g mL respectively.
@highlight Potent compounds MIC of 6.25 g mL were tested against INH resistant TB strain.
@highlight Two compounds 6d and 6v are active against INH resistant TB strain with MIC of 0.78 and 1.56 g mL respectively.
