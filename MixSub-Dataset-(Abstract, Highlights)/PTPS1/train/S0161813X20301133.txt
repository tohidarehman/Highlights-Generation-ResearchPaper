 Increasing occupational and accidental exposure to carbon black nanoparticles raise concerns over their possible effects on the nervous system . However the influences of CBNPs on the neurodevelopment remain unclear . Thus in this study pregnant mice were exposed to different doses of CBNPs by intranasal instillation on gestation days 918 . Our results demonstrated that maternal exposure to CBNPs caused significant changes on maternal behaviors . Pregnancy exposure to CBNPs also delayed the onset of incisor eruption testes descent and vaginal opening in offspring and caused the reduced body weight until adulthood . In the neurobehavioral tests CBNPs exposed offspring exhibited the elevated latency of negative geotaxis and surface right reflex reduced grasping time and increased cliff avoidance . Histopathological changes were present in F1 generation but not in F2 generation . Intriguingly our data revealed that the levels of total m
