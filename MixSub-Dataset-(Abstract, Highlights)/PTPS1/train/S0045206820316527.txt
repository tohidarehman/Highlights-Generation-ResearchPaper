 Three series of nanosized formazan analogues were synthesized from the reaction of dithiazone with various types of haloketones in sodium ethoxide solution . The structure and the crystal size of the new synthesized derivatives were assured based on the spectral analyses XRD and SEM data . The antibacterial and antifungal activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique . The results showed mild to moderate antibacterial activities and moderate to potent antifungal activities . Significant antifungal activities were observed for four derivatives
