 Hydroxychloroquine is frequently used medications for many auto immunity diseases . However HCQ induced retinal toxicity which might result in irreversible retinopathy is one of the most important complications of HCQ . However the molecular mechanism underlying the HCQ retinal toxicity is still not well known . Retinal pigment epithelium in which HCQ is highly enriched due to the tissue specific affinity of HCQ is considered to play important role in HCQ retinopathy . Herein we used a metabolomics approach based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to investigate the metabolic changes in retinal pigment epithelial cells with HCQ exposure at 6h and 24h . ARPE 19cells were treated with HCQ at sub lethal concentration 20 which was determined with MTT assay . Untargeted metabolic profiling revealed 9 and 15 metabolites that were significantly different between control group and HCQ exposure group at 6h and 24h respectively . Enrichment and pathway analysis highlighted ascorbate and aldarate metabolism
