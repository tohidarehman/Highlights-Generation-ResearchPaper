 This study reported the discovery of novel compounds containing five membered ring fused quinoline core structures as anticancer and antimalarial agents . Two libraries containing these core structures neocryptolepines and carbocycle fused quinolines were prepared and evaluated . Compound

@highlight 23 neocryptolepines and 25 carbocycle fused quinolines were synthesized.
@highlight SAR studies against cancer cell lines and
@highlight strains.
@highlight Novel analogs with high activities against 4 cancer cells and 2
@highlight strains.
@highlight High selectivities when tested in normal human kidney cell.
@highlight Potential for future development as medicinal agents against cancer and malaria.
