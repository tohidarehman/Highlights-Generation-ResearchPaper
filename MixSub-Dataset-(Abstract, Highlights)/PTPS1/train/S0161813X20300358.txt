 During pregnancy maternal lead from earlier exposures mobilizes and crosses placental barriers placing the developing fetus at risk for lead exposure and neurodevelopmental deficits . Some neuronal circuits known to be affected in neurodevelopment disorders can be probed with simple physiological behavioral paradigms . One such neural biomarker is Pre Pulse Inhibition an indicator of adequate sensorimotor gating processing . In clinical studies deficits in PPI have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in human subjects . To our knowledge no studies have examined the use of PPI as a biomarker of toxicant effects on the brain in epidemiological studies . We aimed to estimate the causal effect of prenatal lead exposure assessed by maternal cortical bone lead concentrations on PPI in 279 children from Mexico City .

@highlight Lead is a neurotoxicant associated with neurodevelopmental deficits.
@highlight Prepulse inhibition PPI deficits are associated with neurological disorders.
@highlight We estimated the causal effect of prenatal lead exposure on PPI in children.
@highlight Our findings suggest prenatal lead exposure causes PPI deficits in children.
@highlight PPI may be an objective biomarker of neurotoxicant effects on the brain.
