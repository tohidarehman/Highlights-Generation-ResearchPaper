 1 Methylpyrene is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and rodent carcinogen . Its mutagenic activity depends on sequential activation by various CYP and sulfotransferase enzymes . Previously we have observed induction of micronuclei and mitotic arrest by 1 MP in a Chinese hamster derived cell line expressing both human CYP1A2 and SULT1A1 however the mode of chromosome damage and the involvement of mitotic tubulin structures have not been clarified . In this study we used immunofluorescent staining of centromere protein B with the formed micronuclei and that of and tubulin reflecting the structures of mitotic spindle and centrioles respectively in V79 hCYP1A2 hSULT1A1 cells . The results indicated that 1 MP induced micronuclei in V79 hCYP1A2 hSULT1A1 cells from 0.125 to 2M under a 24h 0h regime while in the parental V79 Mz cells micronuclei were induced by 1 MP only at concentrations8M in both cases the micronuclei induced by 1 MP were predominantly CENP B positive . Following 54h of exposure 1 MP induced mitotic spindle non congression and centrosome amplification in V79 hCYP1A2 hSULT1A1 cells and anaphase telophase retardation at concentrations0.125M with concentration dependence while in V79 Mz cells it was inactive up to 8M . This study suggests that in mammalian cells proficient in activating enzymes 1 MP may induce chromosome loss and mitotic disturbance probably by interfering with the mitotic spindle and centrioles .
