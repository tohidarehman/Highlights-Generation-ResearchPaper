 Dura injury can be intractable during neurosurgical operations . Dural sealant is effective for aiding dura repair and diminishing postoperative complications . However a more optimal dural sealant is still clinically required . On the other hand spinal cord injury is a common comorbidity of the dural injury . Exception for surgical decompression other clinically approved treatment for SCI is still limited . In this study an elastic gel consisting of natural polyphenol tannic acid and pluronic F 127 was prepared by a facile strategy . Comparing with traditional fibrin glue the prepared TA PF127 gel exhibited much higher bonding strength and sealing effect both

@highlight The gel has effects of antioxidant anti inflammation and anti apoptosis.
@highlight The gel can be used for simultaneous dura sealing and treatment of spinal cord injury.
