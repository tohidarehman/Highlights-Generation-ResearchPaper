 Benzodiazepines represent a class of privilege scaffold in the modern era of medicinal chemistry as CNS active agents and BZD based drugs are used to treat different psychotic disorders . Inspired from the therapeutic potential of BZDs as promising CNS active agents in the present work three different series of 1 5 benzodiazepines bearing various substitutions at position 2 and 4 of the benzodiazepine core were synthesized by condensing different substituted chalcones with
