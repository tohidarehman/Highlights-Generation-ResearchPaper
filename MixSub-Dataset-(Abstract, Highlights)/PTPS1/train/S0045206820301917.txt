 Triterpene bidesmosides are considered as highly cytotoxic saponins usually less toxic against normal cells than monodesmosides and less haemolytic . Biological activity of the betulin type bidesmosides rarely found in Nature and seldom prepared due to serious synthetic problems is poorly recognized . We report herein a protocol for the preparation of disubstituted lupane saponins by treatment of their benzoates with potassium carbonate in dichloromethane methanol solution . Cytotoxicity of all compounds was tested
