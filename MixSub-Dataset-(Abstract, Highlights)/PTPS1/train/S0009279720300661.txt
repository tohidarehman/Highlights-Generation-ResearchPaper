 The mortality rates for acute myeloid leukemia are very high necessitating the search for novel chemotherapeutic candidates . Herein we investigated the anticancer potential of a new synthetic compound 2 ethyl 3 methyliden 1 tosyl 2 3 dihydroquinolin 4 1

@highlight Anticancer potential of a new quinolinone analog was assessed.
@highlight AJ 374 was highly cytotoxic for HL 60cells but not for healthy HUVEC cells.
@highlight AJ 374 induced apoptosis by intrinsic and extrinsic pathway without ROS generation.
@highlight The compound promoted the cell cycle arrest in the subG0 G1 phase.
