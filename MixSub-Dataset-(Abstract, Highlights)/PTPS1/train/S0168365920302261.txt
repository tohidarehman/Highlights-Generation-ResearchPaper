 The epithelium is a formidable barrier to the absorption of orally delivered nano vehicles . Here by exploring a nutrient absorption pathway a self amplified nanoplatform was developed to promote apical to basolateral transcytosis across the epithelium . The nanoplatform consisted of fructose modified polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles and a sweetener acesulfame potassium in combination . Compared with regular PEGylated nanoparticles the combination exhibited a 3.9 fold increase of absorption following oral gavage in mice and an 8.8 fold increase of transepithelial transport in vitro . When encapsulated with insulin the combination regimen elicited a stronger hypoglycemic effect with a pharmacological bioavailability of 18.56 which was 3.2 fold higher than that of PEG NPs . We demonstrated that a large proportion of Fru PEG NPs underwent internalization and basolateral exocytosis via a glucose transporter type 2 dependent process which is an important fructose assimilation pathway . Notably co administered AceK could prime the epithelial cells with increased apical distribution of GLUT2 thus amplifying this unidirectional transcytosis of nanoparticles . This work is the first proof of concept study of manipulating and amplifying a nutrient absorption pathway to facilitate the unidirectional trans epithelial transport of orally administered nano delivery vehicles .
