 The incidence and mortality of lung cancer are the highest among cancer related deaths . However the long term use of currently available cytotoxic drugs can increase genetic alterations in cancer cells and cause drug resistance which significantly limits their usage . Since current systemic treatment options are limited effective chemotherapeutic agents are urgently needed for non small cell lung cancer treatment . In this study we demonstrated that ganoderic acid DM could increase apoptosis in A549 and NCIH460 NSCLC cells . GA DM treatment decreased the protein expression levels of Bcl 2 and increased the expression levels of Bax cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PRAP . Furthermore GA DM could promote autophagic flux and the cytotoxic effect against cancer cells of GA DM was significantly inhibited by targeted suppression of autophagy suggesting that autophagy contributed to GA DM induced cell death in NSCLC . Moreover GA DM clearly induced autophagy by inactivating the PI3K Akt mTOR pathway . When overexpression of Akt reactivated Akt mTOR pathway in A549 or NCIH460cells the increase of autophagy related marker LC3B II and apoptosis related protein cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 and the ration of apoptotic cells by GA DM was reversed suggesting that GA DM promoted autophagy and apoptosis by inhibiting Akt mTOR pathway mediated autophagy induction . In conclusion our study indicated that GA DM can induce autophagic apoptosis in NSCLC by inhibiting Akt mTOR activity . .
