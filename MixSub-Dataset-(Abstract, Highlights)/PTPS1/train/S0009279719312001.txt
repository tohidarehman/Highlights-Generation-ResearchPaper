 The extensive use of silver nanoparticles in manufactured products will inevitably increase environmental exposure highlighting the importance of accurate toxicity assessments . A frequent strategy to estimate AgNP cytotoxicity is to use absorbance or fluorescent based assays . In this study we report that AgNPs with or without surface functionalizations and of different sizes can interfere with the spectrometric quantification of different dyes commonly used in cytotoxicity assays such as 3 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide neutral red Hoechst and Resazurin . Some AgNP types caused more interference than others which was dependent on the assay . Overall most AgNPs caused the direct reduction of MTT as well as Hoechst and NR fluorescence quenching and absorbed light at the same wavelength as NR . None of the AgNPs tested caused the direct reduction of Resazurin however depending on AgNP characteristics and concentration they may still promote fluorescence quenching of this dye . Our results show that AgNPs with different size and coatings can interfere with spectroscopy based assays to different degrees suggesting that their cytotoxicity may be underestimated or overestimated . We suggest that when using any spectroscopy based assay it is essential that each individual nanoparticle formulation be tested first for potential interferences at all intended concentrations .

@highlight Most of the AgNPs tested and silver ions caused the direct reduction of MTT.
@highlight Some AgNPs caused fluorescence quenching of Hoechst and Neutral red dyes.
@highlight All AgNPs tested showed negligible interference with Resazurin dye.
@highlight Interference is dependent on the AgNP type and dye.
@highlight We recommend interference testing of AgNP with spectroscopy based assays.
