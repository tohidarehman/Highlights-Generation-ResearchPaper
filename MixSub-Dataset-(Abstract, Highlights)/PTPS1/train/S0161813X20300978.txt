 Exposure to organophosphates during the First Gulf War is among one of the factors for Gulf War Illness development in veterans and it has been challenging to treat GWI symptoms with existing therapies . Ketamine produces a rapid onset and sustained antidepressant response but there is no evidence whether ketamine treatment is effective for GWI depression . Repeated low dose exposure to diisopropyl fluorophosphate mimic Gulf War related OP exposures and produces a chronic depressive state in rats . In this study DFP exposed rats treated with ketamine exhibited antidepressant like effect on the Forced Swim Test at 1 h. This effect persisted at 24 h post ketamine a time point by which it is eliminated from the brain suggesting involvement of mechanisms that affect long term synaptic plasticity . Western blot analysis showed significantly lower Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor levels in DFP rat brains . Ketamine produced a nonsignificant increase in BDNF expression at 1 h but produced a larger significant increase at 24 h in DFP rats . We previously reported chronic hippocampal calcium elevations Ca

@highlight Repeated low dose DFP exposure in rats elicited chronic depression like state
@highlight Low dose ketamine produced a rapid and persistent antidepressant like effect in DFP rats
@highlight Inhibition of the NMDAR Ca
@highlight contributed to ketamines rapid antidepressant effect in DFP rats
@highlight Upregulation of BDNF contributed to ketamines persistent antidepressant effect in DFP rats
