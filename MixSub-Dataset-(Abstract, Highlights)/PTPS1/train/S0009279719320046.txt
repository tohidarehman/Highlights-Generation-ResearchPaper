 Early initiated decontamination is demonstrated to be crucial to avoid systemic effects of highly toxic and low volatile agents exposed on the skin . Skin decontamination can be performed by simple procedures such as washing with soap and water or by using advanced decontamination products containing absorption and agent degradation properties . Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion has demonstrated high efficacy to remove nerve agents from the skin . However contrary to the current operational recommendations experimental studies have shown that prolonged skin contact time of RSDL is important for efficient decontamination of VX . In the present study several RSDL protocols were evaluated for the efficacy to remove neat VX from human skin

@highlight Repeated swabbing and time for RSDL to act on skin is important for VX decontamination.
@highlight For decontamination of nerve agents water content should be kept low to avoid a wash in effect.
@highlight Soapy water decontamination significantly increased skin penetration of VX.
