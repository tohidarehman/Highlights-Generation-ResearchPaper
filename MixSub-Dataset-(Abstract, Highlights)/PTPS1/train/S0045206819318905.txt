 In this study human lung cancer SPC A 1 cells were cultured with Seleno Chitosan to study the mechanism of apoptosis . CCK 8 results showed that with the increase of the concentration of Seleno Chitosan and the prolongation of culture time the inhibition on the proliferation of SPC A 1 cells gradually increased and the morphology of SPC A 1 cells changed obviously . Flow cytometry result suggested that the concentration of calcium ion level of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential increased . Western blot showed that Seleno Chitosan induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in SPC A 1 . Eventually we found 15 proteins that were expressed abnormally by Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry which were all related to Fas FasL pathway of cells .

@highlight It was the first time to introduced the Selenium into chitosan.
@highlight The mechanism of SPC A 1 apoptosis induced by chitosan was demonstrated for the first time.
@highlight Expression of different proteins and signaling pathways after apoptosis were identified by flow cytometry western blot and MALDI TOF MS.
