 Oxidative stress defense system stands for the vulnerability of tumor cells because of the stronger oxidative stress existing in tumor sites . TRPA 1 has been found to be overexpressed in various tumors related to the tumor proliferation and metastasis and promote reactive oxygen species and chemotherapy tolerance through Ca

@highlight Enhanced anti tumor and anti metastasis efficacy based on the combination of TRPA 1inhibitor and DOX.
@highlight Enhanced tumor targeting and deep penetrating delivery based on HAase responsive cluster bomb.
@highlight TRPA 1 inhibition by AP 18 reversed the DOX induced Ca
@highlight influx and AKT phosphorylation.
@highlight TRPA 1 inhibition by AP 18 was found to reverse EMT process which would be related to its anti metastasis effect.
