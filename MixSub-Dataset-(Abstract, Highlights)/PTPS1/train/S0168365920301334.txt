 Non viral gene delivery systems have proven to be a promising approach in the treatment of brain metastatic cancers but facing delivery difficulties . Due to the existence of bloodbrain barrier non viral gene carriers must pass through brain capillary endothelial cells to accumulate at the brain tumor sites . However during this process most of them trap into brain capillary endothelial cells and fail to penetrate to the brain tumor sites . Autophagy is involved in dynamic disposition of both intracellular and extracellular components which theoretically affects intracellular fate of non viral gene carriers during BBB penetration . In the present study R6dGR peptide modified PEGylated polyethyleneimine that carry therapeutic gene encoding human tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand PPR

@highlight Autophagy mediated lysosome pathway is involved in the degradation of PPR 
@highlight TRAIL.
@highlight Inhibition of BBB autophagy increases brain accumulation of PPR 
@highlight TRAIL.
@highlight Wortmannin and TRAIL synergistically induce apoptosis of MDA MB 231 cells.
