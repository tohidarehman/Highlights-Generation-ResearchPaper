 Extracellular vesicles are secreted cell derived membrane particles involved in intercellular signaling and cell cell communication . By transporting various bio macromolecules ECVs and in particular exosomes are relevant in various physiological processes . ECVs are also released by cancer cells and can confer pro tumorigenic effects . Their target cell tropism effects on proliferation rates natural stability in blood and immunotolerance makes ECVs particularly interesting as delivery vehicles .

@highlight Extracellular vesicles ECVs are particularly interesting as delivery vehicles.
@highlight Polyethylenimines PEIs are capable of forming complexes with siRNAs or antimiRs.
@highlight Here the combination of PEI siRNA complexes with ECVs from tumor cells is explored.
@highlight ECV modified PEI siRNA complexes show improved physical and biological properties.
@highlight ECV modified PEI siSurvivin complexes inhibit prostate carcinoma xenografts in vivo.
