 Alzheimers disease is a complex neurodegenerative disease with multiple pathological features . Multifunctional compounds able to simultaneously interact with several pathological components have been considered as a solution to treat the complex pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases . carboline and cinnamic acid have been extensively studied for their widespread biological effects in treatment of AD further application is limited due to its poor solubility and high toxicity . Herein a series of carboline cinnamic acid hybrids was designed and synthesized to obtain new multifunctional molecules with low toxicity and good physicochemical properties . In particular

@highlight A new carboline cinnamic acid hybrids were designed synthesized as multifunctional agents for the treatment of AD.
@highlight and
@highlight exhibited significant inhibition of A aggregation moderate BuChE inhibition excellent neuroprotective effects.
@highlight and
@highlight appeared wonderful cognitive improvement in an acute AD mice model and did not exhibit any acute toxicity
@highlight at a relatively high dose of 600mg kg.
