 Eicosanoids like leukotrienes and prostaglandins that produced within the arachidonic acid cascade are involved in the pathogenesis of pain acute and chronic inflammatory diseases . A promising approach for an effective anti inflammatory therapy is the development of inhibitors targeting more than one enzyme of this cascade . Aiming to develop balanced COX LOX inhibitors 4 aminosalicylate based thiazolinones having different substituents at the 5th position of the 4 thiazolinone ring

@highlight Synthesis of 23 new 4 aminosalicylate thiazolinone hybrids.
@highlight Testing the inhibitory potencies against COX and 15 LOX and
@highlight anti inflammatory activity.
@highlight The compounds have good safety profile they are neither cytotoxic nor ulcerogenic.
@highlight Molecular docking studies disclosed important binding modes with COX 2 and 15 LOX.
