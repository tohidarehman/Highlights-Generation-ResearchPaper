 To investigate the effect of gamabufotalin on metastasis and modulation of stemness features in osteosarcoma and the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects . Human osteosarcoma U2OS MG 63cell lines were used in this study . Cell proliferation migration and invasion were determined by MTT assay wound healing assay and cell invasion assay respectively . The inhibitive effect of GBT on stemness was assessed by flow cytometry and mammosphere formation . The protein levels of related proteins were detected by western blotting analysis . The effect of GBT on tumorigenicity and metastasis was determined by immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry We found that GBT suppressed the viability of U2OS MG 63cells in a time and dose dependent manner . Notably GBT had no effect on the viability of human fetal osteoblastic 1.19cells . Moreover GBT increased the width of wounds reduced the number of invasive osteosarcoma cells and reversed the epithelialmesenchymal transition phenotype . Notably we found that compared with hFOB1.19cells the levels of transforming growth factor periostin phosphorylated AKT Collectively our data demonstrated that GBT inhibited the viability and tumorigenesis capability of osteosarcoma cells by blocking the TGF periostin PI3K AKT signaling pathway . Therefore GBT may represent a promising therapeutic agent for the management of osteosarcoma .

@highlight Higher levels of TGF periostin p AKT PI3K were observed in osteosarcoma spheroids.
@highlight The TGF periostin PI3K AKT pathway promotes osteosarcoma procession.
@highlight GBT exerts an anti tumor effect by blocking osteosarcoma CSCs and invasion capacity.
