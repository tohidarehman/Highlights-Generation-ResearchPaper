 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now the most common chronic liver disease while there is still no medicine available . Farnesoid X receptor is considered as a potential target for the treatment of NAFLD and there are several FXR agonists reached in clinical trials . Based on better safety industry and academia are pursuing development of the partial FXR agonists . To extend the chemical space of existing partial FXR agonists we performed a structure activity relationship study based on previously reported partial agonist

@highlight The chemical space of partial FXR agonists was extended based on bioisosteric strategy.
@highlight Two series of novel partial FXR agonists were identified.
@highlight Compound
@highlight exhibited the best agonistic activity in this series.
@highlight Compound
@highlight alleviated hepatic steatosis and hepatic function index in NASH model.
@highlight This study provided promising lead compound to explore better partial FXR agonists.
