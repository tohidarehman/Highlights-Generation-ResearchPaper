 The aim of this study was the synthesis of ion doped silica based nanoparticles and the evaluation of their toxic effect on erythrocytes . Their synthesis was performed using the sol gel method by the progressive addition of calcium magnesium and copper ions on pure silica nanoparticles . The toxicity evaluation was based on hemolysis lipid peroxidation ROS H The addition of Mg and Cu in the SNs presented better hemocompatibility by protecting erythrocytes from oxidative stress . Ion doping with magnesium in the investigated calcium silicate system induces a protective effect in erythrocyte membrane in compare with pure silica nanoparticles .

@highlight Addition of Mg and Cu in SNs improved their hemocompatibility.
@highlight All SNs concentrations lower than 0.125mg mL are hemocompatible.
@highlight Ion doping in SNs protected erythrocytes from oxidative stress.
@highlight Higher amount of H
@highlight species detected by LC MS have been generated in un doped SNs.
