 Alzheimers disease is the most common form of dementia . While drugs that target several pathways underlying AD have been proposed effective treatments remain to be discovered . BACE1 an enzyme associated with AD progression is a promising target for developing anti Alzheimer drugs . To find novel multifunctional anti Alzheimer agents we designed and synthesized a series of new substituted benzyl 1

@highlight A series of
@highlight  Cyclohexylimidazo 1 2 
@highlight  pyridine derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Compound
@highlight displayed excellent BACE1 inhibitory activity IC
@highlight  8.9M .
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight showed selective butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory action at IC
@highlight values of 3.2 and 2.5 M respectively.
@highlight Compound
@highlight demonstrated effective antioxidant effect with an IC
@highlight value of 10.2M.
@highlight The promising Multi Target Directed Ligand
@highlight might be served as a potential anti Alzheimer agent.
