 Increasing studies have well documented the involvement of numerous lncRNAs in regulating the malignant phenotypes of various tumors including non small cell lung cancer cells . However up to date the effects and mechanism of lncRNA amine oxidase copper containing 4 pseudogene in NSCLC progression remain undefined . AOC4P expression in NSCLC cells was detected by qRT PCR . The protein levels of Wnt catenin pathway related proteins matrix metallopeptidase 2 and MMP 9 were examined by Western blot . The effects of AOC4P or combined with Wnt agonist BML 284 on the malignant phenotypes in NSCLC cells were explored by CCK 8 Transwell invasion assay flow cytometry analysis and caspase 3 7 activity . AOC4P was lowly expressed in NSCLC samples and cells . Overexpression of AOC4P inhibited viability the expression of MMP 2 and MMP 9 and invasion of NSCLC cells . Apoptosis and caspase 3 7 activity were suppressed in response to AOC4P overexpression in NSCLC cells . AOC4P overexpression suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model .

@highlight AOC4P was lowly expressed in NSCLC cells.
@highlight AOC4P overexpression inhibited the proliferation and the Wnt catenin pathway in NSCLC cells.
@highlight AOC4P overexpression suppressed the invasion and induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells.
@highlight AOC4P overexpression suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model.
