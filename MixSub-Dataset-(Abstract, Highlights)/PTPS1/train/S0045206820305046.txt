 Six derivatives of 3 phenylpropionic acid bearing various natural and natural like spatially defined peripheral motifs have been synthesized and evaluated in vitro for free fatty acid receptor 1 activation . Two frontrunner compounds were evaluated in an oral glucose tolerance test in mice where both demonstrated the ability to sustain blood glucose levels following a glucose challenge . The bornyl compound displayed a somewhat superior dose dependent efficacy and therefore can be regarded as a lead compounds for further development as a therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus . Its high affinity to FFA1 was rationalized by docking experiments .

@highlight FFA1 is a clinically validated antidiabetic target with no approved drugs on the market.
@highlight 3 Phenyl propionic acid is a known mimetic of endogenous ligands of FFA1.
@highlight Natural and natural like amines have been employed as periphery motifs.
@highlight Bornyl and cytisine bearing compounds were most active in vitro as FFA1 agonists.
@highlight In vivo efficacy testing oGTT showed the bornyl compound to be the lead compound.
