 In this study we assessed the efficacy of the Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion Kit against parathion and aldicarb pesticide dermal exposure in a guinea pig model . The pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase leading to signs and symptoms of hyperactivity of organs due to accumulation of acetylcholine . The RSDL Kit has been shown to physically remove and chemically degrade chemical warfare agents . Degradation occurs from a nucleophilic substitution reaction between an active ingredient in the RSDL lotion potassium 2 3 butanedione monoximate with susceptible sites in these compounds . In the present study guinea pigs dermally exposed to parathion and aldicarb were decontaminated with RSDL to mitigate the toxic effects of the pesticides .

@highlight Guinea pigs dermally exposed to parathion and aldicarb were decontaminated with RSDL.
@highlight RSDL Kit is an effective decontaminant against parathion and aldicarb pesticide.
@highlight Base on the in vivo study the Kit can help mitigate acute exposure from pesticides.
