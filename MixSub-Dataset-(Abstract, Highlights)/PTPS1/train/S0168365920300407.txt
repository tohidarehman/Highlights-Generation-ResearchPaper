 Glomerulonephritis related renal failure is a frequent cause of end stage renal disease and immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most frequent type of primary glomerulonephritis . As damage induced by IgAN mostly attributes to inflammation responses inhibiting inflammation in glomerulus can protect normal renal function and delay the onset of renal failure . Hence reducing levels of p38 MAPK and p65 which are essential regulators in p38 MAPK and NF B related inflammation responses could be effective against IgAN . Here we rationally designed and constructed size and surface charge dependent glomerulus targeting liposomal nanoparticles which are loaded with both p38 MAPK and p65 siRNA . Experiments show that our nanoparticles successfully crossed fenestrated endothelium accumulated in mesangial cells and endothelial cells efficiently silenced p38 MAPK and p65 genes and eventually alleviated proteinuria inflammation and excessive extracellular matrix deposition in mouse IgAN models . This siRNA co delivery system thus represents a promising treatment option for IgAN and offers a versatile platform for other glomerular problems . Our work also highlights a novel strategy of glomerulus targeting and an encouraging therapeutic route for other inflammatory diseases .
