 This study aimed to investigate the effects of teaghrelin an active ingredient of Chin shin oolong tea on murine C2C12 myoblast cells . Under high serum conditions teaghrelin inhibited C2C12cell proliferation indicating a cell cycle arrest and cessation of proliferative progression . Teaghrelin promoted pro differentiation of C2C12cells as evidenced by a progressively elongated morphology as well as the induction of muscle specific myogenin myosin heavy chain and MyoD . The formation of multinucleated myotubes and the increase of MHC positive immunoreactivity within the myotubes further reflected a complete differentiation and maturation of the contractile skeletal muscle cells induced by teaghrelin . Like ghrelin teaghrelin attenuated dexamethasone decreased myotube diameter indicating its protective effects against skeletal muscle atrophy . Additionally the expressions of Atrogin 1 and MuRF 1 ubiquitin E3 ligase were reduced . In conclusion the results highlight a possibility of developing teaghrelin as a functional food for the prevention or therapeutic treatment of disease associated skeletal muscle atrophy .
