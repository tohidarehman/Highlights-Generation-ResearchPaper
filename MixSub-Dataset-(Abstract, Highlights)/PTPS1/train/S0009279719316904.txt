 Homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 has emerged as a crucial stress responsive kinase that plays a critical role in regulating cell survival and apoptosis . However whether HIPK2 participates in regulating cardiomyocyte survival during myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury remains unclear . Here we investigated the regulatory effect of HIPK2 on hypoxia reoxygenation induced cardiomyocyte injury and its potential underlying molecular mechanism . We found that HIPK2 expression was induced in response to H R exposure . HIPK2 depletion by small interfering RNA mediated gene silencing significantly decreased the viability and exacerbated H R induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production in cardiomyocytes . Comparatively HIPK2 overexpression effectively rescued H R impaired viability and repressed H R induced apoptosis and ROS production in cardiomyocytes . HIPK2 overexpression significantly increased the nuclear expression of nuclear factor like 2 and enhanced Nrf2 mediated transcriptional activity . Moreover HIPK2 overexpression significantly increased the transcription of Nrf2 ARE target genes . Additionally Nrf2 inhibition partially reversed the HIPK2 mediated protective effect . Overall these results demonstrate that HIPK2 overexpression protects cardiomyocytes from H R induced injury by enhancing Nrf2 ARE antioxidant signaling data that suggest HIPK2 is a potential target for cardioprotection .
