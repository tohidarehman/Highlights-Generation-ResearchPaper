Studies have demonstrated that alcohol intake increases the risk of breast cancer and alcohol also stimulates breast cancer cell growth . Deregulation of Pol III genes is tightly associated with tumour development . Transcription factor II B related factor 1 is a transcription factor that specifically regulates Pol III gene transcription . Our

@highlight Betaine decreases the rates of breast cancer cell proliferation and colony formation caused by alcohol.
@highlight The inhibiting role of betaine in alcohol increased the rates of breast cancer cell growth was in a dose dependent manner.
@highlight Betaine represses Brf1 and Pol III gene transcription resulting in the inhibition of the cell growth and colony formation.
