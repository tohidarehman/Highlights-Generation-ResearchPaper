 Epigenetics plays a fundamental role in cancer progression and developing agents that regulate epigenetics is crucial for cancer management . Among Class I and Class II HDACs HDAC8 is one of the essential epigenetic players in cancer progression . Therefore we designed synthesized purified and structurally characterized novel compounds containing

@highlight N substituted TZDs 
@highlight were designed synthesized structurally characterized.
@highlight Compound
@highlight was most active against HDAC8 and produced thermal stabilization.
@highlight It showed apoptotic cell death and cytotoxicity in leukemic cell lines.
@highlight also interfered with glucose transporter 1 GLUT1.
@highlight It was also found less cytotoxic on non cancerous cells WBCs and HS27 .
