 Apart from its hypoglycaemic properties metformin also offers beneficial effects for the cardiovascular system resulting in significant reduction of diabetes related death and all cause mortality . The aim of this study was to synthesize nine new benzenesulfonamide derivatives of metformin with a halogen substituent and estimate their influence on selected parameters of plasma and vascular hemostasis .

@highlight Nine benzenesulfonamide biguanides with
@highlight  
@highlight  and
@highlight  chloro bromo and fluoro substituents we synthesized.
@highlight  derivatives chloro bromo and fluoro significantly prolong PT and APTT.
@highlight None of the synthesized compounds exert an unfavourable effect on erythrocyte integrity.
@highlight Synthesized compounds do not decrease HUVEC and AoSMC cells viability up to 1.5mol mL.
@highlight  halogenated benzenesulfonamides are potential agents with stronger anti coagulant properties than parent drug metformin.
