 Metastatic progression of cancer is a complex and clinically daunting process with migration invasion and angiogenesis being the key features . Tetrandrine is a typical dibenzylisoquinoline alkaloid with promising anti tumor activity . In our previous work a number of TET derivatives were designed and synthesized with obvious anti proliferation activities against cancer cells however the anti metastatic effects of these compounds were not evaluated . In the current investigation five TET derivatives
