 Mammalian carboxylesterases are essential members of serine esterase hydrolase superfamily which are widely distributed in many tissues including liver intestine lung and kidney . CESs play an important role in the metabolism of various xenobiotics including ester drugs and environmental toxicants and also participate in lipid homeostasis so the development of CESs activity detection techniques are of great significance for drug discovery and biomedical research . With the rapid development of separated and detection technologies such as chromatography capillary electrophoresis fluorescent probe based detection technology bioluminescent sensor and colorimetric sensor in recent decade the research of physiological functions of CESs have make huge breakthrough . This review summarizes the development and application of CESs activity detection techniques as well as comparatively analyzes the characteristics of various detection techniques . The information and knowledge represented here will help the researchers carry out various biochemical studies for understanding activation mechanism and role of CESs in drug metabolism .
