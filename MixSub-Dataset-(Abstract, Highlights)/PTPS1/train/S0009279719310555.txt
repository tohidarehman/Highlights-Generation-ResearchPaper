 Currently few herbal pharmacokinetic parameters have been applied successfully for therapeutic monitoring because of the complexity of consistency when there are multiple chemicals and efficacies . The present study aims to evaluate the herbal PK properties by investigating the PK parameters of the 8 absorbed bioactive compounds which can represent its parent herbal holistic efficacy to achieve a PK therapeutic monitoring of herbs . First we tested the hypothesis that the antidepressant and prokinetic effects and related anti inflammation and anti oxidation activity by Fructus aurantii Magnolia Bark formula are related to 8 compounds according to the absorbable evidence and the determined contents . Subsequently stable and representative APIO from 8ABCs allowed us to develop a sensitive and selective liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of 8 compounds following the oral administration of FM decoction in rats . Result 8 compounds either including Meranzin hydrate or MH alone almost identically or nearly replicated the parent formula FM in terms of efficacy for inducing APIO . This unifying strategy shows how multi herb formulas pharmacokinetic therapeutic monitoring can be achieved by the method we established .

@highlight The activity by Fructus aurantii Magnolia Bark formula are related to 8 compounds.
@highlight 8 compounds almost replicated the parent formula FM in terms of efficacy.
@highlight The Pharmacokinetic of the 8 absorbed compounds in rats are studied.
