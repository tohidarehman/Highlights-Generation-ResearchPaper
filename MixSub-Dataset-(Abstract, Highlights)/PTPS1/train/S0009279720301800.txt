 Till now monocrotophos has been addressed as a neurotoxic stressor . Limited studies investigate its aftermath on bone pathologies . Given the fact that MCP is a propensely used insecticide in developing countries this study investigates its potential to mirror osteoporotic features and bone loss incurred in a rodent model . Briefly Swiss albino mice were orally gavaged daily with varying doses of MCP for 8 weeks . Musculoskeletal changes were analyzed through micro computed tomography and histology . A series of

@highlight Oral gavaging of MCP to Swiss albino mice mimic human trabecular bone loss.
@highlight MCP induced loss of bone mass is due to increased osteoclastogenesis.
@highlight This model can be used for osteoporotic preclinical therapeutic investigations.
