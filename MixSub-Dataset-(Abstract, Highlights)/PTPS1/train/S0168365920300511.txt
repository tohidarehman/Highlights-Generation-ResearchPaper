 Image guided therapy combined with imaging and therapeutic action forms an attractive system because it can induce outstanding effects at focused locations . However the conventional liposomes based system can not figure in therapeutic or imaging roles themselves thereby causing the disadvantage of their biological unavailability as a theragnosis tool . Herein the structure inherent near infrared bilayernanovesicles are fabricated with amphiphilic heptamethine cyanine dye PEG conjugated heptamethine cyanine dye and gemcitabine is developed for the novel photoacoustic image guided chemo thermotherapy system . The organic structure inherent near infrared bilayernanovesicles are self assembled and exhibit a liposome like bilayer structure . Furthermore NEPCG showed the high photoacoustic signal due to the specific accumulation in the tumor site . Delivered NEPCG than displayed concurrent chemotherapy and photothermal therapy effects against cancer triggered by PA imaging with minimal side effects . In vitro and in vivo experiments show that NEPCG can be used as outstanding contrast agents and completely obliterate the tumor without reoccurrence under laser irradiation . Therefore this work presents the potential for the realization of unprecedented structure inherent near infrared bilayernanovesicles as highly accurate and effective theragnostic tools in clinical fields .
