 The success in the application of nanomedicines for tumor therapy is largely dependent on the development of efficient tumor targeting specific and effective drug delivery systems . Here through a simple synthetic process we developed a type of novel glucose transporter 1 targeting tumor microenvironment responsive and near infrared irradiation induced cytosolic drug delivery nanoparticles . Our design was based on polydopamine NPs as the photothermal agent and drug delivery carrier glucosyl functional ligands as the GLUT1 targeting agents and the conjugation of anticancer drug bortezomib to the catechol groups of PDA NPs in a pH dependent manner . The

@highlight We developed the glucose functionalized PDA nanoparticles with pH responsive and photothermally triggered cytosolic drug delivery properties.
@highlight The mussel inspired PDA nanoparticles act as the photothermal agent and delivery carrier.
@highlight The glucosyl functional ligands as GLUT1 targeting agents enhance the tumor specific delivery efficiency of PDA nanoparticles.
@highlight The conjugation of anticancer drug BTZ by acid sensitive bond facilitates the selective drug release in response to pH and external NIR stimuli.
@highlight NIR irradiation further triggers effective endo lysosomes escape and cytosolic delivery of the functionalized PDA nanoparticles.
