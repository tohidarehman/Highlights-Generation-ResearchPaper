 Quinoline derivatives have been reported to possess enticing pharmacological properties . In particular quinoline chalcones are identified as promising scaffolds for drug discovery . For a long the quinoline analogs have been in clinical use for various medical conditions such as cancer inhibitory activity antibacterial and antifungal anti plasmodial DNA damage inhibitory activity etc . The number of causalities recorded because of the above mentioned clinical states is significantly large . Though drug design and discovery is a continuous process all over the world issues like drug resistance low metabolic stability and long range side effects are potential hindrances for the continuous use of present pharmacological drugs .
