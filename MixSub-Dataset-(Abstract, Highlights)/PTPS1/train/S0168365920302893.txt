 The recent designs of dynamic nanoassemblies exploiting the tumor targeting properties have received increasing attention for tumor imaging and therapy due to their tumor specific delivery and enhanced antitumor efficacy . However these designs are mainly focused on the macroscopic tumor therapeutic effect while the nano bio interactions in the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood . This review aims to provide an overview of the development of tumor responsive nanoassemblies towards the imaging therapy and TME modulation in the tumor site . The tumor biology leading to TME formation and the potential TME properties for the practicable design of tumor targeting nanoassemblies has been outlined . Furthermore the various approaches for TME modification and the realization via dynamic nanoassemblies for enhanced tumor therapy were reviewed . Lastly the prospects of these methods were briefly discussed . These strategies may inspire the development of new combinational cancer therapeutics .
