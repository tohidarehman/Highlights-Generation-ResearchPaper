 In anti cancer therapy targeting a single gene or a single metabolic pathway usually can not effectively cure cancer while targeting cellular mitochondria might be effective based on the role of mitochondria in the occurrence and development of cancer . Anti cancer study on ginsenosides AD 1 AD 2 and PD have proved that they have broad spectrum anti cancer activities

@highlight A series of new mitochondria targeting conjugates were synthesized.
@highlight Most of conjugates possessed enhanced cytotoxicity and higher selectivity.
@highlight Conjugate
@highlight had an IC
@highlight value of 0.76
@highlight M against MCF 7 cells.
@highlight could accumulate in mitochondria and cause apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway.
@highlight Designed conjugates provided a reference for development of ginsenoside as mitocans.
