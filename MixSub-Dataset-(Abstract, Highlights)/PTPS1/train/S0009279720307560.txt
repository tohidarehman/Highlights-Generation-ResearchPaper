 Extensive application of methylene blue for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes and reports for unwanted side effects demand better understanding of the mechanisms of biological action of this thiazine dye . Because MB is redox active its biological activities have been attributed to transfer of electrons generation of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant action . Results of this study show that MB is more toxic to a superoxide dismutase deficient

@highlight SOD deficient mutants are hypersensitive to methylene blue.
@highlight Methylene blue induces enzymes controlled by the
@highlight regulon.
@highlight Induction of enzymes depended on
@highlight protein synthesis.
@highlight Methylene blue activates the
@highlight regulon by intracellular redox cycling.
