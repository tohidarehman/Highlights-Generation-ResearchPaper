 Hydrogels for biomedical applications such as controlled drug release are usually synthesized with the chemical or physical crosslinking of monomers or macromers . In this work we used gelatin to prepare hydrogel nanoparticles and studied whether gelatin nanoparticles could assemble to form a solid biomaterial and whether this solid biomaterial was capable of transforming into a hydrogel upon introduction to a hydrated environment . The data show that GNPs with or without aptamer functionalization could form a nanoparticle assembled porous solid biomaterial after freezing and lyophilization treatment . This formation did not need any additional crosslinking reactions . More importantly this solid biomaterial could undergo solid to hydrogel transition after contacting a solution and this transformation was tunable to match different shapes and geometries of defined molds . The formed hydrogel could also sequester and release growth factors for the promotion of skin wound healing . Thus GNP assembled solid biomaterials hold great potential as an off the shelf therapy for biomedical application such as drug delivery and regenerative medicine .
