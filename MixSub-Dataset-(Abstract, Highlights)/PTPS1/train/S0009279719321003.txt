 The inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase is a frequently used therapeutic option to treat Alzheimer s disease . By decreasing the levels of acetylcholine degradation in the synaptic space some cognitive functions of patients suffering from this disease are significantly improved . Rivastigmine is one of the most widely used AChE inhibitors . The objective of this work was to determine the effects of this drug on human erythrocytes which have a type of AChE in the cell membrane . To that end human erythrocytes and molecular models of its membrane constituted by dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine were used . They correspond to classes of phospholipids present in the outer and inner monolayers of the human erythrocyte membrane respectively . The experimental results obtained by X ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry indicated that rivastigmine molecules were able to interact with both phospholipids . Fluorescence spectroscopy results showed that rivastigmine produce a slight change in the acyl chain packing order and a weak displacement of the water molecules of the hydrophobic hydrophilic membrane interface . On the other hand observations by scanning electron microscopy showed that the drug changed the normal biconcave shape of erythrocytes in stomatocytes and echinocytes .

@highlight XRD and DSC indicated that rivastigmine interacted with DMPC and DMPE bilayers.
@highlight Rivastigmine induces morphological alterations in human erythrocytes.
@highlight Rivastigmine molecules locate in both monolayers of the human erythrocyte membrane.
