 CXCL12 is a chemokine known to regulate migration proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells and to play a neuroprotective role in ischemic stroke . Chitosan dextran sulfate nanocomplexes are known nanoparticulated systems used to efficiently deliver heparin binding factors . Here we evaluate Ch DS NC as carriers for CXCL12 in a mouse model of stroke . Free CXCL12 reduced the size of the ischemic brain lesion . However when Ch DS NC were administrated the stroke volume increased . Neurotoxic screening revealed that Ch DS NC reduced neuronal viability decreased the extension of neurites and impaired NSC migration

@highlight Chitosan dextran sulfate nanocomplexes Ch DS NC increased stroke volume
@highlight Ch DS NC reduced neural cells viability
@highlight Ch DS NC altered neural cells morphology
@highlight Free CXCL12 but not CXCL12 Ch DS NC was able to reduce ischemic area.
