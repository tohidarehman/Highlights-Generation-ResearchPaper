 Starting from the compound cyclopent 1 en 1 yl methanone two diols and three tetrol derivatives were synthesised . Morover from the reactions of 1 3 dimethoxybenzene and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene with adipoyl chloride fifteen new along with nine known compounds were obtained . For the characterizations of compounds spectroscopic methods such as NMR including DEPT COSY HMQC and HMBC experiments and X ray diffraction were used . The antioxidant activities of novel synthesized seventeen molecules were investigated by analytical methods like ABTS
