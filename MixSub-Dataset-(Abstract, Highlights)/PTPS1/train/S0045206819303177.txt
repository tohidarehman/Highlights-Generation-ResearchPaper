 Structureactivity relationship studies were conducted in the search for 1 3 thiazole isosteric analogs of imidazopyridine drugs . Three series of novel aminobutyric acid receptor GABA

@highlight Three series of novel GABA
@highlight R positive allosteric modulators PAMs were designed.
@highlight In each series lead compounds were discovered using radioligand competition binding assay.
@highlight A number of ligands exhibited affinity for GABA
@highlight Rs BZD binding site lower to the reference drug.
@highlight Functional properties of lead compounds were determined by electrophysiological measurements.
@highlight Biological efficacy of compounds was demonstrated
@highlight in behavioral assays using zebrafish.
@highlight Active compounds were safe and non toxic.
@highlight Structural basis for activity of lead compounds were proposed using molecular docking studies.
