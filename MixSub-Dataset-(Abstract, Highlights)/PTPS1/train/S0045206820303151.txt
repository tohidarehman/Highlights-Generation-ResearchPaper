 Stimulator of interferon genes is an endoplasmic reticulum adaptor facilitating innate immune signaling . Activation of STING leads to expression of interferons and pro inflammatory cytokines which is associated with antiviral and antitumor responses . It is imperative to discovery potent compounds that precisely modulate STING . Herein we describe the discovery of triazoloquinoxaline

@highlight A novel scaffold STING agonist was identified via virtual screening.
@highlight Compound
@highlight can directly bind to STING C terminal domain
@highlight concentration dependently stimulated mRNA expression of IFN CXCL 10 and IL 6.
@highlight induced the activation of STING and its downstreamTBK1 IRF3 signaling axis.
