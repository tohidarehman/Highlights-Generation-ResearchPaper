 Zinc is the second abundant trace element in the human central nervous system . Zinc homeostasis is impaired in the elderly population and Alzheimers disease patients . Due to the failures of amyloid and microtubule associated protein tau targeting drugs many researchers consider AD as a multifactorial disease . Emerging evidence demonstrates that zinc is also widely associated with the development of AD . Zinc dyshomeostasis hypothesis of AD has been proposed . In this review we summarize the role of zinc in A production protein quality control redox homeostasis tau phosphorylation and BDNF signaling . Due to the multifunctional roles of zinc when zinc dyshomeostasis occurs it may influence these different biological activities . Zinc dyshomeostasis could be a therapeutic target for AD treatment . However there is no consensus on the zinc concentration alteration and the effect of zinc overload or zinc deficiency in AD patients mouse models and cell lines . Given these significant differences across reported studies it still needs a long time for clinical application in the treatment of AD .

@highlight Systematically reviewed the function of zinc ions in the development of AD.
@highlight Summarized zinc binding proteins and their effects on AD pathology of zinc binding.
@highlight Summarized the trend of zinc content in different cerebral regions of AD patients.
