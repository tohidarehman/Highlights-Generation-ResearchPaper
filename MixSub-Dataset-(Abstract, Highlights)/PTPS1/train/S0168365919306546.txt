 Recent pre clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of combining chemotherapy and sonodynamic therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer . Oxygen loaded magnetic microbubbles have been explored as a targeted delivery vehicle for this application . Despite preliminary positive results a previous study identified a significant practical challenge regarding the co alignment of the magnetic and ultrasound fields . The aim of this study was to determine whether this challenge could be addressed through the use of a magnetic acoustic device combining a magnetic array and ultrasound transducer in a single unit to simultaneously concentrate and activate the microbubbles at the target site .

@highlight A new ligand enabled attachment of drug combinations to microbubbles.
@highlight A combined probe enabled co alignment of magnetic and ultrasound fields for targeting.
@highlight Co aligning the fields increased drug deposition in a gel phantom a 40 .
@highlight Only the co aligned fields produced a reduction in tumour volume
