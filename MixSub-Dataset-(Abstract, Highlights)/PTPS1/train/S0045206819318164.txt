 A major limitation in the development of radiolabeled Exendin 4 analogues is an inability to efficiently and rapidly separate final products from precursors . This is important as lack of purity in the final product decreases probe efficiency . The purpose of this study was to develop a method to prepare the high purity imaging reagent

@highlight Unique radiolabel
@highlight F PTTCO Csy
@highlight  Exendin 4 was synthesized.
@highlight The synthetic process yielded high purity
@highlight F tracer.
@highlight Biodistribution studies and microPET imaging indicated that the tracer specifically localized to GLP 1R insulinomas.
@highlight The tracer was minimally concentrated by the kidney.
