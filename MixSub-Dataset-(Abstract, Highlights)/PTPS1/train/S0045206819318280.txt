 Recently interest in matrix metalloproteinases 10 and 13 has been revitalized with the growing knowledge on their relevance within the MMPs network and significance of their inhibition for treatment of various diseases like arthritis cancer atherosclerosis and Alzheimer . Within this approach dual MMP 10 13 inhibition was disclosed as new approach for targeted polypharmacology . While several efficient MMP 13 inhibitors are known very few potent and selective MMP 10 inhibitors were reported . This study describes the design synthesis and optimization of novel MMP 10 13 inhibitors with enhanced MMP 10 potency and selectivity towards polypharmacology . Starting with a lead fused pyrimidine based MMP 13 inhibitor with weak MMP 10 inhibition a structure based design of pyrimidine and fused pyrimidine scaffolds was rationalized to enhance activity against MMP 10 in parallel with MMP 13 . Firstly a series of 6 methyl pyrimidin 4 one hydrazones

@highlight Novel hydrazones
@highlight were cyclized to isomeric triazolo 4 3 
@highlight  pyrimidines
@highlight 5 Oxo 1 2 4 triazolo 4 3 
@highlight  pyrimidines exhibited higher MMP 10 13 inhibition than their regioisomers.
@highlight Inactive triazolopyrimidines were rearranged to the potent Dimroth products.
