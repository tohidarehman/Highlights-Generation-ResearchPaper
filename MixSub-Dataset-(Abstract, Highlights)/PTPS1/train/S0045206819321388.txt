 Based on the previous studies that revealed the valuable role of pyrazole scaffold in cancer management and VEGFR 2 inhibition a new set of pyrazole conjugated with pyrazoline triazolopyrimidine and pyrazolone moieties were synthesized and investigated for their anticancer efficiency against human breast cancer MCF 7 . The anticancer screening revealed the significant sensitivity of breast carcinoma towards compounds

@highlight New pyrazole derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Some compounds showed potent cytotoxic effect against MCF 7 and VEGFR 2 inhibition.
@highlight Compound 12c induced cell cycle arrest at G2 M phase and activated caspase 3.
@highlight Molecular docking study of the promising derivatives was performed.
