 We report the synthesis of new quinoline 2 one pyrazole hybrids and their antiapoptotic activity . This effect was studied in sight of decreasing tissue damage induced by I R in colon of rats using

@highlight Synthesis of new pyrazolo quinoline 2 ones.
@highlight NMR spectra as effective tool to elucidate the given structure.
@highlight Some compounds showed significant improvement for oxidative stress parameters MDA SOD GSH and NOx in comparison with model group and greater than NAC.
@highlight Colonic histopathological investigation was performed on all targeted compounds.
@highlight H E sections of some compounds revealed apparent normal colonic cells compared with NAC.
@highlight Docking studies with caspase 3 revealed that most of the tested compounds showed good binding with the enzyme.
