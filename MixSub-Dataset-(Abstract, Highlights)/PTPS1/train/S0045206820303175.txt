 Fatty acid hydroperoxides are free phyto oxylipins known for their crucial role as signalling molecules during plant defense mechanisms . They were also demonstrated to have direct biocidal activities against plant pathogens including gram negative bacteria . In the present work the biocidal effect of one linolenic fatty acid hydroperoxide namely 13 HPOT has been investigated on three plant pathogen gram negative bacteria

@highlight 13 hydroperoxi 9 11 15 octadecatrienoic acid 13 HPOT displays a high antibacterial activity.
@highlight 13 HPOT antibacterial activity is linked to its ability to interact with bacterial plasma membrane.
@highlight Phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin in the bacterial membrane play an important role in this activity.
@highlight 13 HPOT acts on the physical state of the bacterial membrane by slightly fluidizing it.
