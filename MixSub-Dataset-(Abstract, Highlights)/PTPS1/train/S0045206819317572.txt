 STING has become a focal point in immunology research and a target in drug discovery . The discovery of a potent human STING agonist is expected to revolutionize current anti virus or cancer immunotherapy . Inspired by the structure and function of murine STING specific agonists we rationally designed and synthesized four series of novel compounds for the enhancement of human sensitivity . In the cell based assay we identified six compounds from all the synthetic small molecules

@highlight The best human STING agonist 12b displayed similar activities with 23 cGAMP.
@highlight Compound 2g 9g and 12b can directly bind to the human STING protein.
@highlight The Structure Activity Relationships of synthetic compounds were discussed.
@highlight Compound 12b is better than 23 cGAMP in the induction of assorted cytokines.
