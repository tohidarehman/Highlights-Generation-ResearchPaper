 A diverse series of 1 2 4 oxadiazoles based substituted compounds were designed synthesized and evaluated as anticancer agents targeting carbonic anhydrase IX . Initial structure activity analysis suggested that the thiazole thiophene sulfonamide conjugates of 1 2 4 oxadiazoles exhibited potent anticancer activities with low M potencies . Compound

@highlight A diverse series of 1 2 4 oxadiazole based compounds bearing various substitutions was designed and synthesized.
@highlight Initial active molecule
@highlight for HCT 116 IC
@highlight  11.5 M cells and tumor associated hCAIX IC
@highlight  4.23 M was further optimized through SAR.
@highlight SAR optimized
@highlight shown better activities for HCT 116 cells IC
@highlight  6.0 M and hCAIX IC
@highlight  0.74 M .
@highlight have high binding affinity for CAIX and substantial affinity for HSA.
@highlight increased the levels of ROS apoptotic proteins inhibited colonogenic and migration potential of colon cancer cells.
