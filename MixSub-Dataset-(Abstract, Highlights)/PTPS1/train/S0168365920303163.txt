 Bioinformatically triple negative breast cancer and colon adenocarcinoma two typical cold cancers were found overexpressed PD L1 and CD47 respectively but neither of them showed satisfied response on its corresponding immune checkpoint blockade in clinic . The initial immunotherapeutic resistance to ICB was essentially attributed to the so called cold tumor immune milieu . To overcome tumor immunological tolerance against ICBs here we report a versatile nano modulator for point to point counteracting the immune suppressors meanwhile boosting tumor T cell infiltration . Small interfering RNA targeting indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase 1 was first co delivered with gemcitabine using our lab made biocompatible nanocages for relieving the immune brakes related to regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells . O

@highlight siRNA and gemcitabine were co delivered to tumors with one nanocarrier.
@highlight ICB was passive targeted delivered to tumors avoiding non targeting adverse effect.
@highlight ICB was precisely released in acid TME assuring its extracellular function.
@highlight The nano modulator possessed strung expansibility for delivering of diverse ICBs.
@highlight Eliciting a hot TME greatly potentiated ICB based treatment for the cold malignancies.
