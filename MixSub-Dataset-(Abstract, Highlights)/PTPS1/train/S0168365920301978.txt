 To date cancer phototherapy remains as an unsatisfactory method of cancer treatment due to the high probability of cancer recurrence an effect that is partly driven by tumor driven immunosuppression . Therefore we propose inducing adequate immune responses after photo tumor ablation may be critical to achieve a long term therapeutic effect of phototherapy . Here we engineered the photosensitizer chlorin e6 and the time honored immunoadjuvant aluminum hydroxide into bovine serum albumin by albumin based biomineralization as a novel nanosystem . After intravenous injection the nanoparticles not only destroyed tumor cells effectively but also protected animals against tumor rechallenge and metastasis by strongly inducing a systemic anti tumor immune response . Subsequent analysis demonstrated T cells accumulated in lymph nodes and infiltrated the tumor site elevating levels of immune indicators including serum antibody cytokine level and higher proportions of cytotoxic T cells and Th1 cells . These protective effects were not observed with commercially available alumina gels or when the aluminum hydroxide in the nanoparticles was replaced with ferric hydroxide . Therefore we present Al BSA Ce6 NPs as a novel and unique system for alumina adjuvants that serves as an effective approach for cancer therapy .

@highlight A nanoparticle system Al BSA Ce6 NPs synthesized by a biomineralization method for photo immunotherapy against melanoma.
@highlight Unique immunological properties and therapeutic effect were confirmed by comparison with alumina gel and Fe BSA Ce6 NPs.
@highlight A simple synthesis method using only FDA approved excipients provides great potential for clinical translation.
