 Vincristine an alkaloid extracted from vinca is often used in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs to treat a variety of cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia malignant lymphoma and neuroblastoma . However VCR possesses dose dependent neurotoxicity which is the main factor restricting its application . Vincristine induced peripheral neuropathy not only limits the dose of VCR and leads to the discontinuation of treatment but also triggers serious damage to the physical and mental health of patients . In addition VIPN brings huge healthcare costs to patients and society . Individuals with VIPN often exhibit mechanical allodynia sensory tactile disorders and numbness in the hands and feet . Unfortunately VIPN is easily ignored due to its variable symptoms which gives rise to insufficient research on the aetiology and pathogenesis of this disease thereby resulting in a lack of appropriate preventive and therapeutic management . We performed a comprehensive review of the latest findings on VIPN in terms of symptoms risk factors potential mechanisms and prevention and treatment measures . The purpose was to help clinicians better understand and accurately diagnose VIPN select appropriate intervention measures and reduce the damage to cancer patients .
