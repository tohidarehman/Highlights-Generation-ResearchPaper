 We previously reported that inorganic organic hybrid nanoparticles containing the synthetic glucocorticoid betamethasone show efficient anti inflammatory activity in mice . Here we employed IOH NPs with the chemical composition Gd

@highlight Gd containing IOH NPs allow to visualize organ distribution in living mice by MRI.
@highlight Intraperitoneal injection of IOH NPs results in a slow distribution to abdominal organs.
@highlight Uptake of IOH NPs occurs in a highly cell type specific manner.
@highlight IOH NPs are engulfed
@highlight macropinocytosis and localize to lysosomes.
