 Presence of Simple Sequence Repeats both in genic and intergenic regions have been widely studied in eukaryotes prokaryotes and viruses . In the current study we undertook a survey to analyze the frequency and distribution of microsatellites or SSRs in multiple genomes of

@highlight 919 SSRs were found across 55 members of the Coronaviridae family.
@highlight Genomes exhibit under representation of SSRs.
@highlight Commonly 1213nt long hexanucleotide repeats occupying the genic region.
@highlight Identified genic SSRs in SARS CoV 2 are under selection pressure against mutations.
@highlight 29 of the total bases covered by SSRs in SARS CoV 2 were found to be variants.
