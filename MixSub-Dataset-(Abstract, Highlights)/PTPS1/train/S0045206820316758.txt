 Brutons tyrosine kinase a non receptor tyrosine kinase is a member of the Tec kinases family and is essential for B cell receptor mediated signaling . BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib hold a prominent role in the treatment of B cell malignancies . Here we disclose a potent selective and covalent BTK inhibitor HZ A 005 currently in preclinical development . HZ A 005 demonstrated dose dependent activity in two xenograft models of lymphoma in vivo . It showed highly favourable safety pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in preclinical studies . On the basis of its potency selectivity and covalent mode of inhibition HZ A 005 reveals the potential to be a promising BTK inhibitor for a wide range of cancer indications .

@highlight A potent and irreversible BTK inhibitor with more than 50 fold selectivity against ITK EFGR L858R .
@highlight IC
@highlight on five tumor cell lines is less than 1 M.
@highlight HZ A 005 markedly decreases tumor growth in xenograft mouse models.
@highlight The C
@highlight of HZ A 005 after administration is about 2 fold than ibrutinib.
