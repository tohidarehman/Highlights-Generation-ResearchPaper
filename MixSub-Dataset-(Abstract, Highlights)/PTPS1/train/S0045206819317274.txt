 Protein kinase CK2 a heterotetrameric holoenzyme composed of two catalytic chains attached to a homodimer of regulatory subunits is a target for drug development for cancer therapy . Here we describe the tetraiodobenzimidazole derivative ARC 3140 a bisubstrate inhibitor addressing the ATP site and the substrate binding site of CK2 with extraordinary affinity

@highlight CK2 is a eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily member relevant for cancer therapy.
@highlight CK2 needs a heterotetrameric quaternary structure CK2

@highlight A picomolar affinity CK2 bisubstrate inhibitor results from a bromine iodine exchange.
@highlight Two CK2 bisubstrate inhibitors with additional affinity to CK2s CK2 site are found.
@highlight These dual functionality CK2 bisubstrate inhibitors disturb the CK2 CK2 interaction.
