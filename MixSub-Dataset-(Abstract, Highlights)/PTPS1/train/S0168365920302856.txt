 Disease microenvironment stimuli responsive hydrogels are of special interests in enhancing the drug delivery specificity for biomedical applications . In order to achieve specific drug release characteristic at the inflammation region a smart pH and reactive oxygen species responsive injectable hydrogel with self healing and remodeling capability was designed in our present work . By grafting phenylboronic acid to the side chain of the alginate polymer a highly specific dual responsive hydrogel with low pH and high ROS was obtained . Moreover the hydrogel was endowed with antibacterial and anti inflammatory properties respectively

@highlight The multi responsive hydrogels were constructed with a single and certain polymeric component.
@highlight The hydrogel had a variety of dynamic functions such as self healing reshaping and injectable.
@highlight The hydrogel exhibited excellent antibacterial efficacy via responsive drug release at the inflammation region.
@highlight The hydrogel could facilitate the wound healing by reducing the inflammation response of the surrounding tissues.
@highlight The hydrogel was good cytocompatibility and did not show side effects
