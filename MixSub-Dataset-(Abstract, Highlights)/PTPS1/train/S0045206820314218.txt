 Lymphoid specific tyrosine phosphatase which exclusively exists in immune cells and down regulates T cell receptor signaling has becoming a potent target for various autoimmune diseases . Herein we designed and synthesized imidazolidine 2 4 dione and 2 thioxothiazolidin 4 one derivatives as new LYP inhibitors . Among them the cinnamic acids based inhibitors

@highlight Novel imidazolidine 2 4 dione and 2 thioxothiazolidin 4 one derivatives were synthesized.
@highlight The most potent LYP inhibitor
@highlight exhibited selectivity against other PTPs.
@highlight Compound
@highlight regulated the TCR Signaling in lymphoid T cell.
