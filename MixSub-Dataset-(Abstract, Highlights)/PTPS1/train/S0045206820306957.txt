 Monoamine oxidase B inhibitory activity is closely regulated by the interaction of the small molecules with the enzyme . It is therefore desirable to use theoretical approaches to design rational methods to develop new molecules to modulate specific interactions with the protein . Here we report such methods and we illustrate their successful implementation by studying six synthetized 3 arylcoumarins
