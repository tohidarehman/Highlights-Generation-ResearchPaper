 Nanoparticles with encapsulated small molecules have attained vital importance in anticancer research . Peptide based nanoparticles show their versatility in drug delivery due to their excellent biocompatibility and nontoxic nature . We demonstrate here the design and fabrication of peptide based nanoparticles as dual therapeutic cargo for the controlled release of hydrophilic 5 Fluorouracil and hydrophobic camptothecin simultaneously . The covalent conjugation of 5Fu with the peptide through a stimuli responsive linker provided better control over the release of 5Fu and dramatically reduced the possibility of leaching of the small molecule . As anticipated the peptide 5Fu nanoparticles were efficient to encapsulate a second chemotherapeutic molecule CPT in its hydrophobic region . The stimuli responsive release of 5Fu was carefully monitored by HPLC NMR and UVvisible spectroscopy . On the other hand the release of the hydrophobic drug CPT from the nanoparticles was determined to be in a diffusion controlled fashion . Assessment of performance in human cervical HeLa cell lines demonstrated the peptide drug nanoparticles to be highly nontoxic . Whereas the simultaneous release of the two antitumor agents in a controlled manner resulting in rapid antiproliferation of the tumor cells .
