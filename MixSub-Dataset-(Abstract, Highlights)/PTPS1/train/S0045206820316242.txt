 SARS CoV 2 epidemic has created an unprecedented medical and economic crisis all over the world . SARS CoV 2 is found to have more contagious character as compared to MERS CoV and is spreading in a very fast manner all around the globe . It has affected over 31 million people all over the world till date . This virus shares around 80 of genome similarity with SARS CoV . In this perspective we have explored three major targets namely SARS CoV 2 spike protein RNA dependent RNA polymerase and 3CL or M

@highlight COVID 19 created an unprecedented medical and economic crisis all over the world.
@highlight Spike protein RNA dependent RNA polymerase and M
@highlight Protease are major targets for COVID 19.
@highlight Similarity and key amino acid interactions of these are compared with SARS CoV.
@highlight It will help to understand key amino acids essential for interactions at the active site of target proteins in SARS CoV 2.
