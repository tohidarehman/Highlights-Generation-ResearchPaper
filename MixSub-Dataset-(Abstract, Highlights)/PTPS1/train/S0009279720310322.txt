 Caffeic acid is a phenolic compound widely found in commonly consumed foods such as pears apples and coffee and is pharmacologically known for its antioxidant anti inflammatory and anti asthmatic properties . However its relaxant activity in the aorta uterus and ileum smooth muscle has not been investigated . This study aimed to comparatively evaluate the effect of caffeic acid on smooth muscle from different organs and the contractions of this different organ were induced by different agonists . The organ bath technique was used where the organs were placed in different cuvettes with 10mL of Tyrode solution for 1h to stabilize then myometrial intestinal strip and aortic ring contractions were evoked using different contractile agonists KCl 60mM PHE 0.1 M OT 10 2 IU mL CCh 10

@highlight Caffeic acid has a muscle relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle myometrial and intestinal.
@highlight Caffeic acid had an antispasmogenic effect on different organs aorta uterus and ileum of rats in the presence of K .
@highlight The relaxing effect of caffeic acid is partially dependent on the calcium channels operated by type L voltage.
@highlight Caffeic acid can be used as a therapeutic substance.
