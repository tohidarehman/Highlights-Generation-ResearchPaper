 A critical biological event that contributes to the appearance and progress of cancer and diabetes is the reversible phosphorylation of proteins a process controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases . Within the PTPs PTP1B has gained significant interest since it is a validated target in drug discovery . Indeed several PTP1B inhibitors have been developed from both synthesis and natural products . However none have been approved by the FDA due to their poor selectivity and or pharmacokinetic properties . One of the most significant challenges to the discovery of PTP1B inhibitors
