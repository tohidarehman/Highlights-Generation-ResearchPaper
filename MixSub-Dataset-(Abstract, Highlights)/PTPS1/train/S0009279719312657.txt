 1 2 3 triazolium salts are poorly understood regarding their antileishmanial activity . Hence as an effort to identify novel chemical scaffolds as antileishmanial agents a series of 1 2 3 triazolium salts

@highlight New triazoles derivatives were synthesized and assayed against
@highlight  with an iodide anion and a side chain of 10 carbon atoms showed the best selective biological activity.
@highlight presents itself as 1.5 times more active against intracellular amastigotes of
@highlight than miltefosine.
@highlight The antileishmanial activity is mediated via mitochondrial dysfunction.
