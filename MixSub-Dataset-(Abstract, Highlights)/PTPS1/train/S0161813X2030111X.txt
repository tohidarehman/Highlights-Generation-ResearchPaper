 The inhibitory glycine receptor is a key mediator of synaptic signalling in spinal cord brain stem and higher centres of the central nervous system . We examined the glycinergic activity of sarcophine a marine terpenoid known for its various biological activities and its trans diol derivative dihydroxy deepoxysarcophine . SN was isolated from the Red Sea soft coral

@highlight Sarcophin SN was isolated from the Red Sea Coral
@highlight  7S 8R Dihydroxydeepoxysarcophine DSN was prepared by semisynthesis from SN.
@highlight SN and DSN were inhibitors of recombinant glycine receptors GlyRs on HEK293 cells.
@highlight SN and DSN opposed strychnine toxicity against mice
@highlight Results suggest a binding site for SN and DSN near the strychnine site of GlyR.
