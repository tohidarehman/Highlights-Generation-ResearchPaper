 The microtubule inhibitor class of chemotherapeutics provide an effective treatment for several different types of cancers however severe chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy is a major dose limiting toxicity in patients that limits their use . While CIPN was predicted with MTIs based on histopathology and functional effects in non clinical toxicology studies these investigations often require large numbers of animals and long term studies . As

@highlight In vitro MT properties binding and dynamicity have been assessed for many MTIs.
@highlight MTI s with less severe CIPN have reduced
@highlight MT affinity and binding.
@highlight An MTI with less severe CIPN also had more MT binding in absence of neuronal MTs.
@highlight In vitro MT properties may be used to develop MTIs with less severe CIPN.
