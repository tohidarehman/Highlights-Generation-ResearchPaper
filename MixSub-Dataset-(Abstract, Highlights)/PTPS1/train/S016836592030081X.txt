 Multiple myeloma is a malignant blood cancer homing in bone marrow that is particularly hard to treat . The effective treatment for MM shall be not only MM selective but also capable of homing to bone marrow . Herein we report on hyaluronic acid directed reduction responsive chimaeric polymersomes encapsulating a key player in the NK cells granzyme B as an artificial killer cell for targeted protein therapy of MM . Interestingly HA RCP GrB displayed high MM targetability and anti MM activity with a remarkably low IC

@highlight Granzyme B loaded hyaluronic acid directed polymersomes HA RCP GrB were developed.
@highlight HA RCP GrB possessed CD44 targetability and high anti multiple myeloma activity.
@highlight HA RCP enhanced protein accumulation in subcutaneous LP1 multiple myeloma tumor.
@highlight HA RCP was able to deliver proteins to multiple myeloma cells in the bone marrow.
@highlight HA RCP GrB induced effective and low toxic treatment of orthotopic multiple myeloma.
