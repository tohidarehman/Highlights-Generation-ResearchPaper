 Selective inhibition of janus kinase has been identified as an important strategy for the treatment of autoimmune disorders . Optimization at the C2 and C4 positions of pyrimidine ring of Cerdulatinib led to the discovery of a potent and orally bioavailable 2 4 diaminopyrimidine 5 carboxamide based JAK3 selective inhibitor

@highlight Optimization at the C2 and C4 positions of pyrimidine ring of Cerdulatinib led to the discovery of a potent and orally bioavailable 2 4 diaminopyrimidine 5 carboxamide based JAK3 selective inhibitor 
@highlight  .
@highlight A cellular selectivity study further confirmed that
@highlight preferentially inhibits JAK3 over JAK1 in JAK STAT signaling pathway.
@highlight Compound
@highlight showed good
@highlight anti arthritic activity and safety profile.
@highlight Indicates that the new class JAK3 selective inhibitor could be viable therapeutic option for the treatment of RA.
