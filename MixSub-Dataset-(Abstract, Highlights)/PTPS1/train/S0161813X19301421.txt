 The increasing use of illegal drugs by pregnant women causes a public health concern because it is associated with health risks for mothers and their developing children . One of such drugs is MDMA or ecstasy due to its high consumption in relevant age and sex groups and its adverse effects on human and rodent developing brains . To thoroughly review the current knowledge on the developmentally neurotoxic potential of MDMA we systematically collected and summarized articles investigating developmental neurotoxicity of MDMA in humans and animals

@highlight We present a systematic review on DNT of MDMA in humans and animals
@highlight Main AO in humans impaired neuromotor function in infants.
@highlight AO in rats after postnatal exposure locomotor deficits impaired spatial learning.
@highlight Considering the AO in humans we summarized the findings in two hypothetical AOPs.
