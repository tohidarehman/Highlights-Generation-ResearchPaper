 A series of diarylurea derivatives comprising 2 4 diarylpyrimidines were synthesized based on a combination of postulated molecular hybridization design and failed ligands repurposing approaches which enabled the discovery of novel potential antiproliferative agents . Towards credible biological evaluation an

@highlight Hybridized pyrimidine urea series was designed and synthesized.
@highlight Compounds

@highlight showed broad spectrum antiproliferative activity.
@highlight and
@highlight were more potent than four FDA approved drugs against several cancer cells.
@highlight and
@highlight inhibited several members of the PVR family of kinases.
@highlight induced dose and time dependent apoptosis in A549 cell line.
