 Methylmercury is an environmental neurotoxicant found in fish that produces behavioral deficits following early developmental exposure . The impact of adolescent exposure to this developmental neurotoxicant is only recently being explored in animal models . Here short term memory and sustained attention were examined using a rodent model of adolescent methylmercury exposure . Rats were exposed to 0 0.5 or 5ppm methylmercury throughout the adolescent period and tested on a two choice visual signal detection task in adulthood . Methylmercury improved short term remembering in this procedure but the dose effect curve was nonmonotonic as has been reported previously effects on memory were observed in animals exposed to 0.5ppm methylmercury but not 5ppm . Methylmercury did not significantly alter sustained attention which is in contrast to effects following gestational exposure in human populations . The results may suggest that attention is not involved with previously reported effects of methylmercury during adolescence but certain procedural issues remain unresolved .

@highlight Gestational methylmercury is neurotoxic but its impact on the adolescent brain has been explored only recently.
@highlight Adolescent exposure affects delay discounting perseveration and sensitivity to drugs that affect dopamine activity.
@highlight Attention deficits were not noted in rats exposed to methylmercury during adolescence.
@highlight Exposed rats showed a subtle improvement in short term remembering consistent with other reports involving developmental.
