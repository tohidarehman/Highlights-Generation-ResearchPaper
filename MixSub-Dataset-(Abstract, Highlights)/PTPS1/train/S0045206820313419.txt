 A novel series of celecoxib derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for cyclooxygenase inhibitory activities for benefit in spinal cord injury . The title compounds were synthesized by conventional methods in good yields and subsequently tested for inhibitory activity against COX 1 COX 2 . The most potent COX 2 inhibitor among the tested derivatives was further assayed for protective effect against experimental SCI of Sprague Dawley rats . The designed compounds showed considerable inhibition of COX 2 as compared to COX 1 revealing compound
