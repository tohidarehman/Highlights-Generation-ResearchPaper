 Brain delivery of nanoparticles and macromolecular drugs depends on blood brain barrier permeable carriers . In this study we searched for cyclic heptapeptides facilitating BBB permeation of M13 phages by phage library screening using a transcellular permeability assay with hCMEC D3 cell monolayers a human BBB model . The M13 phage which is larger than macromolecular drugs and nanoparticles served as a model macromolecule . The screen identified cyclic heptapeptide SLSHSPQ as a human BBB permeable peptide . The SLS displaying phage exhibited improved permeation across the cell monolayer of monkey and rat BBB co culture models . The SLS phage internalized into hCMEC D3 cells

@highlight BBB permeable cyclic SLS heptapeptide was identified by phage library screening.
@highlight Cyclic SLS peptide facilitates BBB permeation of M13 phages and liposomes.
@highlight Internalization of cyclic SLS peptide is mediated by macropinocytosis.
@highlight Permeation of cyclic SLS peptide involves exosome secretion pathway.
