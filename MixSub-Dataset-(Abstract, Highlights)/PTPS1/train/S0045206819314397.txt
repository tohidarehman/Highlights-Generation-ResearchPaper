 In an effort for the development of novel antimicrobial agents ethylenic conjugated coumarin thiazolidinediones as potential multi targeting new antimicrobial compounds were synthesized through convenient procedures from commercially available resorcinol and were evaluated for their antimicrobial potency . Bioactive evaluation revealed that some of the prepared compounds showed strong antimicrobial activities towards the tested microorganisms including clinically drug resistant strains . Especially propargyl derivative

@highlight Novel ethylenic conjugated coumarin thiazolidinediones were synthesized.
@highlight All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity.
@highlight Compound
@highlight showed excellent inhibitory efficacy against MRSA and A.
@highlight Compound
@highlight with low toxicity did not trigger resistance development in bacteria.
@highlight could effectively permeabilize MRSA cell membrane and intercalate into DNA.
