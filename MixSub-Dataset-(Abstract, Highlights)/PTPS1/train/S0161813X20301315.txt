 Methamphetamine exposure reportedly promotes microglial activation and pro inflammatory cytokines secretion . Sustained inflammation in abusers of psychostimulant drugs further induces neural damage . Cholecystokinin 8 is a gut brain peptide which exerts a wide range of biological activities in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system . We previously found that pre treatment with CCK 8 inhibited behavioural and histologic changes typically induced by repeated exposure to METH . Here we aimed to estimate the effects of CCK 8 on METH induced neuro inflammation which is markedly characterized by microglia activation and increased pro inflammatory cytokines production

@highlight CCK 8 inhibited METH induced microglial activation and production of IL 6 and TNF .
@highlight CCK 8 attenuated METH induced activation of NF B signaling.
@highlight The effect of CCK 8 was dependent on the activation of the CCK2 receptor.
