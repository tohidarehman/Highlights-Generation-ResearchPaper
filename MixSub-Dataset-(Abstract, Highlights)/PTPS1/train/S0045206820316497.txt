 The prevalence of Alzheimers disease has become a substantial global concern . Approved AChE inhibitors have been used for symptomatic treatment of AD . Binding of amyloid to the peripheral anionic site of AChE facilitates the formation of A plaques . Blocking this proposed proteinprotein interaction by inhibition of the peripheral anionic site of AChE in addition to increasing the level of ACh reduces the A aggregation and might qualify to slow down the progression of disease besides the palliative treatment . Targeting proteinprotein interactions consider as one of the most challenging issues in the realm of drug design in which peptides have potentials to excel in . In the present study we applied two virtual fragment based and template based approaches to design peptidic inhibitors of the PAS of AChE . Based on the

@highlight approaches applied to design peptidic inhibitors of AChE.
@highlight Fragment based peptide design approach was more efficient than template based design.
@highlight WY dipeptide prevents cognitive impairment and was main component of the
