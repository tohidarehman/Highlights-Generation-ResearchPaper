 The elaboration of nanotechnology offers valuable therapeutic options to overcome the blood brain barrier and enable the treatment of brain diseases . However to date limit work has been done to reveal the fate of nanoparticles within the brain which largely hinders their safe and effective applications . Here we demonstrated that the commonly used organic nanoparticles reconstituted high density lipoprotein and poly b poly nanoparticles were cleared relatively fast from the brain . Notably through various transgenic mice and pharmacological inhibition approaches we revealed that the paravascular glymphatic pathway plays a key role in the brain clearance of the nanoparticles and disclosed that microglia mediated transportation is essential for facilitating nanoparticles elimination through the paravascular route . In addition we witnessed a significant decline in the brain clearance of both of the nanoparticles in Alzheimer s model mice where the glymphatic system is impaired . These findings provide insightful data on the fate of nanoparticles in the brain which would shed new light into the rational design and safe application of nanoparticles for brain drug delivery .
