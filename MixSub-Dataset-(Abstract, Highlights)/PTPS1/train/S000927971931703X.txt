 Excess weight and obesity increase the risk of developing major risk factors for chronic kidney disease . Lignin comprises 20 30 of the global plant biomass however it is not well utilized because of its resistance to chemical and biological degradation . We investigated whether low molecular weight oxidized lignophenol a lignin derivative could alter inflammation and fibrosis in the kidneys of a high fat diet fed mice . Male mice were divided into three treatment groups HFD HFD 0.3 LOLP and HFD 0.6 LOLP . The control mice were fed a low fat diet . Macrophage kinetics the degree of fibrosis the extent of phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase and mRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators in the kidneys were examined . The number of macrophages the percentage of fibrotic area and the mRNA expression of proinflammatory markers TNF and Ccl2 and a marker of fibrosis TGF were significantly higher in the kidneys of mice in the HFD group than those in the Cont group . Conversely treatment with 0.6 LOLP for 8 weeks significantly suppressed the degree of macrophage infiltration interstitial fibrotic area and the increased mRNA expression of proinflammatory and fibrosis markers induced by HFD . In conclusion LOLP suppressed macrophage infiltration and the increase in fibrotic area and upregulated AMPK phosphorylation in the kidneys of HFD fed mice thus it may ameliorate HFD induced kidney injury .
