 Carbon monoxide is an inorganic chemical compound that can bind with hemoglobin with highly toxic effects . In living organisms it is produced endogenously during the degradation of heme by oxygenase which occurs in three isoforms HO 1 HO 2 and HO 3 . CO can play an important role in the regulation of many physiological functions . Carbon Oxide Releasing Molecules are a novel group of chemical compounds capable of controlled CO release directly in tissues or organs . This release depends on concentration pH solvent type and temperature . The biological role and the therapeutic potential of different CORMs is not always well demonstrated . However this mini review summarizes the various function of these compounds .
