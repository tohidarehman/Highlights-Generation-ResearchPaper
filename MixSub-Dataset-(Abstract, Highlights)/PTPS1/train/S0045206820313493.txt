 Self assembly is a ubiquitous process of complex bio molecules to perform various biological functions . This bottom up approach applies in engineering of various nanostructures in different technological and biomedical applications . Here we report design and synthesis of phenolic acid conjugated tetra peptides which self assembled in uniform nanofibrils upon dissolution in aqueous solutions at physiological pH and formed stiff and transparent hydrogel . Gel inversion assay HR TEM FT IR CD spectroscopy and rheometric analysis characterized the developed hydrogel

@highlight  terminal conjugation of tetra peptides with phloretic acid promotes self assembly and hydrogelation.
@highlight Flexibility of phenol stacking plays a major role in self assembly of peptide.
@highlight Hydrogel was capable to entrap hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs for sustained release action.
@highlight The hydrogelator peptide 
@highlight  2 synergized antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin and rifampicin against MRSA.
