 Acrylamide is known to induce disorders in the central nervous system in humans and experimental animals . The present study investigated effects of exposure to acrylamide on adult neurogenesis noradrenergic axons and the level of norepinephrine in the brain of male rats . Four groups of 12 male Wistar rats each were exposed to acrylamide at 0 0.2 2 and 20 mg kg body weight by gavage for 5 weeks . Six rats of each groups were injected with 5 bromo 2 deoxy uridine after five week exposure to acrylamide to examine proliferative cells in the dentate gyrus using immunostaining . Density of noradrenergic and serotonergic axons in the prefrontal cortex hippocampus and cortex behind the bregma was quantified . Remaining 6 rats were decapitated after the last exposure and brains were dissected out to measure monoamine level in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex using high performance liquid chromatography . Exposure to acrylamide dose dependently decreased the density of noradrenergic axons in the prefrontal cortex with a significant change at 20 mg kg . Norepinephrine level decreased in the hippocampus at 20 mg kg . Exposure to acrylamide at 20 mg kg or less did not change the number of BrdU positive cells but the result should be considered preliminary . The results show that oral exposure to acrylamide induces decrease in noradrenergic axons and norepinephrine level in the brain of rats . Given the similar effects are observed in 1 bromopropane exposed rats there may be the common mechanism in the toxicity of soft electrophiles to the central nervous system .
