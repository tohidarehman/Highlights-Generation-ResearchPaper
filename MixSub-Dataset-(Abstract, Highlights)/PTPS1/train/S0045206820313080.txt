 Platinum drugs and new Pt agents behave the dysregulation of apoptosis as the result of DNA damage repair and thus are less effective in the treatment of resistant tumors . Herein mononitro naphthalimide Pt complex

@highlight Mononitro naphthalimide Pt IV complex
@highlight targeting DNA damage response
@highlight a dual DNA damage approach to overcome cisplatin resistance.
@highlight targets resistant cells in a totally different way from the existing Pt drugs.
@highlight The highest fold increase FI for A549cisR cells and the lowest for A549 indicated
@highlight preferentially accumulated in resistant cell lines.
