 In this study a series of A ring azepano and 3 amino 3 4 seco derivatives were synthesized from betulin oleanolic ursolic and glycyrrhetinic acids aiming to develop new cholinesterase inhibitors . Azepanobetulin azepanoerythrodiol and azepanouvaol were modified to give amide and tosyl derivatives while azepano anhydrobetulines and azepano glycyrrhetols were obtained for the first time . Oleanane and ursane type 3 amino 3 4 seco 4 en triterpenic alcohols were synthesized by reducing the corresponding 2 cyano derivatives accessible from Beckmann type 2 rearrangements . The compounds were screened in colorimetric Ellmans assays to determine their ability to act as inhibitors for the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase . While most of these compounds were only moderate inhibitors for AChE several of them were shown to be inhibitors for BChE acting as mixed type inhibitors . Azepanobetulin

@highlight A series of A ring azepano and 3 amino 3 4 seco triterpenoids has been synthesized.
