 A stereoselective method was developed for the synthesis of synthetic analogues of natural 5Z 9Z dienoic acids by esterification of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols and carboxylic acids with 1 14 tetradeca 5 9 dienedioic acid and 1 14 tetradeca 5 9 dienediol synthesized by Ti catalyzed homo cyclomagnesiation of the tetrahydropyran ether of hepta 5 6 dien 1 ol with Grignard reagents . In order to establish the effect of molecular structure on the antitumor activity the obtained 5Z 9Z dienoic acids were tested for the inhibitory activity against human topoisomerase I the cytotoxic activity

@highlight Series of new analogues of natural 5Z 9Z dienoic acids have been synthesized.
@highlight New molecules are efficient topoisomerase I inhibitors and apoptosis inducers in cancer cells.
@highlight Acids induce cell death via apoptosis and arresting cell cycle in the G1 S phase.
@highlight For new 5Z 9Z dienoic acids the structurebiological activity relationships have been elucidated.
@highlight The structures of all novel compounds were confirmed by NMR measurements.
