 Pesticide exposure is associated with cognitive and psychomotor disorders . Glyphosate based herbicides are among the most used agrochemicals and inhalation of GlyBH sprays may arise from frequent aerial pulverizations . Previously we described that intranasal administration of GlyBH in mice decreases locomotor activity increases anxiety and impairs recognition memory . Then the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in GlyBH neurotoxicity after IN administration . Adult male CF 1 mice were exposed to GlyBH IN administration . Total thiol content and the activity of the enzymes catalase acetylcholinesterase and transaminases were evaluated in different brain areas . In addition markers of the cholinergic and the nigrostriatal pathways as well as of astrocytes were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy in coronal brain sections . The brain areas chosen for analysis were those seen to be affected in our previous study . GlyBH IN administration impaired the redox balance of the brain and modified the activities of enzymes involved in cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways . Moreover GlyBH treatment decreased the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum as well as the expression of the 7 acetylcholine receptor in the hippocampus . Also the number of astrocytes increased in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the exposed mice . Taken together these disturbances may contribute to the neurobehavioural impairments reported previously by us after IN GlyBH administration in mice .
