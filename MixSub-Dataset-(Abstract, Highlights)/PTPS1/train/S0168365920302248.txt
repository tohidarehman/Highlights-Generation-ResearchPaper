 The accelerated blood clearance phenomenon caused in large degree via in vivo anti PEG IgM production is one of obstacles for development of PEGylated liposome and protein formulations due to decreased efficiency and or side effects such as anaphylaxis upon repeat administrations . We have shown in murine ABC models that splenectomy suppressed the level of anti PEG IgM production induced by PEGylated liposomes indicating that murine splenic B cells play an important role in its production . However splenectomy did not completely inhibit production of anti PEG IgM suggesting that other cells may contribute to its production in the ABC phenomenon . In this study we examined the contribution of hepatosplenic phagocytic cells to anti PEG IgM production and clearance of PEGylated liposomes during the ABC phenomenon . Depletion of hepatosplenic phagocytic cells by pretreatment of mice with clodronate containing non PEGylated liposomes suppressed anti PEG IgM production to a considerable degree without a change in the number of splenic B cells and attenuated the enhanced clearance of second dose of PEGylated liposomes . These results suggest that hepatosplenic phagocytic cells in addition to splenic B cells contribute to the production of anti PEG IgM and the ABC phenomenon against PEGylated liposomes . The mechanism whereby splenic B cells interact with hepatosplenic phagocytic cells to produce anti PEG IgM upon administration of an initial dose of PEGylated liposomes remains to be elucidated .
