 Cyclooxygenase is critical for maintaining physiological functions whereas overexpression of COX 2 was closely implicated in various cancers . In this study a series of novel aminophosphonate derivatives containing pyrazole moiety were synthesized with their anti cancer activity evaluated .

@highlight Providing a novel series of potential inhibitors for COX 2.
@highlight The series
@highlight were all reported for the first time.
@highlight The top hit
@highlight suggested potency and selectivity of inhibiting COX 2 and potency for human breast cancer cells.
@highlight induced apoptosis of MCF 7 cells through a mitochondrion dependent pathway and involved cell cycle arrest in G2 phase.
