 Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B is considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus since this enzyme plays a significant role to down regulate insulin and leptin signalling and its over expression has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance T2DM and obesity . Some thiazolidinediones derivatives have been reported as promising PTP1B inhibitors with anti hyperglycemic effects . Recently lobeglitazone a new TZD was described as an antidiabetic drug that targets the PPAR pathway but no information on its effects on PTP1B have been reported to date . We investigated the effects of lobeglitazone on PTP1B activity

@highlight The antidiabetic drug Lobeglitazone inhibits PTP1B phosphatase activity
@highlight Lobeglitazone has an IC
@highlight of 42.8M against PTP1B.
@highlight Lobeglitazone behaves as a reversible non competitive inhibitor.
