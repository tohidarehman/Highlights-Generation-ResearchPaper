 Natural protoberberine alkaloids were first identified and characterized as potent selective and cellular active lysine specific demethylase 1 inhibitors . Due to our study isoquinoline based tetracyclic scaffold was identified as the key structural element for their anti LSD1 activity subtle changes of substituents attached to the core structure led to dramatic changes of the activity . Among these protoberberine alkaloids epiberberine potently inhibited LSD1 IC

@highlight It is the first time to report tetracyclic protoberberine alkaloids as LSD1 inhibitors.
@highlight Epiberberine could inactive LSD1 in AML cell lines.
@highlight Epiberberine induces differentiation of AML cell lines.
@highlight Epiberberine prolongs survival of mice bearing THP 1 cells.
