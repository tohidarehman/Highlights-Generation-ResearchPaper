 The on going pandemic of COVID 19 wreaked by a viral infection of SARS CoV 2 has generated a catastrophic plight across the globe . Interestingly one of the hallmarks of COVID 19 is the so called cytokine storm due to attack of SARS Cov 2 in the lungs . Considering mesenchymal stem cells therapy could contribute against SARS CoV 2 viruses attack because of their immune modulatory and anti inflammatory ability linked to their stemness to the arsenal of treatments for COVID 19 . Another novel therapeutic strategies include the blockade of rampant generation of pro inflammatory mediators like acute respiratory distress syndrome degradation of viral protein capsids by PROTACs composed of Ubiquitin proteasome framework and ubiquitination independent pathway directing the SARS CoV 2 nucleocapsid protein and proteasome activator etc . This review is consequently an endeavour to highlight the several aspects of COVID 19 with incorporation of important treatment strategies discovered to date and putting the real effort on the future directions to put them into the perspective .

@highlight Coronavirus disease COVID 19 emerged out as a potential global biological disaster caused by SARS CoV 2
@highlight Early detection of the SARS CoV 2 had a better prognosis for treatment strategies.
@highlight Clinical trials among repurposed molecules had progressed with several methodological limitations.
@highlight Systemic overview of various aspects in epidemiology and treatment strategies.
@highlight Challenges and the future directions have also been discussed.
