 Glycogen phosphorylase is an important target for the development of new anti hyperglycaemic agents . Flavonoids are novel inhibitors of GP but their mode of action is unspecific in terms of the GP binding sites involved . Towards design of synthetic flavonoid analogues acting specifically at the inhibitor site and to exploit the sites hydrophobic pocket chrysin has been employed as a lead compound for the

@highlight Synthetic flavonoids synthesized based on QM MM PBSA binding free energy predictions.
