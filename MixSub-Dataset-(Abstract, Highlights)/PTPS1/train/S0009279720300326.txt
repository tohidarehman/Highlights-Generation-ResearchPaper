 Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist with efficacy against a variety of diseases including asthma and inflammation related conditions . However various neuropsychiatric events suspected to be related to montelukast have been reported recently with limited understanding on their association and underlying mechanisms . This study aimed to investigate whether montelukast can induce neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in microglial HAPI cells and neural SH SY5Y cells . The present study also compared the effects of montelukast with a 5 lipoxygenase inhibitor and a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor to better understand modulation of related pathways . HAPI or SH SY5Y cells were treated with the indicated drugs for 24h to investigate drug induced neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity . Montelukast induced cytotoxicity in HAPI cells accompanied with caspase 3 7 activation prostaglandin E

@highlight This study provides the first
@highlight evidence on Montelukast toxicity to microglial and neuronal cells.
@highlight Provides evidence that this toxicity may be mediated by inflammatory response.
@highlight Suggests that the inflammatory response and toxicity may contribute to neuropsychiatric events seen with montelukast use.
