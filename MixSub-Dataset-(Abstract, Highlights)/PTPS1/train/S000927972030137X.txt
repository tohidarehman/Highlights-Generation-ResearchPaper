 Apple polyphenols have attracted much attention due to their various bioactivities . In this study the protective effect of AP against chronic ethanol exposure induced neural injury as well as the possible mechanisms were investigated . Body weight daily average food intake and daily average fluid intake were measured and daily average ethanol consumption was calculated . The influences of AP on motor behavior and memory were detected by locomotor activity test rotarod test beam walking test and Y maze test and novel object recognition test respectively . The changes of blood ethanol concentration and the oxidative stress were also measured .

@highlight Apple polyphenols improved chronic ethanol exposure induced inhibition of body weight and daily average food intake.
@highlight Motor activity and motor coordination were not influenced after chronic ethanol exposure under our experimental protocol.
@highlight Apple polyphenols improved chronic ethanol induced memory impairments in the Y maze test and novel object recognition test.
@highlight Apple polyphenols improved chronic ethanol induced morphological damage to hippocampal CA1 neurons.
@highlight Memory impairmentsameliorated by apple polyphenols were associated with inhibition of oxidative stress and activation of antioxidant defense systems.
