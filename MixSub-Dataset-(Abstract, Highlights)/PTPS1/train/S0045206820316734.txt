 Advanced glycation end products are implicated to be the key players in most of the diabetic complications . The AGEs interfere with the proteins heterogeneously thereby rendering denaturation and the consequent loss of function and accumulation . Thus a novel natural product inspired indeno 2 1

@highlight Natural product inspired synthesis of indeno 2 1 
@highlight  pyridinones.
@highlight Three compounds 4i 4x and 4aa displayed promising antiglycation potential.
@highlight 4aa showed better AGE trapping efficacy than the positive control aminoguanidine.
@highlight The in vitro toxicity evaluations performed on L6 rat skeletal muscle cell lines.
@highlight First study for direct screening of a large number of NCEs and natural products.
