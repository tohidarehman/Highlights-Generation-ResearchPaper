 Acetylcholinesterase terminates cholinergic neurotransmission by hydrolyzing acetylcholine . The collagen tailed AChE tetramer is a product of 2 genes ACHE and ColQ . The AChE tetramer consists of 4 identical AChE subunits and one polyproline rich peptide whose function is to hold the 4 AChE subunits together . Our goal was to determine the amino acid sequence of the polyproline rich peptide in

@highlight Trypsin digestion converted collagen tailed AChE to soluble AChE tetramers.
@highlight Trypsin shortened the collagen tail leaving only polyproline rich peptides.
@highlight AChE assembles into tetramers by interaction with a polyproline rich peptide.
@highlight Mass spectrometry identified the polyproline rich peptides in TcAChE tetramers.
