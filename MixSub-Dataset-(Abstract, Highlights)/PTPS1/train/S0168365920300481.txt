 The local microenvironment may influence the success of stem cell therapy . Iron overload occurs in many hemorrhagic injuries due to hemolysis and hemoglobin degradation which not only mediates local cell injury but also induces damage to the transplanted cells . Here an injectable nanoparticle encapsulated core shell hydrogel was fabricated for simultaneous iron overload clearance and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells transplantation following intracerebral hemorrhage . The iron chelator loaded low molecular weight keratin hydrogel with quick degradation property was selected as the outer shell to eliminate iron overload and BMSCs implantation with high molecular weight keratin hydrogel was selected as the inner core . The epidermal growth factor and the basic fibroblast growth factor were entrapped within the poly lactic

@highlight Core shell hydrogel used for iron overload clearance and BMSCs transplantation.
@highlight More BMSCs survived in core shell hydrogel compared to that in core hydrogel.
@highlight Faster neurological recovery were observed after core shell hydrogel treatment.
