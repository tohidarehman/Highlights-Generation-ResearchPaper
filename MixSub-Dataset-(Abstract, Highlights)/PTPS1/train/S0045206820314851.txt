 The lysophospholipase D autotaxin generates lysophosphatidic acid that activates six cognate G protein coupled receptors in cancerous cells promoting their motility and invasion . Four novel compounds were generated aided by molecular docking guided design and synthesis techniques to obtain new dual inhibitors of ATX and the lysophosphatidic acid receptor subtype 1 . Biological evaluation of these compounds revealed two compounds

@highlight Four different potential autotaxin ATX inhibitors were synthesized.
@highlight These ATX inhibitors are non lipid small molecules.
@highlight These ATX Inhibitors have no carboxylic acid or its bioisosteric moieties.
@highlight Tetrahydropyran based compounds showed promising activity against ATX.
@highlight Molecular docking predicted potential binding in the hydrophobic pocket of the ATX.
@highlight QSAR modeling showed a good correlation with the experimental findings.
