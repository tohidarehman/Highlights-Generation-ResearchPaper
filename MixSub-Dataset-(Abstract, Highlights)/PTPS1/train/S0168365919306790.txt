 Sustained antigen and adjuvant availability have been shown to improve antiviral immune responses following vaccination . Transcutaneous delivery of vaccines using microneedles has also shown promise and may be particularly relevant for mosquito borne viruses . We aim to combine these traits to create a three component Protein Subunit vaccine on Microneedle Arrays for transcutaneous delivery using layer by layer assembly . Polymer multilayer thin films were generated to co deliver a model combination of three chemically distinct vaccine components a dengue virus Envelope protein Domain III subunit antigen and two adjuvants a double stranded RNA and an amphiphilic hexapeptide Pam3CSK4 . Following application of PSMNs to the skin implanted thin films facilitated sustained and temporal release of individual vaccine components from polymer multilayers . By modulating LbL composition and architecture component release profiles in the skin could be independently tuned to allow release of adjuvants and antigen from days up to two weeks . Uptake of antigen and adjuvant from implanted vaccine films by antigen presenting cells was demonstrated using in vivo mouse and ex vivo human skin models . Overall we believe that such modular vaccine strategies offer design principles for enhancing the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines .
