 Deoxyuridine triphosphate derivatives modified at the C5 position of the pyrimidine ring with various aromatic hydrocarbon substituents of different hydrophilicities have been synthesized . The aromatic hydrocarbon substituents were attached to dUTPs via a CH

@highlight Seven dUTPs modified with aromatic hydrocarbon substituents were synthesized.
@highlight Modified dUMPs were PCR incorporated using Taq Tth Vent exo and Deep Vent exo 
@highlight The yield of PCR depended on the hydrophilicity of the substituent at C5 of the dUMPs.
@highlight PCR amplified DNA strands contained up to three adjacent modified dUMPs.
