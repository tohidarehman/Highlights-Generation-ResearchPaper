 Molecules capable of engaging with multiple targets associated with pathological condition of Alzheimer s disease have proved to be potential anti Alzheimer s agents . In our goal to develop multitarget directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimers disease a novel series of carbazole based stilbene derivatives were designed by the fusion of carbazole ring with stilbene scaffold . The designed compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their anti AD activities including cholinesterase inhibition A aggregation inhibition antioxidant and metal chelation properties . Amongst them

@highlight A series of carbazole stilbene hybrids were synthesized as anti AD agents.
@highlight Compound 
@highlight  exhibited good inhibitory activities against AChE and BuChE.
@highlight Compound 
@highlight  showed notable inhibition of self mediated A
@highlight aggregation.
@highlight It also possessed specific copper ion chelation property.
