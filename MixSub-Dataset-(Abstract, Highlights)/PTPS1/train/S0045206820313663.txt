 Cationic molecules are found in abundance as antimicrobial agents with a well defined mechanism of action and significant therapeutic benefits . Quaternary ammonium containing compounds are frequently employed due to their facile synthesis and tunable properties . Over time however bacterial resistance to these compounds has become a significant obstacle . We report here a series of asymmetric trisalkylamine cyclopropenium cationic derivatives as chemical isosteres of quaternary ammonium compounds capable of strong antimicrobial activity and overcoming microbial resistance . These small molecules were prepared by one pot reaction of tetrachlorocyclopropene with unhindered secondary amines in the presence of Hnigs base . In this work we describe the synthesis purification and characterization of five trisamino cyclopropenium derivatives and confirm their structures by spectral analysis and mass spectrometry . Three of the compounds displayed considerable antimalarial activity IC
