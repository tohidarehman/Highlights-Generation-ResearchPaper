 Indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase 1 plays a vital role in tumor immune escape and has emerged as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy . In this study a novel series of bicyclic carboxylic acid derivatives were designed synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory activities against IDO1 . Among these compound

@highlight Twenty six bicyclic carboxylic acid derivatives were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Molecular docking studies were performed.
@highlight IDO1 inhibitory activities were evaluated by HeLa and THP 1 cellular assay.
@highlight The compound
@highlight  HeLa IC50 2.6nM THP 1 IC
@highlight  11.2nM inhibited tumor growth of CT26 model effectively.
