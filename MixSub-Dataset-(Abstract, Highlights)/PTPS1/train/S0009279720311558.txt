 The unfolded protein response is an emerging target pathway for cancer treatment owing to its ability to induce cell death . In our previous analysis of UPR modulating small molecules we had reported that piperazine oxalate derivative compounds are able to promote increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha . In this study we found that AMC 04 induces apoptotic cell death

@highlight A new piperazine oxalate derivate AMC 04 induces apoptosis in human cancer cells.
@highlight AMC 04 induces apoptosis
@highlight the activation of the ATF4 CHOP DR5 pathway.
@highlight Induction of DR5 by AMC 04 is regulated by ROS mediated p38 activation.
@highlight AMC 04 can bind to the histone methyltransferases revealed by molecular docking analysis.
@highlight AMC 04 inhibits the H3K9 histone methyltransferase activity revealed by biochemical analysis.
