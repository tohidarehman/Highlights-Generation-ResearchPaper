 Alzheimer s disease the most common form of dementia is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal atrophy in various brain regions . The expression of miR 107 is down regulated in AD patients and target genes of miR 107 have been shown to directly involved in AD . In this study we aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of miR 107 . We first assessed brain activity in health controls and patients with AD . Then we examined miR 107 expression in SH SY5Y and PC12cells treated with 6 hydroxydopamine and investigated its function in cytotoxicity induced by 6 OHDA . We predicted a potential miR 107 target and assessed its role in miR 107 mediated effects and explored the intracellular signaling pathways downstream of miR 107 . Finally we assessed the function of miR 107 in the mouse model insulted by 6 OHDA . We found that 6 OHDA suppressed miR 107 expression and miR 107 played neuroprotective effects against 6 OHDA mediated cytotoxicity . We showed that miR 107 targeted programmed cell death 10 . MiR 107 suppressed PDCD10 expression and exogenous expression of PDCD10 inhibited miR 107 mediated neuroprotection . Additionally we found that Notch signal pathway was downstream of miR 107 PDCD10 . Finally we found that 6 OHDA treatment suppressed miR 107 in mice and restoration of miR 107 alleviated motor disorder in the mouse model . Our study shows that miR 107 plays important neuroprotective roles against neurotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting PDCD10 . Our findings confirm that miR 107 may be involved in AD pathogenesis and may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD related impairments .
