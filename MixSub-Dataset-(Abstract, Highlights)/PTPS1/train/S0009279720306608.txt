 This study investigated the enantioselective metabolism of benoxacor an ingredient of herbicide formulations in microsomes or cytosol prepared from female or male rat livers . Benoxacor was incubated for 30min with microsomes or cytosol and its enantioselective depletion was measured using gas chromatographic methods . Benoxacor was depleted in incubations with active microsomes in the presence and absence of NADPH suggesting its metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and microsomal carboxylesterases . Benoxacor was depleted in cytosolic incubations in the presence of glutathione consistent with its metabolism by glutathione S transferases . The depletion of benoxacor was faster in incubations with cytosol from male than female rats whereas no statistically significant sex differences were observed in microsomal incubations . The consumption of benoxacor was inhibited by the CYP inhibitor 1 aminobenzotriazole the CES inhibitor benzil and the GST inhibitor ethacrynic acid . Estimates of the intrinsic clearance of benoxacor suggest that CYPs are the primary metabolic enzyme responsible for benoxacor metabolism in rats . Microsomal incubations showed an enrichment of the first eluting benoxacor enantiomer E
