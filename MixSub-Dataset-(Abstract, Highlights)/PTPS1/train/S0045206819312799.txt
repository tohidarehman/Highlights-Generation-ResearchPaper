 With plenteous accessible therapeutics lung cancer endures a preeminent cause of the worldwide fatality . Apart from medical advancements various plant parts are still used to treat cancer based on proven tradition . The present study focuses on analysing the anticancer efficacy of silver nanoparticles coupled with the aqueous leaf extract of

@highlight We performed green synthesis of silver nanoparticles from
@highlight leaf extract.
@highlight Nanoparticles were found to have well defined shape and structure with size uniformity and desired functional groups.
@highlight Dose dependent antiproliferative activity of silver nanoparticles were observed.
@highlight Anticancer activity of silver nanoparticles was studied at molecular level.
@highlight The silver nanoparticles would be a potent anticancer agent.
