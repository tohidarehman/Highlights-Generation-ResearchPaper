 Fungal infections have become a serious medical problem due to the high infection rate and the frequent emergence of drug resistance . Ergosterol is an important structural component of the fungal cell membrane its synthetases and 14 demethylase are considered as the key points to block the ergosterol synthesis . In this study we designed a series of dual target arylamides derivatives based on the analysis of active sites . Subsequently these target compounds were synthesized and their antifungal activity was evaluated . Most of compounds demonstrate the potent antifungal activity against multiple
