 Multi arm star poly polymers have a number of advantages over linear PEG polymers when used as carriers for drug delivery and controlled release . For instance they have more terminals that can be modified to form multi functional delivery systems with significantly increased drug loading . They can form micelles with higher stability and lower critical micelle concentration which helps to improve the blood circulation and reduce the unfavorable burst drug release . Moreover star PEG polymers can form three dimensional hydrogels with controllable size and adjustable functions through cross linking . Indeed these unique advantages of star PEG polymers have promoted investigations on star PEG based drug delivery systems . Herein for the first time we carefully reviewed the advances on the research and development of star PEG polymers especially the 4 6 and 8 armed star PEG polymers in delivery and controlled release of a series of bioactive agents including both small molecules and biomacromolecules . Opportunities and challenges for successful translation of star PEG based drug formulations into clinical use were also discussed .
