 6 Aminopyridin 3 ol scaffold has shown an excellent anti inflammatory bowel disease activity . Various analogues with the scaffold were synthesized in pursuit of the diversity of side chains tethering on the C position . Structure activity relationship among the analogues was investigated to understand the effects of the side chains and their linkers on their anti inflammatory activities . In this study structural modification moved beyond side chains on the C position and reached to pyridine ring itself . It expedited us to synthesize diverse ring modified analogues of a representative pyridine 3 ol 6 acetamido 2 4 5 trimethylpyridin 3 ol

@highlight Ring modified analogues of 6 acetamido 2 4 5 trimethylpyridin 3 ol were synthesized.
@highlight Structure activity relationship of the ring modified analogues were established.
@highlight Compound 17 inhibited TNF induced responses in colonic epithelial cells better than tofacitinib.
@highlight Anti colitis efficacy of compound 17 was much greater than tofacitinib in mice.
