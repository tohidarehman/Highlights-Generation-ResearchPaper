Increased activity of xanthine oxidase exerts both inflammatory and oxidative effects and has been implicated in metabolic derangements including non alcoholic fatty liver disease .

In the present study we evaluated the preventive effects of a SCFA acetate on nicotine induced dysmetabolism and fatty liver . Twenty four male Wistar rats vehicle treatment
