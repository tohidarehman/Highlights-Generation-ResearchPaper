 Topical treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis with corticosteroids suffers from challenges that include reduced drug bioavailability at the desired site of action . The retention of therapeutics within the epidermis can safely treat skin inflammation scaling and erythema associated with psoriasis while avoiding possible side effects associated with systemic treatments . We successfully synthesized and characterized a pH responsive biodegradable poly L glutamic acid fluocinolone acetonide conjugate that allows the controlled release of the FLUO to reduce skin inflammation . Additionally the application of a hyaluronic acid poly L glutamate cross polymer vehicle boosted skin permeation . During

@highlight Rationally designed polypeptide based conjugates for topical delivery.
@highlight Increased anti inflammatory activity after corticosteroid conjugation using bioresponsive polymer drug linkers.
@highlight Improved skin penetration using a hyaluronic acid polyglutamic acid cross polymer as vehicle.
@highlight Synergistic combination of drug conjugation and penetration enhancer provides an elevated reduction in inflammation
@highlight This strategy represents a possible palliative treatment for inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis.
