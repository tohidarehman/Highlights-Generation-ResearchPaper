 Prenatal ethanol exposure affects brain development and causes neural impairment leading to both cognitive and behavioral consequences in the offspring . Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to small amounts of alcohol on social play behavior in adolescent male offspring . Swiss mice were prenatally exposed to ethanol by feeding pregnant dams with a liquid diet containing 25 alcohol derived calories during gestation . They were then compared to both pair fed dams that received an isocaloric liquid diet containing 0 alcohol derived calories and dams with ad libitum access to a liquid control diet . Additionally maternal behavior was evaluated in terms of neural activation indexed via c fos expression in the prefrontal cortex . Although dams exposed to alcohol during pregnancy did not alter their maternal behavior the offspring presented a decrease in their social play behavior compared with both control and pair fed offspring . The decrease in social play behavior may be associated with a decrease in number of c fos positive cells in the prefrontal cortex . The exposure to small amounts of alcohol during intrauterine development causes both a deficit in social play behavior and a reduction in the neuronal activity seen in the prefrontal cortex .
