 Advanced glycation end products which instigate many disorders are mostly mediated by dicarbonyl rearrangements . We studied the corresponding mechanisms of the anti glycation effects of two anthocyanins purified from mulberry fruits namely cyanidin 3 glucoside and cyanidin 3 rutinoside on glycated lactoglobulins . Both mulberry anthocyanins inhibited the AGEs formation in a dose dependent manner but the effect of C3R was significantly stronger than that of C3G . MAs inhibited AGEs formation by selectively trapping dicarbonyls especially glyoxal . The UPLC ESI Q TOF MS results characterized that C3R formed mono and di glyoxal adducts where C3G only created di glyoxal adducts . Additionally C3R could directly interact with some of the glycation sites of Lg . Overall GO trapping and Lg MAs covalent noncovalent binding are disclosed as the key mechanisms of the anti AGEs activity of MAs on Lg which could be valorised as effectual AGEs inhibitors in proteins rich matrices .

@highlight Mulberry anthocyanins shielded lactoglobulin against glycation through different mechanisms.
@highlight Mulberry anthocyanins dose dependently mitigated creation of advanced glycation end products.
@highlight Mulberry anthocyanins trapped glyoxal more than methylglyoxal and formed some glyoxal adducts.
@highlight Mulberry anthocyanins declined protein glucose binding and structurally blocked lysyl sites.
@highlight Mulberry anthocyanins could be beneficially valorised as functional antiglycation ingredients.
