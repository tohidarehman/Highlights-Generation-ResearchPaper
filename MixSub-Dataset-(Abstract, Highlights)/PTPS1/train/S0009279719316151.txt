 The transmission of T 2 toxin and its metabolites into the edible tissues of poultry has potential effects on human health . The bile acid and xenobiotic system composes an intricate physiological network of chemoprotective and transporter related functions which ensures the detoxification and removal of harmful xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds from the body . This study revealed that cholic acid as one of the bile acids promoted the metabolism of T 2 toxin
