 We previously demonstrated that the cockroach bungarotoxin sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChR1 and nAChR2 subtypes are differently sensitive to intracellular calcium pathways . Here using whole cell patch clamp recordings we studied the effects of the diacylglycerol analogue 1 2 dioctanoyl

@highlight DiC8 reduces nicotine and clothianidin induced currents.
@highlight DiC8 reduces the increase in nicotine induced currents brought about by caffeine or Ca
@highlight DiC8 does not affect the decrease in nicotine induced currents induced by BAPTA.
@highlight Co application of both DiC8 with Ca
@highlight  caffeine or BAPTA reduced clothianidin currents.
