 In order to develop multitarget directed ligands as potential treatments for Alzheimers disease twenty eight new tacrine hydroxamate derivatives were designed synthesized and biologically evaluated . As expected most of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities against cholinesterases and histone deacetylase . Among the tested compounds

@highlight Twenty eight derivatives were designed synthesized and biologically evaluated.
@highlight Some compounds were found to potently inhibit both AChE and HDAC.
@highlight Compounds exhibited potential Cu
@highlight chelating properties and HDAC isoform inhibition selectivity.
@highlight Compound A10 could serve as apromising candidate analogs as AD therapeutics.
