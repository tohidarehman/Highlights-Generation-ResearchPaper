 Here we report rationally engineered peptide targeted liposomal doxorubicin nanoparticles that have an enhanced selectivity for HER2 positive breast tumor cells with high purity reproducibility and precision in controlling stoichiometry of targeting peptides . To increase HER2 positive tumor cell selective drug delivery we optimized the two most important design parameters peptide density and linker length

@highlight Optimized targeted nanoparticles have HER2 cell selectivity
@highlight and
@highlight Engineered nanoparticles achieve enhanced tumor accumulation through avidity.
@highlight Nanoparticle with optimal linker size achieves enhanced
@highlight tumor cell uptake.
@highlight Optimized formulation improves
@highlight anti tumor efficacy and minimizes toxicity.
