 Type 2 diabetes is associated with oxidative stress and low grade inflammation resulting in endothelial dysfunction . This study determined to explore the protective effects of berry derived anthocyanins with potent antioxidant and anti inflammatory activities in human diabetic endothelial cells upon oxidative and inflammatory stressors . Cultured healthy human aortic endothelial cells and diabetic human aortic endothelial cells exposed to oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide H

@highlight T2DM is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation resulting in ED.
@highlight Anthocyanins AC decreased H
@highlight  induced cytotoxicity in both HAEC D HAEC.
@highlight AC reduced LPSinduced IL6 production in the diabetic endothelial cell line.
@highlight AC treatment inhibited LPSinduced caspase 1 activation in D HEAC.
@highlight AC protected D HAECs via anti inflammatory mechanisms to prevent diabetic ED.
