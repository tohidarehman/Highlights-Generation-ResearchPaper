 Colchicine belongs to a large group of microtubule polymerization inhibitors . Although the anti cancer activity of colchicine and its derivatives has been established none of them has found commercial application in cancer treatment due to side effects . Therefore we designed and synthesized a series of six triple modified 4 chlorothiocolchicine analogues with amide moieties and one urea derivative . These novel derivatives were tested against several different cancer cell lines and primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and they showed activity in the nanomolar range . The obtained IC

@highlight Novel triple modified colchicine derivatives were designed and synthesized as anti cancer agents.
@highlight Some of compounds were active in the nanomolar range against cancer cell lines.
@highlight The antiproliferative activity results were validated with molecular docking simulation study with the tubulin.
