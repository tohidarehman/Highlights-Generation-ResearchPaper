 A new series of furan embelin derivatives was synthesized and characterized as ATP competitive CK2 inhibitors . The new compounds were efficiently synthesized using a multicomponent approach from embelin

@highlight A series of furan embelin derivatives were designed and synthesized as CK2 inhibitors through a multicomponent reaction.
@highlight Some compounds inhibited CK2 activity at the submicromolar range.
@highlight The binding pattern was analysed by docking and ATP competitive assay.
