 Phytoestrogens are plant derived substances with a similar structure to 17 beta estradiol which have protective roles in estrogen dependent diseases . Isoflavones the most well known subgroup of phytoestrogens play protective roles against chemicals induced liver injuries through several molecular mechanisms . Hepatoprotective effects of isoflavones are partly associated with their antioxidant anti inflammatory immunomodulatory and anti fibrotic properties . Besides isoflavones can reduce gut derived endotoxins accelerate alcohol metabolism stimulate detoxification of hepatotoxic chemicals suppress the bioactivation of these chemicals inhibit hepatocytes apoptosis and restore autophagy activity during chemicals induced liver diseases . This review provides a summary of the molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatoprotective effects of isoflavones . It seems that further studies are needed to investigate the hepatoprotective potential of isoflavones in patients with different stages of chemicals induced liver injuries .
