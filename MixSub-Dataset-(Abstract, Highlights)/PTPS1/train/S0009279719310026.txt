 To investigate the molecular structural and functional impact of aerosols from candidate modified risk tobacco products the Carbon Heated Tobacco Product 1.2 and Tobacco Heating System 2.2 compared with that of mainstream cigarette smoke on the cardiovascular system of ApoE Female ApoE Continuous exposure to cMRTP aerosols did not affect atherosclerosis progression heart function left ventricular structure or the cardiovascular transcriptome . Exposure to 3R4F CS triggered atherosclerosis progression reduced systolic ejection fraction and fractional shortening caused heart LV hypertrophy and initiated significant dysregulation in the transcriptomes of the heart ventricle and thoracic aorta . Importantly the structural functional and molecular changes caused by 3R4F CS were improved in the smoking cessation and switching groups . Exposure to cMRTP aerosols lacked most of the CS exposure related functional structural and molecular effects . Smoking cessation or switching to CHTP 1.2 aerosol caused similar recovery from the 3R4F CS effects in the ApoE

@highlight cMRTP aerosols induce less atherosclerotic plaque formation than CS.
@highlight cMRTP aerosols induce lower molecular changes in the aorta and heart tissues than CS.
@highlight Smoking cessation reverses gene expression changes in the heart ventricle and aorta.
