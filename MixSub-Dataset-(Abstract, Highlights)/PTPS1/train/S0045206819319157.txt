 With respect to the main role of amyloid plaques as one of the pathological hallmarks in the brain of Alzheimers patients the development of new imaging probes for targeted detection of A plaques has attracted considerable interests . In this study a novel cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl Technetium 99m

@highlight Peptide targeting A plaques was successfully synthesized.
@highlight Peptide radiolabeling was done by cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl
@highlight Tc precursor.
@highlight Biodistribution and imaging studies were done on Alzheimer s and normal rat models.
@highlight Autoradiography studies were applied on Alzheimer s and normal human brain sections.
@highlight Tc peptide could be a potential SPECT imaging agent for early detection of A.
