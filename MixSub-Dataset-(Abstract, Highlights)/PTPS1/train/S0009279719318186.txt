 High dietary iron intake is a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer . However how iron subsequently impacts the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells remains unclear . This study determined the expression of six iron regulatory genes in twenty one human colorectal cancer biopsies and matched normal colonic tissue . The results show that only

@highlight Colorectal cancer biopsies showed dysregulated iron metabolism gene expression.
@highlight Iron depletion or loading affected colorectal cancer cell growth.
@highlight The response to iron loading or depletion was cell type specific.
