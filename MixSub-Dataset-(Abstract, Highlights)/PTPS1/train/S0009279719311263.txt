 Cytochrome P450 2E1 is the major P450 enzyme involved in ethanol metabolism . That role is shared with two other enzymes that oxidize ethanol alcohol dehydrogenase and catalase . P450 2E1 is also involved in the bioactivation of a number of low molecular weight cancer suspects as validated

@highlight P450 2E1 contributes to ethanol metabolism.
@highlight P450 2E1 also has a role in the oxidation of some drugs and chemical carcinogens.
@highlight P450 2E1 does not cause global oxidative stress but it can be local.
@highlight The kinetic mechanism is unusual and leads to some apparent anomalies.
@highlight Single nucleotide variations exist but have not been implicated in diseases much.
