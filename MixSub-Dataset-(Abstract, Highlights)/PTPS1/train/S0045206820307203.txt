 Phototriggered drug delivery systems facilitate controlled delivery of drugs loaded on photoactive platform to the target region under light stimulation . The present study investigated the synthesis and efficacy of carbazolecoumarin fused heterocycles as a PTDDS platform for the photocontrolled release of a chemotherapeutic agent chlorambucil in an in vitro model of human breast and leukemia cancer cells . CC fused heterocycles were constructed using 4 hydroxycarbazole as the starting material and further modification of these heterocycles yielded two CC derivatives . CC 7 with an additionalCOOH group and CC 8 with the triphenylphosphonium group a mitochondria targeting ligand introduced in the carbazole ring dissolved in polar solvents and exhibited emission bands at 360 and 450nm respectively . The results indicate that visible light of 405nm triggers the photolysis of the CCdrug conjugate and efficiently delivers the drug in both in vitro cancer cell models . Cytotoxicity evaluation indicates the suppression of proliferation of both types of cells treated with CC 8 under synergy effect combining drug potency and photosensitization . Further the lower IC
