 Discovering small molecules with protein disaggregation effects is recently needed . For the first time we intensely studied the anti amyloidogenic effects of 3 structurally different phytosterols namely stigmasterol sitosterol and oryzanol on bovine serum albumin under aggregations promoting conditions using multispectral microstructure and molecular docking methods . Results found that PS dose and structure dependently inhibited BSA aggregations under the glycation conditions through separating BSA peak size quenching Tryptophan intensity altering BSA hydrophobicity and microstructural declining the aggregates of glycated BSA . Throughout the underlying mechanism beyond its disaggregation effects PS reformed cross sheet structure SDS PAGE bands and XRD peaks of glycated BSA aggregates . Most importantly PS were found to bind with some lysyl and arginine glycation sites of BSA specifically Lys114 Lys116 Lys136 Lys431 Arg427 and Arg185 via Hydrogen bonding with their OH groups and pi pi interactions of their steroid core . Taken together the current results unleash that PS could restrict BSA aggregations under the glycation conditions and their subsequent changes which can assist in the design of reasonable therapeutics .

@highlight The disaggregation effects of 3 structurally different PS on glycated BSA were studied.
@highlight PS dose dependently and structurally disaggregated BSA under the glycation conditions.
@highlight PS altered the secondary structures particles size and spectra of glycated BSA aggregates.
@highlight PS interacted with some of the lysyl and arginine glycation sites of BSA.
@highlight  oryzanol highly inhibited the glycation reactions since their unique structure.
