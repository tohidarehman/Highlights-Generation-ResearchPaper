 Occupational studies have shown an association between elevated Mn exposure and depressive symptoms . Blood Mn naturally rises during pregnancy due to mobilization from tissues suggesting it could contribute to pregnancy and postpartum depressive symptoms . To assess the association between BMn levels during pregnancy and postpartum depression creating opportunities for possible future interventions . We studied 561 women from the reproductive longitudinal Programming Research in Obesity Growth Environment and Social Stressors cohort in Mexico City . BMn was measured at the 2 The meanstandard deviation EPDS score at 12 months postpartum was 6.515.65 and 17.11 of women met the criteria for possible PPD . In adjusted models BMn during the 3 Our results demonstrate that elevated BMn levels during pregnancy predict PPD symptoms and could be a potential pathway for intervention and prevention of PPD .

@highlight Elevated blood manganese levels during mid to late pregnancy are associated with postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers.
@highlight Manganese is a nutrient critical to brain function but a toxicant at high levels that can promote oxidative stress.
@highlight This study suggests that dysregulation of the normal rise in blood manganese during pregnancy predicts depressive symptoms.
@highlight Modifiable factors that affect blood manganese levels may be targets to prevent postpartum depressive symptoms.
