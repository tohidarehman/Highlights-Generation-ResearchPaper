 A series of novel scutellarin methyl ester 4 dipeptide conjugates exhibiting active transport characteristics and protection against pathological damage caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy were successfully designed and synthesized . The physiochemical properties of the obtained compounds as well as the Caco 2 cell based permeability and uptake into hPepT1 MDCK cells were evaluated using various analytical methods . Scutellarin methyl ester 4 Val homo Leu dipeptide

@highlight Scutellarin methyl ester 4 dipeptide conjugates were synthesized and evaluated as potential protective agents against HIE.
@highlight exhibit the highest P
@highlight  lowest ER value in Caco 2 cells and the highest uptake value in hPepT1 MDCK cells.
@highlight exhibit more potent protective activity against oxidative damage by improving the relevant detection indicators.
@highlight has significantly therapeutic effect on HIE rat pups by reducing infarct area and APP BACE 1 expression.
@highlight Favorable pharmacokinetic profiles of
@highlight were also confirmed in our studies.
