 Several preclinical evidence indicate that the modulation of the endocannabinoid system represents a promising therapeutic approach for different diseases . However only few modulators of this system have reached so far an advanced stage of clinical development mainly due to limited efficacy and CB1 receptor dependent side effects . Those limitations might be overcome by multi target compounds that exert pro cannabinoid activities through the modulation of two or more targets in the ECS . This approach can offer a safer and more effective pharmacological strategy as compared to the modulation of a single target . In this work we report the synthesis and biological characterization of new 6 aryl 1 2 dihydro 2 oxo pyridine 3 carboxamide derivatives . Our results identified several compounds exhibiting interesting multi target profiles within the ECS . In particular compound

@highlight We synthesized 6 aryl 1 2 dihydro 2 oxo pyridine 3 carboxamide derivatives.
@highlight Some derivatives showed interesting multi target profiles within the ECS.
@highlight Molecular docking on 3D structures of CBRs and of FAAH suggested their binding mode.
