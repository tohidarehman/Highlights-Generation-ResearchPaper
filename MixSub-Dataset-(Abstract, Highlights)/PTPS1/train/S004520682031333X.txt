 Oleanolic acid and its semi synthetic derivatives have been reported to have a wide range of biological activities . The introduction of electrophilic Michael acceptor group can increase the reactivity of OA to cellular targets and thus improve the anti tumor activity . In this work a series of novel unsaturated carbonyl derivatives of OA were designed and synthesized . Their

@highlight 21 oleanolic acid derivatives containing unsaturated carbonyl were synthesized.
@highlight Most synthesized compounds exhibited potent
@highlight antiproliferative activities.
@highlight Compound
@highlight displayed the most potent inhibitory activity in MCF 7 cells.
@highlight Compound
@highlight inhibited the cells migration and arrested cell cycle at S phase.
@highlight Compound
@highlight inhibited PI3K AKT mTOR signaling pathway in MCF 7 cells.
