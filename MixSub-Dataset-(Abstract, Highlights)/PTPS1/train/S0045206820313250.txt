 A new series of pyrimidine derivatives containing aryl urea moieties was designed and synthesized . The anticancer activities of all compounds were evaluated

@highlight New pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for anticancer activity.
@highlight showed the best cytotoxic activity against SW480 with IC
@highlight value of 11.08 M.
@highlight arrested cell cycle at G2 M phase and induced apoptosis in SW480 cells.
@highlight Treating SW480 cells with
@highlight induced the expression of Bax Ikb and cleaved PARP.
@highlight Also 
@highlight induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in SW480 cells.
