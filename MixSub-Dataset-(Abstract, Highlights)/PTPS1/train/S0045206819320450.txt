 Implication of carbonic anhydrases in many physiological functions made them attractive therapeutic targets . Herein we report the synthesis of three series of benzenesulfonamide based compounds

@highlight Three series of benzenesulfonamide based compounds were prepared.
@highlight All compounds were screened for CA inhibition against CA I II IX and XII isoforms.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight preferentially inhibited the tumor associated isoforms IX and XII.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight were the highest in potency against hCA XII.
@highlight Molecular docking of
@highlight in the active sites of four CA isoforms confirmed its activity.
