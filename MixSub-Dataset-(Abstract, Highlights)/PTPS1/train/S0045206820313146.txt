 Diaryl disulfides and diaryl thiosulfonates were synthesized with the two phenyl rings of all compounds bearing identical halide substituents . Because of structural similarity to the potent antimitotic natural product combretastatin A 4 the compounds were examined for inhibition of tubulin polymerization and the thiosulfonates were more active than the disulfides . The nine thiosulfonates had IC
