 Chondrocytes in joints are responsible for the formation and remodeling of articular cartilage . The accumulation of advanced glycation end products in cartilage is detrimental to the survival of chondrocytes . Linagliptin is one of the most commonly used anti diabetes agents and recent work indicates that it exerts an anti inflammatory effect in different cell types . In this study we showed that Linagliptin had a protective role in AGEs induced chondrocyte injury . The presence of Linagliptin ameliorated AGEs induced reactive oxygen species induction and reduced cellular protein carboxyl content . Linagliptin mitigated AGEs induced mitochondrial membrane potential

@highlight Linagliptin reduced AGEs induced increase in ROS and protein carboxyl.
@highlight Linagliptin protected ATDC5 cells against AGEs induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
@highlight Linagliptin reduced AGEs induced expression of NOX 4 HMGB 1 and MMP 2 9.
@highlight Linagliptin prevented AGEs induced apoptosis in a mitochondria dependent pathway.
