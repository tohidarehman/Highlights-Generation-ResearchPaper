 Developing brain is very sensitive to the influence of environmental factors during gestation and the neonatal period . The aim of the study is to assess cobalt and iron accumulation in the brain as well as changes in the expression of iron regulatory proteins transferrin receptor 1 hepcidin and ferroportin in suckling mice . Perinatal exposure to cobalt chloride increased significantly cobalt content in brain tissue homogenates of 18 day old and 25 day old mice inducing alterations in brain iron homeostasis . Higher degree of transferrin receptor 1 expression was demonstrated in cobalt chloride exposed mice with no substantial changes between d18 and d25 mice . A weak ferroportin expression was found in 18 day old control and cobalt treated mouse brain . Cobalt exposure of d25 mice resulted in increased ferroportin expression in brain compared to the untreated age matched control group . Hepcidin level in cobalt exposed groups was decreased in d18 mice and slightly increased in d25 mice . The obtained data contribute for the better understanding of metal toxicity impact on iron homeostasis in the developing brain with further possible implications in neurodegeneration .
