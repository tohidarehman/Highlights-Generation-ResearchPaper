 Herein we report on a new series of hydrazidoureidobenzensulfonamides investigated as inhibitors of the cytosolic human hCA I and II isoforms as well as the transmembrane tumor associated enzymes hCA IX and XII . The reported derivatives contain a 4 substituted piperidine fragment in which the hydrazidoureido linker has been involved as spacer between the benzenesulfonamide fragment which binds the zinc ion from the active site and the tail of the inhibitor .

@highlight Hydrazidoureidobenzensulfonamides were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Sulfonamides were assayed
@highlight as human Carbonic Anhydrase CA isoforms inhibitors.
@highlight Synthesized compounds show weak activity against off target CA I isoform.
@highlight Some sulfonamides are CA II IX XII selective inhibitors representing leads for pharmacological applications.
@highlight Docking revealed that CA selective inhibition is related to distinguished interactions.
