 Ectonucleotidases are a broad family of ectoenzymes that play a crucial role in purinergic cell signaling . Ecto nucleotide pyrophosphatases phosphodiesterases belong to this group and are important drug targets . In particular NPP1 and NPP3 are known to be druggable targets for treatment of impaired calcification disorders and cancer respectively . In this study we investigated a series of sulfonate and sulfamate derivatives of benzofuran and benzothiophene as potent and selective inhibitors of NPP1 and NPP3 . Compounds

@highlight 20 target compounds were investigated as inhibitors of human NPP1 and 3.
