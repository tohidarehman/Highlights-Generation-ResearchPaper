 A major goal of medicinal chemists is to identify and validate novel and effective kinase targets for treatment of cancer . Recent studies have shown that cyclin dependent kinase 8 is a target for treatment of colorectal breast melanoma and prostate cancers . The crystal structure of CDK8 has been reported and eutectic interactions have been identified for 24 compounds that target CDK8 . To more effectively develop CDK8 inhibitors particularly those with improved selectivity we summarized the structure structureactivity relationships and binding information of typical CDK8 inhibitors which may serve as a reference for development of novel CDK8 inhibitors .

@highlight CDK8 inhibitors were reviewed.
@highlight Binding information of typical CDK8 inhibitors were discovered.
@highlight Effective binding regions were discovered.
