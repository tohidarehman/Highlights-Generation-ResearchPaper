 Diphenols such as homogentisic acid gentisic acid etamsylate and calcium dobesilate interfere with diagnostic tests utilizing the Trinder reaction but the mechanisms of these effects are not fully understood . We observed substantial differences both in oxidation of

@highlight The mechanisms and magnitude of interference depended on compounds structure.
@highlight Homogentisic acid with an electron donating substituent caused strong interference.
@highlight  Diphenols with electron withdrawing substituents caused moderate interference.
@highlight HRP oxidized homogentisic acid rapidly and other
@highlight  diphenols slowly.
@highlight All
@highlight  diphenols prevented chromophore formation by reducing HRP generated radicals.
