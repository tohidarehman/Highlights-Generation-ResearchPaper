 Current therapies fail to eradicate colorectal Cancer Stem Cells . One of the proposed reasons for this failure is the selection by chemotherapy exposure of resistant cells responsible for tumor recurrence . In this regard CXCR4 overexpression in tumor associates with resistance and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients . In this study the effectiveness of engineered CXCR4 targeted self assembling toxin nanoparticles has been explored in the selective killing of CXCR4

@highlight Current therapies fail to eradicate colorectal cancer stem cells CRC CSCs due to their potent anti apoptotic defenses.
@highlight Upregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 plays a critical role in developing resistance to chemotherapy.
@highlight CXCR4 targeted toxins kill CRC CSCs in form of nanoparticles with highly selective antitumor effect.
@highlight Targeted toxins induce pyroptosis when apoptosis is blocked with a great therapeutic potential in drug resistant tumors.
