 In drug resistant phytopathogenic fungi there has been extensive research on microbiological and antifungal drug development . In this study a novel series of cylopentapyrazole bearing a 1 2 3 thiadiazole ring

@highlight A new series of cylopentapyrazole bearing a 1 2 3 thiadiazole ring was designed and synthesized.
@highlight  3 2 cycloaddition with 4 methyl 1 2 3 thiadiazole 5 carboxylic acid hydrazones and cyclopentadiene were accomplished.
@highlight Computational binding studies of these novel molecules against Cyp51 enzyme protein were conducted.
@highlight A combination of
