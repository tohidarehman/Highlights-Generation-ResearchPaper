 Parkinsons disease is characterized by profound microglial driven inflammatory processes and the loss of dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra . Both microglia and dopamine neurons that are affected in the SNc are particularly vulnerable to environmental toxicants and finding more selective ways of targeting these cell types is of importance . Quantum dots might be a useful vehicle for selectively delivering toxicants to microglia and owing to their fluorescent capability they can be microscopically tracked within the cell . Accordingly we assessed the impact of QDs alone and QDs conjugated to the ribosomal toxin saporin upon SNc microglia and dopamine neurons . We found that intra SNc infused QDs selectively entered microglia and induced morphological changes consistent with an activated state . QDs conjugated to saporin also caused a significant loss of dopamine neurons and motor coordination deficits along with an increase in the inflammatory microglial actin regulatory factors WAVE2 . These data suggest that QDs might be a viable route for toxicant delivery and also has an added advantage of being fluorescently visible . Ultimately we found SNc neurons to be exceptionally vulnerable to QD saporin and suggest that this could be a novel targeted approach to model PD like inflammatory pathology .

@highlight Quantum dots QDs were selectively taken up by microglia and activated these cells.
@highlight QDs alone had minimal effect son neurons and astrocytes.
@highlight Saporin conjugated QDs QD SAP were toxic to nigral dopaminergic neurons.
@highlight QD SAP caused marked behavioral impairment.
@highlight QD SAP increased nigral levels of the inflammatory factors CX3CR1 and WAVE2.
