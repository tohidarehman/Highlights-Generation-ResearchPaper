 Chinese bayberry leaves proanthocyanidins belongs to the prodelphinidin category with potent EGCG unit whose inhibition effect on amylase and their interaction were investigated by

@highlight Chinese bayberry leaves proanthocyanidins BLPs is a polymer with terminal and most extension units of EGCG.
@highlight BLPs showed as a potent inhibitor on starch digesibility and amylase in a mixed type manner.
@highlight Binding of BLPs with amylase was clarified by multi fluorescence spectroscopy.
@highlight Probable inhibition mechanism was elucidated by spectroscopy and molecular docking.
