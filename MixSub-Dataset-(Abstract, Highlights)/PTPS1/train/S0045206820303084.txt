 The chemistry of an organic charge transfer complex between pyrazole and chloranilic acid has been explored in ethanol at room temperature . The synthesized complex has been characterized by various techniques such as FTIR NMR Single crystal X ray diffraction and UVvisible spectroscopy . These techniques indicate that the cation and anion are joined together by the weak hydrogen bonding . This molecular framework is a result of inter N
