 Herein the efficacy of free deferiprone and DFP loaded starch polyethylene glycol polyacrylic acid nanogel in modulating the biochemical changes induced by glycerol model of rhabdomyolysis in male rats was investigated . In this respect gamma radiation induced crosslinking was used to produce St PEG PAAc nanogel particles and then it was used as a nanocarrier for DFP as an attempt to overcome the poor bioavailability and short half life of DFP . St PEG PAAc nanogel was characterized by Fourier transform infrared dynamic light scattering and Transmission electron microscopy . Free DFP was administered to rats in two doses 25 and 50mg following RBD induction while the loaded nanogel was administered at a dose of 25mg . The liver and kidney functions were then fully assessed in association with the histological tissue examination of both organs and the femur muscle . Both doses of DFP significantly antagonized the RBD induced changes in most of the assessed organs functions . The higher dose of DFP however showed a statistically more pronounced modulation of RBD effects on each of kidney liver and skeletal muscles . Nano DFP at 25mg dose resulted in a statistically significant correction of most of the RBD related biomarkers with a comparable magnitude to the higher DFP dose rather than the corresponding lower one .

@highlight Nanogel co polymer was prepared by gamma radiation induced polymerization.
@highlight Rhabdomyolysis was induced in rats by receiving a single intra muscular injection of glycerol.
@highlight Each of free DFP and nanogel loaded DFP was orally administered following rhabdomyolysis induction.
@highlight Nanogel loaded DFP was more effective in amelioration of the effects of rhabdomyolysis in liver kidney and skeletal muscles.
