 Hexokinase 2 is over expressed in most of human cancers and has been proved to be a promising target for cancer therapy . In this study based on the structure of HK2 we screened over 6 millions of compounds to obtain the lead . A total of 26

@highlight Three lead compounds were cherry picked from 6 053 287 small molecules through virtual ligand screening.
@highlight A series of novel HK2 inhibitors 
@highlight  were designed and synthesized based on the structure of the lead compound.
@highlight Compound
@highlight displayed the strongest inhibitory potency on HK2 activity and the growth of cancer cells.
