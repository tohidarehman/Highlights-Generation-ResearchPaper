 We aimed to assess serum neurofilament light chain levels in autism spectrum disorder and to investigate whether they are related to the severity of disease . The cohorts consisted of 166 children aged 38 . sNfL were analyzed using Single Molecule Array technology . ASD symptom severity was assessed according to the Chinese version of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale score . The mean age of those included ASD was 5.1 years 1.7 and 78.3 were boys . The mean sNfL concentrations were significantly higher in ASD than in TP children pg mL and 7.1pg mL . For each 1pg mL increase of sNfL the risk of ASD would increase by 19 with the OR The data showed that sNfL was elevated in ASD and related to symptom severity suggesting that sNfL may play a role in ASD progression .

@highlight Serum neurofilament light chain sNfL levels is a marker of neuroaxonal damage.
@highlight The sNfL concentrations in the ASD group were higher than in TP group.
@highlight sNfL in severe ASD were higher than in those mild to moderate ASD.
@highlight sNfL is an auxiliary diagnostic tool for the early detection of ASD and severe ASD.
