 Human DNA topoisomerase II is one of the major targets in anticancer therapy however ATP competitive inhibitors of this target have not yet reached their full potential . ATPase domain of human DNA topoisomerase II belongs to the GHKL ATPase superfamily and shares a very high 3D structural similarity with other superfamily members including bacterial topoisomerases . In this work we report the discovery of a new chemotype of ATP competitive inhibitors of human DNA topoisomerase II that were discovered through screening of in house library of ATP competitive inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV . Systematic screening of this library provided us with 20 hit compounds . 1 2 4 Substituted

@highlight Discovery of novel chemotype of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors.
@highlight Bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors were an excellent starting point in search of new topo II inhibitors.
@highlight The most potent inhibitor had an IC
@highlight of 3.2M on topo II.
@highlight Two compounds showed very potent activity on MCF 7 cell line IC
@highlight  10M .
