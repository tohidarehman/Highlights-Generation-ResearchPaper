 Intra articular injections are the most direct route for administering osteoarthritis therapies yet how drug carriers distribute within the joint remains understudied . To this end we developed a magnetic composite nanoparticle that can be tracked with fluorescence in vivo via an in vivo imaging system and quantified ex vivo via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy . Using this particle the effects of age and OA pathogenesis on particle clearance and distribution were evaluated in the medial meniscus transection model of OA . At 9weeks after meniscus transection composite nanoparticles were injected and joint clearance was assessed via IVIS . At 2weeks after injection animals were euthanized and particle distribution was quantified ex vivo via EPR spectroscopy . IVIS and EPR spectroscopy data indicate a predominant amount of particles remained in the joint after 14days . EPR spectroscopy data suggests particles cleared more slowly from OA knees than from the contralateral control with particles clearing more slowly from 15 month old rats than from 5 and 10 month old rats . This study demonstrates the importance of including both age and OA as factors when evaluating nanoparticles for intra articular drug delivery .

@highlight Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy can sensitively assess biodistribution.
@highlight Particles clear more slowly from OA knees compared to contralateral controls.
@highlight Intra articular particle retention is increased in older animals.
