 From a medical point of view lot of existing antibiotics became unusable because microbial gained strong antibiotic resistance . The combination of two compounds in one core may lead to kill such type of pathogens . Herein we developed pyranopyrazole derivatives comprising benzoxazole moiety by green approach strategy and studied their antimicrobial performance on four bacteria and two fungi . As a result most of the compounds delivered reliable toxicity to kill the pathogens . In those

@highlight Green synthetic strategy applied resulted compounds tested for their toxicity on microbial.
@highlight Most of the compounds delivered reliable toxicity to kill the bacteria and fungi.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight showed high binding energy and high antimicrobial property.
