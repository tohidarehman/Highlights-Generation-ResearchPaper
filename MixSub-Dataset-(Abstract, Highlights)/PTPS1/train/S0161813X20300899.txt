 Alzheimer s disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and neuronal damage . The present study investigated the effect of chronic intra hippocampal agmatine administration on Amyloid induced memory impairment in mice . A

@highlight A injected mice demonstrated impaired cognitive abilities.
@highlight A injections in mice elevated the levels of BACE 1 MAPt IL 6 and TNF .
@highlight A injected mice reduced agmatine neprilysin and BDNF in PFC and hippocampus.
@highlight Administration of agmatine prevented the memory impairment on 28th day.
@highlight Agmatine normalized the neuroinflammation associated markers PFC and hippocampus.
