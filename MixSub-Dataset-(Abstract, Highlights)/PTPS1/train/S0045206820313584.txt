 Poncirin a natural flavanone glycoside present abundantly in many citrus fruits contains an extensive range of biological activities . However the antidiabetic mechanism of poncirin is unexplored yet . In this study we examined the anti diabetic prospective of poncirin by evaluating its ability to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B glucosidase human recombinant AR rat lens aldose reductase and advanced glycation end product formation IC

@highlight Poncirin strongly inhibit glucosidase PTP1B RLAR HRAR and AGE IC
@highlight 7.76 11.91 3.56 3.23M .
@highlight Poncirin stimulates glucose uptake and decrease PTP1B level in insulin resistant C2C12 muscle cells.
@highlight Poncirin activate GLUT4 via IRS 1 PI3K Akt and GSK 3 signaling pathway.
@highlight Poncirin suppresses glycation induced protein oxidation and formation of amyloid cross structures.
@highlight Poncirin might be useful for the treatment of diabetes and its complications.
