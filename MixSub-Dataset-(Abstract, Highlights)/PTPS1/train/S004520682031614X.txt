 Herein molecular hybridization strategy was utilized in the design of new benzosuberone thiazole derivatives . The structures of the synthesized hybrids were determined on the basis of elemental and spectral analyses . These compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against five bronchitis causing bacteria in addition to their anti tubercular activities . Most compounds revealed promising activities . Amongst active compounds benzosuberone dithiazole derivatives
