 In this study a system for oral delivery of oxaliplatin was prepared for metronomic chemotherapy to enhance antitumor efficacy and modulate tumor immunity . OXA was complexed with

@highlight OXA DCK NE was permeated through intestine via bile acid transport mediated uptake.
@highlight The oral bioavailability of OXA DCK NE was greater than that of free oxaliplatin.
@highlight Oral metronomic OXA DCK NE treatment effectively modulated tumor immunity.
@highlight OXA DCK NE induced immunogenic cell death and enhanced immune cell numbers.
@highlight OXA DCK NE and PD 1 exhibited synergistic antitumor effects.
