 Based on the approach of merged pharmacophores of GPR119 agonists and DPP 4 inhibitors a series of tetrahydropyridopyrimidine compounds were designed as dual GPR119 and DPP 4 modulators with hypoglycemic activity . Seven fragments extracted from DPP 4 inhibitors were hybridized with the scaffold of tetrahydropyridopyrimidine . Among them compound

@highlight A series of tetrahydropyridopyrimidine derivatives targeting GPR119 and DPP 4 were designed and synthesized.
@highlight Compound
@highlight was revealed to show both GPR119 agonistic and DPP 4 inhibitory activities.
@highlight Compound
@highlight demonstrated potent hypoglycemic effect compared with vildagliptin.
@highlight The 3D binding mode of
@highlight with DPP 4 was generated.
