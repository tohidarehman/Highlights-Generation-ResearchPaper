 The biotoxin okadaic acid is a lipophilic secondary metabolite of marine microalgae . Therefore OA accumulates in the fatty tissue of various shellfish and may thus enter the food chain . The ingestion of OA via contaminated marine species can lead to the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning syndrome characterized by the occurrence of a series of acute gastrointestinal symptoms in humans . In addition genotoxicity and tumor promoting properties of OA might constitute a long term threat to human health .

@highlight HepaRG cells are a suitable
@highlight model comparing long vs. short term exposure.
@highlight Okadaic acid induces presumably intrinsic apoptosis after short term treatment.
@highlight HepaRG cells compensated OA long term treatment with regard to apoptosis induction.
