 A substantial number of breast cancer patients with an overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 have residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy or become resistant to trastuzumab . Photodynamic therapy using nanobodies targeted to HER2 is a promising treatment option for these patients . Here we investigate the Nanobodies targeting HER2 were obtained from phage display selections . Monovalent nanobodies were engineered into a biparatopic construct . The specificity of selected nanobodies was tested in immunofluorescence assays and their affinity was evaluated in binding studies both performed in a panel of breast cancer cells varying in HER2 expression levels . The selected HER2 targeted nanobodies 1D5 and 1D5 18A12 were conjugated to the photosensitizer IRDye700DX and tested in The selected nanobodies remained functional after conjugation to the PS binding specifically and with high affinity to HER2 positive cells . Both nanobody PS conjugates potently and selectively induced cell death of HER2 overexpressing cells either sensitive or resistant to trastuzumab with low nanomolar LD Nanobody PS conjugates accumulated selectively

@highlight Nanobody targeted PDT induced significant tumor regression of HER2 tumors.
@highlight Nanobody targeted PDT is a potent alternative treatment for HER2 breast cancer.
