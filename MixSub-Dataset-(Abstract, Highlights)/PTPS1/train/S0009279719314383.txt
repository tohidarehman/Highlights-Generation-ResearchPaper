 Oxidized low density lipoprotein induced endothelial inflammation plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases . G protein coupled receptors are gaining traction as potential treatment targets due to their roles in mediating a wide range of physiological processes . GPR120 is a recently identified omega 3 fatty acid receptor . We hypothesized that agonism of GPR120 might attenuate ox LDL induced endothelial dysfunction . In the present study we tested the effects of two GPR120 agonistsGW9508 and TUG 891in mitigating endothelial insult induced by ox LDL in human aortic endothelial cells . Real time PCR western blot and ELISA analyses were used in our experiments . Our findings demonstrate that GPR120 is downregulated by exposure to ox LDL suggesting a role for GPR120 in mediating ox LDL insult . Furthermore we found that agonism of GPR120 could suppress oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines . Importantly we show that agonism of GPR120 prevents the attachment of monocytes to endothelial cells by suppressing the expression of VCAM 1 and E selectin . Finally we show that agonism of GPR120 exerts a remarkable atheroprotective effect by elevating the expression level of Krppel like factor 2 . Together our results demonstrate a potential role for specific agonism of GPR120 in the prevention of endothelial damages induced by ox LDL .
