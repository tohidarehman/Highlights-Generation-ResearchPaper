 Exposure to mycotoxins is mostly by ingestion but also occurs by the dermal and inhalation routes . The present study for the first time demonstrated that mycotoxin Deoxynivalenol permeates through

@highlight Deoxynivalenol DON a trichothecene mycotoxin penetrates through mice skin.
@highlight Protein Kinase C is involved in DON induced upregulation of COX2 and iNOS proteins.
@highlight Celecoxib reduces DON induced epidermal inflammation and cell proliferation.
@highlight Skin Permeation potential of Celecoxib is lower as compared to the oral route.
@highlight Celecoxib can effectively ameliorate mycotoxin induced skin inflammatory disorders.
