 The synthesis of seven new amino alcohols was designed and performed by starting from eugenol a natural phenolic compound known to be biologically active . The synthesized compounds were obtained in yields ranging from 54 to 81 . Molecule structures were determined with FT IR

@highlight A series of seven new amino alcohol derivatives were synthesized and characterized.
@highlight They are effective inhibitors against glycosidase and AChE.
@highlight The compounds also effectively inhibit hCA I and II isoenzymes.
@highlight Experimental results were compared with molecular docking calculations.
