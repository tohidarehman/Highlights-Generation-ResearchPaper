 SHP2 is a non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase encoded by the PTPN11 gene which affects the transduction of multiple signaling pathways including RAS ERK PI3K AKT and JAK STAT . SHP2 also plays an important role in the programmed cell death pathway . Studies have shown that SHP2 is associated with a variety of cancers including breast liver and gastric cancers . Therefore the development of SHP2 inhibitors has attracted extensive attention . In this study based on the known inhibitor 1 novel SHP2 inhibitors were designed by means of scaffold hopping and 35 pyridine derivatives as SHP2 inhibitors were found . The

@highlight This manuscript first reported pyridine derivatives as SHP2 inhibitors.
@highlight In this manuscript multiple SHP2 inhibitors with development value were obtained.
@highlight Molecular docking study investigated the binding pocket of protein and ligand.
