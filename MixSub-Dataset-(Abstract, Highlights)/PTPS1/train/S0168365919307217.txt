 Regulatory T cells are vital for maintaining a balanced immune response and their dysfunction is often associated with auto immune disorders . We have previously shown that antigen loaded anionic liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol and cholesterol can induce strong antigen specific Treg responses . We hypothesized that altering the rigidity of these liposomes while maintaining their size and surface charge would affect their capability of inducing Treg responses . The rigidity of liposomes is affected in part by the length and saturation of carbon chains of the phospholipids in the bilayer and in part by the presence of cholesterol . We used atomic force microscopy to measure the rigidity of anionic OVA
