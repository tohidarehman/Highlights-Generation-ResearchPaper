 Alzheimer s disease is a common neurodegenerative disease and its pathogenesis is closely related to amyloid peptide . The deposition of A in the brain due to impaired A clearance is considered as an important cause of AD . The decrease in A clearance is closely related to the autophagy dysfunction in brains of AD patients . It is feasible to treat AD by increasing the autophagy level of cells such as microglia and neurons to accelerate A clearance . In this article we explored the ability of graphene oxide to clear A through activating autophagy . Our work demonstrated that GO could inhibit the mTOR signaling pathway by activating AMPK to induce the autophagy of microglial and neurons . As expected with the improvement of autophagy ability of microglia GO promoted microglia mediated A phagocytosis . Under the conditions of co culture of microglia and neurons GO induced the autophagy of microglia and neurons especially the autophagy of microglia thereby promoting the clearance of A and ultimately achieved the effect of protecting neurons . Moreover GO was not only non cytotoxic to microglia and neurons but also able to reduce the toxicity of A to neurons through its clearance . These results have shown the potential of GO in treating Alzheimer s disease .
