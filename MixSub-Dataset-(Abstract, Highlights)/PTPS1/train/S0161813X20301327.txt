 Antimony is a potentially toxic chemical element abundantly found in the environment . We previously reported that Sb promoted neuronal deathvia reactive oxygen species dependent autophagy . Here we assessed the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein in Sb induced neuronal damage . We found that Sb treatment induced CREB phosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis both

@highlight CREB activation protected Sb induced neuronal apoptosis.
@highlight JNK pathway activation contributed to Sb stimulated CREB phosphorylation.
@highlight JNK CREB activation alleviates Sb induced neuronal apoptosis through Bcl 2 regulation.
