 Many tests have shown cyclooxygenase 2 was closely related to the activation of hepatic stellate cells which further promoting the onset and development of hepatic fibrosis . According to these research findings a series of glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives were designed and synthesized . Meanwhile their anti hepaticfibrotic activities were evaluated in vitro and in vivo . Firstly in the tests of the cell models all the compounds displayed anti proliferative effect on the HSC T6 activated by TGF

@highlight Developed glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives on anti hepatic fibrosis research.
@highlight Anti hepaticfibrotic activities of compounds were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.
@highlight Compounds 2 and 16 have the potential as candidates to anti hepatic fibrosis.
