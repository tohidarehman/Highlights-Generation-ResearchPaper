 The ongoing prevalence of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens requires the development of new effective antibacterial agents . In this study two series of halogenated 1 3 thiazolidin 4 ones were synthesized and characterized . All the synthesized thiazolidinone derivatives were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity . Biological screening of the tested compounds revealed the antibacterial activity of the chlorinated thiazolidinones
