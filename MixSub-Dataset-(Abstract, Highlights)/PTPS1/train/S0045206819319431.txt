 The tumor microenvironment in chondrosarcoma a chemo and radio resistant cancer provides unique hallmarks for developing a chondrosarcoma targeted drugdelivery system . Tumor targeting could be achieved using a quaternary ammonium function as a ligand for aggrecan the main high negative charged proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix of CHS and a 2 nitroimidazole as trigger that enables hypoxiaresponsive drug release . In a previous work
