 Searching for new less toxic anticancer drug candidates is a big challenge from a medical point of view . The present investigation was aimed at describing two independent synthetic approaches based on isosteric replacements spectroscopic characteristics

@highlight Novel heteroannelation routes leading to new congeneric classes have been developed.
