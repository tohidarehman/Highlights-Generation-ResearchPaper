 Ruthenium metal complex has been shown to exert several chemical and biological activities . A series of three novel ruthenium derivatives

@highlight Anti inflammatory and hepatoprotective effect of ruthenium complexes was studied in macrophages and mice.
@highlight Ruthenium TQ 4 recovers induced inflammatory mediators and liver histological alterations.
@highlight TQ 4 suppressed LPS induced NF B signaling pathway in liver tissues and macrophages.
@highlight TQ 4 potently scavenged OH and suggests that TQ 4 may have probable antioxidant property.
@highlight The phenyl substitution in TQ 4 may increase hydrophobicity and contribute the hepatoprotective effects.
@highlight This study inferred that TQ 4 might be a promising therapeutic agent for treating the liver injury.
