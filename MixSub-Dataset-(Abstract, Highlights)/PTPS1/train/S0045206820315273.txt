 Inspired with an increasing environmental awareness we performed an eco friendly amenable process for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using the catkins of

@highlight Catkin extract of
@highlight was used to optimize and biosynthesize AgNPs.
@highlight Biosynthesized AgNPs were characterized using UV FTIR TEM XPS GC MS and XRD.
@highlight The antibacterial activity of the AgNPs was determined against 7 different food borne pathogens.
