 Intracellular biothiols are correlated with many diseases such as nerve disorder and Parkinsons disease likely due to a redox imbalance . In this work we designed an ultrafast fluorescent probe

@highlight The article reports an ultrafast far red fluorescent probe 
@highlight  for biothiols with a large Stokes shift of 131nm.
@highlight The probe was constructed by fusing an additional benzene ring.
@highlight The probe showed ultrafast response to biothiols emitting a strong red fluorescence at 617nm on excitation at 480nm.
@highlight The probe was successfully employed to visualize biothiol fluctuations in living cells damaged by oxidative stress and mice.
