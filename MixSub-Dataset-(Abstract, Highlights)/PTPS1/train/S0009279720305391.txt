 Hetero mononuclear rhenium metal complexes using different substituted indole pyrazoline based ligands were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and analytical methods . The binding of the rhenium complexes to Herring sperm DNA was monitored by UV spectroscopy viscosity measurements and molecular docking studies groove binding was suggested as the most possible mode and the DNA binding constants of the complexes were evaluated .
