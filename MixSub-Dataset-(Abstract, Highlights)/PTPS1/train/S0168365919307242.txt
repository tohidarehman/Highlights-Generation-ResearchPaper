 GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is maintained outside the brain by the blood brain barrier in normal condition . In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of modulating brain activity in the visual cortex of non human primates by transiently permeabilizing the blood brain barrier using focused ultrasound coupled with ultrasound contrast agents followed by intra venous injection of GABA . The visual evoked potentials exhibited a significant and GABA dose depend decrease in activity . The effect of the sonication only was also investigated and was shown to decrease the activity 8.7 times less than the GABA induced inhibition enabled by BBB permeabilization . Finally the UCA harmonic response was monitored during sonication to estimate the level of stable cavitation and to avoid damage due to inertial cavitation . Our results extend the promise of the exploration and treatment of the brain using non invasive controllable repeatable and reversible neuromodulation .

@highlight We modulated the activity of the visual cortex of non human primates by delivering GABA with transient permeabilization of the blood brain barrier BBB induced by focused ultrasound FUS coupled with ultrasound contrast agents UCA .
@highlight The effect of the sonication only with and without UCA was also investigated and its impact was shown to be 8.7 times less than the GABA induced inhibition.
