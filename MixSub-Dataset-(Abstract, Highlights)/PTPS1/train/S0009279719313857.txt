 Quaternary ammonium compounds and cetylpyridinium chloride constitute a group of cationic surfactants are widely used for personal hygiene and medical care despite the potential pulmonary toxicity . To examine whether BAC and CPC aerosols deposited in the alveolar region alter pulmonary function we studied the effects on pulmonary surfactant using two step

@highlight Deposition of disinfectant on the lung surface alter the alveolar surface activity.
@highlight Disinfectants change the shape of A isotherm in pulmonary surfactant monolayer.
@highlight A hydrophobic tail hydrocarbon group of disinfectant interacts with surfactant lipid.
@highlight Disinfectants result in smaller condensed lipid domain of pulmonary monolayer.
@highlight Disinfectants cause cell death via caspase 3 dependent apoptotic pathway.
