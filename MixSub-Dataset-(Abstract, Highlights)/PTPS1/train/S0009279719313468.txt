 Stearoyl CoA desaturase generates monounsaturated fatty acids which contribute to cell growth survival differentiation metabolic regulation and signal transduction . Overexpression of SCD is evident and implicated in metabolic diseases such as diabetes and non alcoholic fatty liver disease . SCD also stimulates canonical Wnt pathway and YAP activation in support of stemness and tumorigenesis . SCD facilitates metabolic reprogramming in cancer which is mediated at least in part by regulation of AKT AMPK and NF kB via MUFAs . Our research has revealed the novel positive loop to amplify Wnt signaling through stabilization of LRP5 6 in both hepatic stellate cells and liver tumor initiating stem cell like cells . As such this loop is pivotal in promoting liver fibrosis and liver tumor development . This review summarizes the mechanisms of SCD mediated tumor promotion described by recent studies and discusses the future prospect for SCD mediated signaling crosstalk as a potential therapeutic target for cancer .

@highlight Stearoyl CoA desaturase which produces monounsaturated fatty acids is increasingly recognized to promote malignancies of different organs and this review article discusses potential mechanisms underlying this link.
