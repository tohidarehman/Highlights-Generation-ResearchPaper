 Given the important role of biothiols in various physiological processes there is a need to develop novel fluorescent sensors for detecting them . Herein a novel on off on fluorescent sensor

@highlight Sensor
@highlight showed a turn on fluorescent response for glutathione based on its copper complex.
@highlight The detection limits of sensor
@highlight were 0.17M to Cu
@highlight and 0.20M to GSH.
@highlight Sensor
@highlight can be used for filter paper strip test.
@highlight Sensor
@highlight has good cell permeability and could be used as an efficient sensor for mapping Cu
@highlight and GSH in living cells.
