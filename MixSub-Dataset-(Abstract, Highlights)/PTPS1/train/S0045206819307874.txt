 Oxyntomodulin is an endogenous gastrointestinal hormone which activates both the Glucagon like peptide 1 receptor and the glucagon receptor . However OXM has shortcomings including poor GLP 1R agonism to control glycemia short half life and others . Inspired from the sequence relationship between OXM and glucagon in this study we introduced different C terminus residues of GLP 1 exenatide and OXM to glucagon to get a series of hybrid peptides with enhanced GLP 1R activation . The formed glucagon exenatide hybrid peptide shows higher GLP 1R activation properties than OXM . Then the peptides based on the glucagon exenatide hybrid peptide were coupled with fatty acid side chains to prolong their half lives . As a result the most potent compound
