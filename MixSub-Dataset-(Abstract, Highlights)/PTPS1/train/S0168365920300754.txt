 Intraperitoneal insulin delivery has higher benefits than subcutaneous insulin administration but has limitations including obstruction of the catheter used in delivery devices . To overcome these limitations this study assessed safety and efficacy of an alternative approach involving a new delivery device named ExOlin

@highlight Despites its efficacy i.p. insulin faces issues including catheter obstruction.
@highlight Extraperitoneal is safe for implantation of ExOlin a new delivery device.
@highlight Extraperitoneal insulin delivery via ExOlin shows high efficacy in diabetic rats.
@highlight This approach provides in rat and swine portal levels comparable to i.p. insulin.
@highlight ExOlin in extraperitoneal may replace i.p. devices for physiological delivery.
