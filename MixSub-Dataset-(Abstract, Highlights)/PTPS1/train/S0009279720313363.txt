 Cisplatin based chemotherapy is a common first line regimen for treating nonsmall cell lung cancer . However drug resistance is still a major problem . The purposes of this study were to evaluate whether sclareol can reverse cisplatin resistance and to investigate its possible mechanisms . A549 cells the human NSCLC cells with inherent cisplatin resistance were used to investigate synergistic effect of sclareol with cisplatin in cell proliferation and migration as well as its regulatory mechanisms in expression of excision repair cross complementation group 1 a cisplatin resistance associated molecule . Nude mice bearing subcutaneous A549 tumors were applied to investigate synergistic activity of sclareol in anti tumor . As comparing to the cisplatin alone group the treatment of cisplatin combined with sclareol significantly suppressed survival rate and cell migration of A549cells . Besides sclareol also exhibited suppression in ERCC1 expression by inhibiting AKT GSK3 AP1 Snail and JNK AP1 pathways . Furthermore the experimental data from

@highlight Drug resistance is still a critical issue in clinical chemotherapy.
@highlight Platinum based compounds such as cisplatin are first line drugs for treating non small cell lung cancer NSCLC .
@highlight Excision repair cross complementation group 1 ERCC1 a DNA repair enzyme involved in cisplatin resistance.
@highlight Sclareol is a natural aromatic compound with the activity of suppressing ERCC1 expression.
@highlight Sclareol can be used as an adjuvant drug to enhance cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in NSCLC chemotherapy.
