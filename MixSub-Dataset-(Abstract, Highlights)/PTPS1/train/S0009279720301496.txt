 In the present study eighteen inhibitors of the hydrolytic enzymes of the endocannabinoid system were investigated for antioxidant activity using lipid peroxidation method . Among the assayed compounds ten belong to carbamates with phenyl 3 ylcarbamate

@highlight antioxidant activity was evaluated using lipid peroxidation LP method.
@highlight activity of the most potent compound 
@highlight  was comparable with standard antioxidants.
@highlight Theoretical calculations were involved in order to clarify a possible mechanism of action.
@highlight Appropriate models for HAT SET and SPLET mechanisms of the antioxidant activity are proposed.
