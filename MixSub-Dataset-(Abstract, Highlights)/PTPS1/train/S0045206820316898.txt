 PTPN11 a classic non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase is implicated in multiple cell signaling pathway . Abnormal activation of SHP2 has been shown to contribute to a variety of human diseases including Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia Noonan syndrome and tumors . Thus the SHP2 inhibitors have important therapeutic value . Here based on the compound PubChem CID 8 478 960 IC

@highlight Manuscript firstly reported thiophene 2 3 
@highlight  pyrimidine derivatives as SHP2 inhibitors.
@highlight phosphatase activity of the compounds was tested IC
@highlight  0.437.87M .
@highlight Molecular mechanism of Comp 5 affecting on SHP2 structure function was analyzed.
@highlight The interaction between Comp 5 and ARG362 increased the selectivity.
