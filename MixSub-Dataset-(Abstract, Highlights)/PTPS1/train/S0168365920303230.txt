 Pancreatic cancer is usually advanced and drug resistant at diagnosis . A potential therapeutic approach outlined here uses nanoparticle based drug carriers which have unique properties that enhance intra tumor drug exposure and reduce systemic toxicity of encapsulated drugs . Here we report that patients whose pancreatic cancers express elevated levels of Death Receptor 5 and its downstream regulators effectors FLIP Caspase 8 and FADD had particularly poor prognoses . To take advantage of elevated expression of this pathway we designed drug loaded NPs with a surface conjugated DR5 antibody . Binding and clustering of the DR5 is a prerequisite for efficient apoptosis initiation and the DR5 NPs were indeed found to activate apoptosis in multiple pancreatic cancer models whereas the free antibody did not . The extent of apoptosis induced by DR5 NPs was enhanced by down regulating FLIP a key modulator of death receptor mediated activation of caspase 8 . Moreover the DNA topoisomerase 1 inhibitor camptothecin down regulated FLIP in pancreatic cancer models and enhanced apoptosis induced by DR5 NPs . CPT loaded DR5 NPs significantly increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability

@highlight The death receptor 5 pathway is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and correlates with poorer prognosis.
