 Some important pro inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 tumor necrosis factor and nitric oxide are thought to play key roles in the destruction of cartilage and bone tissue in joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis . In the present study a series of new myricetin pentadienone hybrids were designed and synthesized . Majority of them effectively inhibited the expressions liposaccharide induced secretion of IL 6 TNF and NO in RAW264.7 . The most prominent compound

@highlight New myricetin pentadienone hybrids were synthesized.
