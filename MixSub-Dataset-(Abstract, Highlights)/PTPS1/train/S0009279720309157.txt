 Hyperuricosuria is associated with kidney stone disease especially uric acid and calcium oxalate types . Nevertheless detailed mechanisms of hyperuricosuria induced kidney stone formation remained unclear . This study examined changes in cellular proteome and function of renal tubular cells after treatment with high dose UA for 48 h. Quantitative proteomics using 2 DE followed by nanoLC ESI ETD MS MS tandem mass spectrometry revealed significant changes in levels of 22 proteins in the UA treated cells . These proteomic data could be confirmed by Western blotting . Functional assays revealed an increase in intracellular ATP level and enhancement of tissue repairing capability in the UA treated cells . Interestingly levels of HSP70 and HSP90 were increased in apical membranes of the UA treated cells . CaOx crystal cell adhesion assay revealed significant increase in CaOx binding capability of the UA treated cells whereas neutralization of the surface HSP70 and or HSP90 using their specific monoclonal antibodies caused significant reduction in such binding capability . These findings highlighted changes in renal tubular cells in response to high dose UA that may at least in part explain the pathogenic mechanisms of hyperuricosuria induced mixed kidney stone disease .
