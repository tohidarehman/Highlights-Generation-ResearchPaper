 Novel symmetric molecules bearing a benzidine prolinamide core two terminal carbamate caps of variable sizes and nature including natural and unnatural amino acids were developed . Several terminal

@highlight Twenty five compounds were synthesized and structurally elucidates.
@highlight Several compounds showed EC50s in the picomolar or nanomolar range against HCV genotype 1b with selectivity indices up to 7 orders of magnitude.
@highlight Particular candidates were better than the clinical candidate Daclatasvir.
@highlight Active molecules are with unnatural amino acids amino acids other than valine and with carbamates other than methyl.
