 Ifosfamide a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug has been frequently associated with encephalopathy and central nervous system toxicity . The present study aims to investigate whether morin could protect against acute IFA induced neurotoxicity . Morin was administered to male rats once daily for 2 consecutive days at doses of 100 and 200mg kg body weight orally . IFA was administered on second day . The results showed that morin markedly inhibited the production of acetylcholinesterase butrylcholinesterase carbonic anhydrase glial fibrillary acidic protein brain derived neurotrophic factor and nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 induced by IFA . Morin ameliorated IFA induced lipid peroxidation glutathione depletion and decrease antioxidant enzyme activities catalase superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase . Histopathological changes and immunohistochemical expressions of c Jun N terminal kinase and c Fos in the IFA induced brain tissues were decreased after administration of morin . Furthermore morin was able to down regulate the levels of inflammatory and apoptotic markers such as nuclear factor kappa B neuronal nitric oxide synthase tumor necrosis factor p53 cysteine aspartate specific protease 3 and B cell lymphoma 2 . Taken together our results demonstrated that morin elicited a typical chemoprotective effect on IFA induced acute neurotoxicity .
