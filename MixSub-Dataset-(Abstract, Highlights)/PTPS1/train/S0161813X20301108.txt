 Glutamate is a crucial neurotransmitter of the mammalian central nervous system a molecular component of our diet and a popular food additive . However for decades concerns have been raised about the issue of glutamates safety as a food additive especially with regards to its ability to cross the blood brain barrier cause excitotoxicity or lead to neuron death . Results of animal studies following glutamate administration via different routes suggest that an array of effects can be observed . While some of the changes appear deleterious some are not fully understood and the impact of others might even be beneficial . These observations suggest that with regards to the mammalian brain exogenous glutamate might exert a double sided effect and in essence be a two faced molecule whose effects may be dependent on several factors . This review draws from the research experiences of the authors and other researchers regarding the effects of exogenous glutamate on the brain of rodents . We also highlight the possible implications of such effects on the brain in health and disease . Finally we deduce that beyond the culinary effects of exogenous glutamate there is the possibility of a beneficial role in the understanding and management of brain disorders .
