 Owing to the low efficacy and acquired resistance in clinical trials of c Met inhibitors based on the synergistic effects between c Met and HDAC novel c Met and HDAC dual inhibitors were designed and synthesized . We introduced 2 pyrrolidinone to form the 5 atoms linker for c Met inhibitor and hydroxamic acid as a zinc binding motif for HDAC inhibitor . The highly active dual inhibitor

@highlight A series of novel c Met HDAC Dual Inhibitors were designed synthesized.
@highlight showed better cytotoxicity against tested cells and comparative enzymatic inhibitory than positive control.
@highlight induced the apoptosis of HCT 116 cells in a dose dependent manner.
@highlight Cell cycle analysis showed that
@highlight significantly caused G2 M phase arrest in HCT 116 cells.
@highlight Docking mode indicated
@highlight could form critical bonding interactions with c Met and HDAC1.
