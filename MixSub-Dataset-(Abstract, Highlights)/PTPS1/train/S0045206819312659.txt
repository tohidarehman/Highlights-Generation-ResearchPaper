 Unassymetric bis bis derivatives with a DPA functionality for zinc binding have been developed with an efficient synthetic route using the retrosynthetic analysis . Comparison of bis derivatives with different substitution patterns allows us to verify and optimize their unique fluorescence properties . Upon binding zinc cation bis derivatives give a large fluorescence turn on in both visible
