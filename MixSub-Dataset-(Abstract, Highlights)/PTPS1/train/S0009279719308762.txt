 Treatment of breast cancer by paclitaxel often encounters therapeutic failure most likely caused by innate acquired resistance . Cancer stem cells and multidrug resistance complex overexpression are main mechanisms implicated in chemoresistance . Increased aldehyde dehrogenase 1 was previously correlated with the stemness features of CSCs and hence is used as a marker for identification and CSCs targeting . The present study therefore aimed at investigating the effect of both curcumin and vitamin D3 on MDR 1 and ALDH 1 expression and consequently the resistance to PAX both

@highlight Combining both curcumin and vitamin D3 to paclitaxel was studied.

@highlight Paclitaxel monotherapy showed increased ALDH 1 and MDR 1 levels.
@highlight The triple therapy showed the lowest levels of ALDH 1.
@highlight The triple therapy showed the lowest levels of MDR 1 and tumor size.
