 Current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of bone metastases are often limited by the lack of selectivity severe systemic toxicity and suboptimal efficacy . Nanomedicine meditated chemo photodynamic therapy provides a promising therapeutic opportunity for enhanced cancer therapy . Herein we constructed an alendronate functionalized bone seeking nanoagent

@highlight A light triggered self reinforced nanoagent for enhanced cancer therapy is designed
@highlight Bone targeted chemo photodynamic therapy is first used in bone metastases treatment
@highlight Utilization of proteasome inhibitor to potentiate the photodynamic therapy outcome
@highlight Inducing ER stress and oxidative stress for synergistic therapy of bone metastases
@highlight Elaboration the mechanism of apoptosis mediated by chemo photodynamic therapy
