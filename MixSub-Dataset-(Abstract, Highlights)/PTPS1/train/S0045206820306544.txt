 As revealed in previous reports calycosin is a functional flavonoid characterized with identified pharmacological activities . Most of evidences are used to demonstrate the anti cancer benefits of calycosin however the existing study of anti fatty liver medicated by calycosin is limitedly reported . Recently an emerging avenue based on network pharmacology may contribute to excavate the biological targets and molecular mechanisms of calycosin for anti fatty liver . In confirmatory experiments the human and animal studies were subjected to verify some of bioinformatic results . Accordingly bioinformatic data based on network pharmacology suggested that discoverable biotargets of calycosin for anti fatty liver were aldehyde dehydrogenase Niemann pick C1 high mobility group protein 1 bilirubin UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 mitogen activated protein kinase 3 epidermal growth factor receptor hydroxytryptamine receptor 2 migration inhibitory factor cytochrome P450 family 19A1 . Furthermore all significant biological characteristics and mechanisms of to treat fatty liver were revealed in several . In human findings the blood tests showed changed glucose and lipid contents elevated insulin resistance and inflammatory stress . And fatty liver sections from patients resulted in negative expressions of ALDH2 NPC1 and positive HMGB1 expression . In a study
