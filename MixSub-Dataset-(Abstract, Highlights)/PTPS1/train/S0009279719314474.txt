 Type II diabetes is recognized as a major risk factor for death due to cardiovascular complications such as coronary heart disease but the complex interplay between these two diseases remains poorly understood . Suppression of oxidative stress apoptosis and inflammation of endothelial cells is a valuable treatment strategy to prevent or halt the progression of CHD . In the present study we used real time polymerase chain reaction Western blot analysis and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay to investigate the effects of saxagliptin on hypoxia inducible factors . Our findings demonstrate that saxagliptin can significantly improve cell viability in H9c2 cells as well as reduce hypoxia induced oxidative damage and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential . Saxagliptin reduced hypoxia induced NADPH oxidase 4 . We also show that saxagliptin can reduce the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 2 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 two important degradative enzymes . Saxagliptin also suppressed hypoxia induced expression of high mobility group box 1 protein a key inflammatory cytokine . Finally we show that saxagliptin can exert atheroprotective effects by reducing the expression of myeloid differential protein 88 and increasing the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 and heme oxygenase 1 . Thus saxagliptin shows promise as a treatment against diabetes associated CHD .
