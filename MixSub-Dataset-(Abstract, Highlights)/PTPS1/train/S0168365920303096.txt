 Ewing sarcoma is a bone and soft tissue tumor predominantly affecting adolescents and young adults . To characterize changes in anticancer drug activity and intratumor drug distribution during the evolution of Ewing sarcomas we used immunodeficient mice to establish pairs of patient derived xenografts at early and late stages of the disease from three patients . Analysis of copy number alterations in early passage PDX tissues showed that two tumor pairs established from patients which responded initially to therapy and relapsed more than one year later displayed similar CNAs at early and late stages . For these two patients PDX established from late tumors were more resistant to chemotherapy than early counterparts . In contrast the tumor pair established at refractory progression showed highly dissimilar CNA profiles and the pattern of response to chemotherapy was discordant with those of relapsed cases . In mice receiving irinotecan infusions the level of SN 38 in the intracellular tumor compartment was reduced in tumors at later stages compared to earlier tumors for those pairs bearing similar CNAs suggesting that distribution of anticancer drug shifted toward the extracellular compartment during clonal tumor evolution . Overexpression of the drug transporter P glycoprotein in late tumor was likely responsible for this shift in drug distribution in one of the cases .

@highlight We established three pairs of Ewing sarcoma PDX from the same patients at primary diagnosis and at later disease stages.
@highlight PDX pairs obtained at long term relapse developed chemoresistance and showed decreased intracellular drug concentration.
@highlight Copy number alteration profiles of these PDX pairs suggested a common clonal origin of tumors at both disease stages.
@highlight Overexpression of P glycoprotein was the likely cause of limited intracellular drug distribution in one of the tumor pairs.
