 galactosidases are able to catalyze two different types of reactions namely hydrolysis and transgalactosylation . It is a lysosomal exoglycosidase involved in the catabolism of glycoconjugates by sequential release of linked terminal galactosyl residues . It has profound significance in cancer cell senescence . It can be derived from microbial sources including bacteria yeasts and filamentous fungi . The enzyme was purified from the crude enzyme using ammonium sulfate precipitation dialysis ion exchange chromatography using DEAE cellulose fast protein liquid chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography . The enzyme was purified with 10.78 fold with specific activity of 62U mg of protein and yield of 28.26 . Molecular weight of galactosidase as estimated by using SDS PAGE was 42kDa . Kinetic parameters K
