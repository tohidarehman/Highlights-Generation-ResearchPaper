 The discovery of novel antibacterial molecules plays a key role in solving the current antibiotic crisis issue . Natural products have long been an important source of drug discovery . Herein we reviewed 256 natural products from 11 structural classes in the period of 201601 2020 which were selected by SciFinder with new compounds or new structures and MICs lower than 10g mL or 10M as criterions . This review will provide some effective antibacterial lead compounds for medicinal chemists which will promote the antibiotics research based on natural products to the next level .

@highlight Natural products are an important source of antibiotics candidates.
