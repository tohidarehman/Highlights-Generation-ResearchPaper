 COVID 2019 pandemic is affecting people worldwide in the absence of an effective treatment strategy . Several suggestive therapeutic options through drug repurposing are recommended but a complete consensus is not reached . A combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin has been widely tried and discussed but its administration has also led to potential adversities in patients . Studies are suggesting that most prominent adverse event with HCQ and AZM combination is QT interval prolongation . We studied interaction of HCQ with AZM and subsequent effect of this drug combination on QT interval prolongation . We performed system biological investigation of HCQ and AZM targets and screened important targets and pathways possibly involved in QT interval prolongation . The best core hub protein drug targets involved in QT interval prolongation were identified as HSP90AA1 exclusively associated with HCQ while AKT1 exclusively associated with AZM on the basis of node degree value . It was found that PI3K Akt VEGF ERBB2 pathways must be given consideration for understanding the role of HCQ and AZM in QT interval prolongation .

@highlight Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is widely tried for recent pandemic.
@highlight It is discussed to prolong QT interval causing severe adverse events.
@highlight Potential drug targets involved in this process were screened using system biology.
@highlight Pathways were also screened for drug combination mediated adverse events.
