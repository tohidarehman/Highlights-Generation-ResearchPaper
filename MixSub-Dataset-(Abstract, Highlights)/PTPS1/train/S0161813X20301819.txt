 Isoniazid is among the most important anti tuberculosis agents widely prescribed . However its clinical use is restricted due to its severe side effects associated with neurotoxicity . The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of chrysin a natural antioxidant against INH induced neurotoxicity in rats . The rats were treated orally with INH alone or with CR for 7 consecutive days . INH administration significantly increased brain lipid peroxidation and resulted in a significant decrease in antioxidant biomarkers including superoxide dismutase catalase glutathione peroxidase and glutathione . INH treatment also increased levels of nuclear factor kappa B tumor necrosis factor glial fibrillary acidic protein and activities of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase while decreasing levels of neural cell adhesion molecule . Double immunofluorescence expressions of c Jun N terminal kinase and Bcl 2 associated X protein in brain tissues were increased after INH administration . Furthermore INH increased mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 heme oxygenase 1 NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1 glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit NF B TNF interleukin 1 interleukin 6 and GFAP in rat brain tissues . Co treatment with CR increased anti oxidant capacity as well as regulated inflammation and apoptosis in brain . Additionally molecular docking results showed that CR had the potential to interact with the active sites of TNF and NF B . In conclusion CR improved INH induced brain oxidative damage inflammation and apoptosis possibly through their antioxidant properties .
