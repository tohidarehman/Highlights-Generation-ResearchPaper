 Long acting drug delivery systems with advanced functionalities are critically important to pharmacologically treat glaucomatous optic neuropathy a chronic and multifactorial neurodegenerative disease . Here a novel strategy based on the methoxylation effects of benzoic acid derivatives was exploited to rationally design a biodegradable and injectable thermogel which possesses potent antioxidant activities and sustained drug delivery abilities for treating glaucomatous nerve damage . In particular 4 hydroxy 3 5 dimethoxybenzoic acid consisting of two methoxyl groups and one hydroxyl group at the position para to the carboxylic group was demonstrated to contribute to the strong antioxidant activities of a chitosan

@highlight A long acting injectable anti glaucoma drug delivery system is rationally designed.
@highlight Multifunctional carriers are coloaded with pilocarpine RGFP966 for pharmacotherapy.
@highlight Single intracameral drug administration can mitigate glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
@highlight Methoxylation effect of benzoic acid derivative is key for formulation development.
