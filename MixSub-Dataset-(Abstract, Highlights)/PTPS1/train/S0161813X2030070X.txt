 Bisphenol A is an estrogenic chemical extensively used in industrial and household applications . The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of chronic exposure to BPA on the adult female neuroendocrine system . Herein we found that expose of adult female mice to BPA by oral gavage for 60 days prolonged diestrus and decreased serum 17 estradiol concentration by reducing the number of antral follicles and corpora luteum . In comparison with controls the levels of serum luteinizing hormone follicle stimulating hormone hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone and the expression of kisspeptin in anteroventral periventricular nucleus decreased in BPA mice which could be reversed by injecting kisspeptin 10 . Treatment with BPA or estrogen receptor antagonist MPP but not ER antagonist PHTPP inhibited E2 induced AVPV kisspeptin expression in ovariectomized mice . Use of ER agonist PPT rather than ER agonist DPN enhanced AVPV kisspepetin expression which decreased after treatment with BPA . The amplitude of the proestrus LH surge decreased in mice exposed to BPA but was recovered by administering kisspeptin 10 . The present study provides

@highlight Chronic exposure to BPA suppressed follicular maturation and ovulation.
@highlight BPA inhibited follicular growth by activating proapoptosis signal.
@highlight BPA inhibits the expression of ovarian hormones and gonadotropins.
@highlight BPA directly inhibits AVPV kisspeptin neuronal activity by activated ER.
@highlight BPA inhibits activity of the HPG axis by reducing kisspeptin expression.
