 A series of alkylphosphocholines with foscarnet moiety was synthesized . The structure of these zwitterionic amphiphiles was modified in both polar and non polar parts of surfactant molecule . Investigations of physicochemical properties are represented by the determination of critical micelle concentration the surface tension value at the cmc and the surface area per surfactant head group utilising surface tension measurements . Hydrodynamic diameter of surfactant micelles was determined using the dynamic light scattering technique . Alkylphosphocholines exhibit significant cytotoxic anticandidal

@highlight Compounds with inserted foscarnet moiety between alkyl chain and choline.
@highlight The highest anticandidal activity attained within the group of alkylphosphocholines.
@highlight Clinical isolates of Acanthamoeba spp. susceptible to alkylphosphocholines.
@highlight Relationship between critical micelle concentration and biological activity.
