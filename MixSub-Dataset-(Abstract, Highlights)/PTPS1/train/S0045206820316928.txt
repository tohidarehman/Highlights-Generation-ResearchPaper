 Novel 4 substituted quinazoline 2 carboxamide derivatives targeting AcrB were designed synthesized and evaluated for their biological activity as AcrB inhibitors . In particular the ability of the compounds to potentiate the activity of antibiotics to inhibit Nile Red efflux and to target AcrB was investigated . In this study 19 compounds were identified to reduce the MIC values of at least one tested antibacterial by 2 to 16 fold at a lower concentration . Identified modulating compounds also possessed considerable inhibition on Nile red efflux at concentrations as low as 50M and did not display off target effects on the outer membrane . Among the above compounds with characteristics of ideal AcrB inhibitors the most outstanding ones are
