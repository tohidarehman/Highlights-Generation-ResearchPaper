 The natural calcitonin receptor and its peptide agonists are considered validated targets for drug discovery . A small molecule agonist SUN B8155 has previously been shown to efficiently activate cellular CTR . Herein we report the synthesis of a series of compounds derived from SUN B8155 and investigate the structural functional relationship bias properties and their cellular activity profile . We discover that the

@highlight Analogues of SUN B8155 induced different Gs or arrestin activities through CTR.
@highlight  Hydroxyl group from the pyridone ring is required for G protein activity.
@highlight S8155 7 induces more Gs coupling whereas S8155 4 is arrestin 2 biased.
