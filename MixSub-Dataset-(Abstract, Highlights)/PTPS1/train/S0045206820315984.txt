 To check whether the endophytic fungus from the host plant could produce novel bioactive metabolites induced by the host derived chemical components a strategy called Induction of Endophyte Metabolism by Adding Host Components was put up and applied . Cultivation of the endophytic fungus

@highlight Ten Metabolites 
@highlight None
@highlight  were purified from the mangrove fungus
@highlight Seven new molecules include three chromones an isocoumarin two
@highlight  lactone and an oxepinone
@highlight Compounds
@highlight None
@highlight were fungal products by induction of the component of its host plant.
@highlight The test compounds showed potent antifungal effects on at least one plant pathogen.
