 The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 is a heat activated cation channel modulated by inflammatory mediators and contributes to acute and chronic pain . TRPV1 channel is one of the most researched and targeted mechanisms for the development of novel analgesics . Over the years natural products have contributed enormously to the development of important therapeutic drugs used currently in modern medicine . A literature review was conducted using Medline Google Scholar and PubMed . Searching the literature resulted in listing 136 natural compounds that interacted with TRPV1 channel . These compounds were phytochemicals that belong to different chemical groups including vanilloids flavonoids alkaloids terpenoids terpenyl phenols fatty acids cannabinoids sulfur containing compounds etc . Other natural TRPV1 modulators were of animal fungal or bacterial origin . Some natural products were small agonists or antagonists of TRPV1 . Others were protein venoms . Most in vitro studies utilized electrophysiological or calcium imaging techniques to study calcium flow through the channel using primary cultures of rat dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia . Other studies used hTRPV1 or rTRPV1 expressed in HEK239 CHO cells or

@highlight Searching the literature resulted in listing at least 136 natural modulators of TRPV1 channel.
@highlight Natural TRPV1 modulators were of plant animal fungal or bacterial origin.
@highlight Some natural products were small agonists or antagonists of TRPV1. Others were protein venoms.
@highlight Many gaps in natural product research are present in distinguishing modality specific from polymodal antagonists.
@highlight Species specific differences in TRPV1 functionality must be taken into account in any future study.
