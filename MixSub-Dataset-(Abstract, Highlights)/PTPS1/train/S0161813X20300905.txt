 Although environmental lead exposure has decreased several studies have shown that low level lead exposure can result in adverse psychological symptoms . However few studies have examined lead neurotoxicity in pregnant women . We investigated the association between lead exposure and psychological symptoms in pregnant women and between socio economic status and blood lead levels . Blood lead levels were measured in 17 267 pregnant women in the Japan Environment and Childrens Study . Odds ratios for high blood lead levels were calculated using multinomial logistic regression . Psychological symptoms were assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale . ORs for depression were calculated using logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders . The geometric mean of whole blood lead levels was 0.58g dl . Higher blood lead levels were associated with older age 1.462.19 unmarried status lower household income and lower educational attainment . The percentage of women with K6 scores 13 and 5 was 3 and 28.2 respectively . There was no significant association between lead exposure and K6 score . Our results indicate a small but significant association between higher blood lead levels and lower socio economic status in a population with low blood lead levels but no association between low level lead exposure and psychological symptoms .
