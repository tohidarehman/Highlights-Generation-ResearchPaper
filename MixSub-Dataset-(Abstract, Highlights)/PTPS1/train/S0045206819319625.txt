 Leishmaniasis has affected a wider part of population around the globe . Most often the existing regiments to battle against leishmaniasis are inadequate and limited . In our ongoing efforts to develop new leishmanicidal agents we have synthesized a series of novel and symmetrical bis Schiff base disulfide hybrids
