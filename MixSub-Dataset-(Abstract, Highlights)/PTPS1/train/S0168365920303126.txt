 With the emergence of drug resistant bacteria conventional antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective for the treatment of bacterial infections . Nanomaterial modified antibiotics denoted as nanoantibiotics can usually circumvent most of the shortcomings of conventional antibiotics thus improving antibacterial activities . Here we developed triclosan based supramolecular hydrogel nanoantibiotics by conjugating small molecule antibiotic triclosan to self assembling peptides . The resultant nanoantibiotics presented many beneficial characteristics a stable three dimensional nanofiber structure increased TCS solubility by 850 fold acid responsive TCS release favorable biocompatibility . In consequence the nanoantibiotics showed potent

@highlight A triclosan based supramolecular hydrogel was developed as a novel nanoantibiotic.
@highlight The solubility of triclosan was increased after the self assemble into the hydrogel.
@highlight The release of triclosan showed acid responsiveness of bacterial infection sites.
@highlight The nanoantibiotic exhibited enhanced broad spectrum antibacterial activities.
@highlight It represents a new way to load TCS into hydrogels for antibacterial applications.
