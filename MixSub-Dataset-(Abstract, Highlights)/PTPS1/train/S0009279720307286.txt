 The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of imatinib mesylate a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a well known anticancer with numerous medical benefits on blood sugar levels insulin and glucagon secretion in an experimental model of STZ induced diabetes mellitus . Type 1 diabetes mellitus was induced by a single I.P . injection of Streptozotocin in male Sprague Dawley rats . Daily oral imatinib and for 4 weeks induced a significant attenuation in signs of DM in rats reflected in their assessed lab values . Biomarkers of cell injury tissue necrosis and apoptosis caspase 3 were significantly reduced with imatinib treatment . Furthermore pancreatic antioxidants defenses of which superoxide dismutase and catalase activities reduced glutathione concentration and total antioxidant capacity have significantly improved with a simultaneous reduction in malondialdehyde content . Histopathologically imatinib treatment was associated with a minimal pancreatic injury and marked restoration of insulin content in cells . Moreover imatinib treatment revealed a significant reduction in the infiltration of macrophages in cells . Imatinib s ameliorative impact on DM may be attributed to it s mediated protection and preservation of pancreatic cells function and the improvement in serum insulin levels and hence the improvement of blood glucose and overall glycemic control .

@highlight Imatinib improved DM indices in an experimental model of STZ induced T1DM.
@highlight Imatinib showed preservation of morphological characteristics of pancreatic cells.
@highlight Imatinib alleviated oxidative stress associating T1DM.
@highlight Imatinib exerted anti inflammatory and anti apoptotic properties.
