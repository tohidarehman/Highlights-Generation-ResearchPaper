 Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder affecting nearly 6570 million people worldwide . Despite the observed advances in the development of new antiepileptic drugs still about 3040 of patients can not achieve a satisfactory seizure control . In our current research we aimed at using the combined results of radioligand binding experiments PAMPA BBB assay and animal experimentations in order to design a group of compounds that exhibit broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity . The synthesized 4 alkyl 5 substituted 1 2 4 triazole 3 thione derivatives were primarily screened in the maximal electroshock induced seizure test in mice . Next the most promising compounds

@highlight The obtained compounds were identified as sodium channel blockers.
@highlight PAMPA BBB assay confirmed their good permeability across the blood brain barrier.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight were highly active in MES and 6Hz tests.
@highlight Compounds
@highlight and
@highlight possessed favourable ADME Tox properties.
