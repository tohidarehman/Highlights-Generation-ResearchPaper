 Coumaric acid is a known inhibitor of tyrosinase an enzyme involved in the initial steps of the melanin synthesis in human and other species . However its low lipophilicity impairs its penetration through skin and efficacy as antimelanogenic agent indeed . Accordingly this paper reports the assessment of several coumaric acid derivatives as tyrosinase inhibitors and antimelanogenic agents in

@highlight The
@highlight  coumaric acid esters are inhibitors of tyrosinase.
@highlight The antimelanogenic activity is independent of radical scavenging effect.
@highlight The compounds are effective antimelanogenic agents in human skin.
@highlight Molecular modelling studies reinforces the activity of the intact esters.
