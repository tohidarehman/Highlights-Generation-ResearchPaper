 Black phosphorus nanosheets a kind of attractive two dimensional materials have been widely used in optoelectronics transistors and photocatalysis . Recently growing interest has been attracted to explore the application of BP NSs for cancer therapy in view of their unique properties . BP NSs have high surface area and negative charge which can load drug targeting molecules photosensitizer magnetic nanoparticles

@highlight We reviewed functional black phosphorus nanosheets for cancer therapy.
@highlight The exfoliation methods and properties of black phosphorus nanosheets were introduced.
@highlight The different kinds of delivery systems based on black phosphorus nanosheets for cancer therapy were reviewed in detail.
