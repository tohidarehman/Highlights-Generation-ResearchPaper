 The apparent predicament of the representative chemotherapy for managing respiratory distress calls for an obligatory deliberation for identifying the pharmaceuticals that effectively counter the contemporary intricacies associated with target disease . Multiple complex regulatory pathways manifest chronic pulmonary disorders which require chemotherapeutics that produce composite inhibitory effect . The cost effective natural product based molecules hold a high fervor to meet the prospects posed by current respiratory distress therapy by sparing the tedious drug design and development archetypes present a robust standing for the possible replacement of the fading practice of poly pharmacology and ensure the subversion of a potential disease relapse . This study summarizes the experimental evidences on natural products moieties and their components that illustrates therapeutic efficacy on respiratory disorders .
