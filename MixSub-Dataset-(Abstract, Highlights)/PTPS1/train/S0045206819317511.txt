 A new series of novel nonquaternary conjugates and non oxime reactivators for reactivation of both nerve agents and pesticides inhibited hAChE were described in this paper . Conjugates with piperazine linked to the substituted salicylaldoxime emerged as efficient reactivators for VX inhibited hAChE . The

@highlight Novel nonquaternary reactivators for organophosphate inhibited hAChE were constructed.
@highlight Some salicylaldoxime conjugates emerged as efficient reactivators.
@highlight Some non oxime derivatives displayed obvious reactivation potency.
