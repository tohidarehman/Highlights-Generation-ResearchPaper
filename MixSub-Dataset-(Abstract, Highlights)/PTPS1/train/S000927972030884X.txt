 The lack of tissue selectivity of anticancer drugs generates intense collateral and adverse effects of cancer patients making the incorporation of vitamins or micronutrients into the diet of individuals to reduce side or adverse effects of antineoplastics . The study aimed to evaluate the effects of retinol palmitate on the toxicogenic damages induced by cyclophosphamide doxorubicin and its association with the AC protocol in Sarcoma 180 tumor cell line using the micronuclei test with a block of cytokinesis and in non tumor cells derived from Mus musculus using the comet assay . The results suggest that CPA DOX and AC protocol induced significant toxicogenic damages on the S 180cells by induction of micronuclei cytoplasmic bridges nuclear buds apoptosis and cell necrosis proving their antitumor effects and significant damage to the genetic material of peripheral blood cells of healthy mice proving the genotoxic potential of these drugs . However RP modulated the toxicogenic effects of antineoplastic tested both in the CBMN test at the concentrations of 1 10 and 100 IU mL as in the comet assay at the concentration of 100 IU kg for the index and frequency of genotoxic damage . The accumulated results suggest that RP reduced the action of antineoplastics in non tumor cells as well as the cytotoxic mutagenic and cell death in neoplastic cells .
