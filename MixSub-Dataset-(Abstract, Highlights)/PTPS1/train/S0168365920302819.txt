 Despite advances in photodynamic therapy for treating superficial tumor the prospect of this monotherapy remains challenges in the context of systemic phototoxicity and poor efficacy . In this work a physiologically self degradable microneedle assisted platform is developed for combining PDT and immunotherapy

@highlight Microneedles were integrated with pH responsive nanovesicles.
@highlight Hydrophobic photosensitizer and hydrophilic anti CTLA4 antibody were co encapsulated into nanovesicles.
@highlight Microneedle assisted co delivery platform showed combined photodynamic immunotherapy for focal tumor.
