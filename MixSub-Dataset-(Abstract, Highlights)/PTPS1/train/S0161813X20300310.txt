 Botulinum toxin A is a potent neurotoxin that acts primarily by silencing synaptic transmission by blocking neurotransmitter release . BoNT A comprises a light chain intracellular protease and a heavy chain composed of a receptor binding domain HC

@highlight Full length catalytically inactive BoNT A 0 enters neurons by at least two routes.
@highlight Internalised BoNT A 0 traffics to early endosomes.
@highlight A proportion of internalised BoNT A remains stable in neurons for 3 days.
@highlight Endocytosed full length BoNT A 0 can exit the cell to intoxicate other neurons.
