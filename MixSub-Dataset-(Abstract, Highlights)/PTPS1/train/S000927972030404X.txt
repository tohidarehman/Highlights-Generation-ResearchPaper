 Inhibition of mouse double minute 2 homolog p53 interaction and reactivation of p53 signaling have been explored as effective anticancer therapeutic strategy . The potent and specific antitumor activity shown by Nutlins first class of MDM2 p53 inhibitors discovered has made these compounds potential antitumor candidates . To this end we synthesized Nutlin 1 and Nutlin 2 analogs through molecular simplification and selected the compound with the most efficient antitumoral activity . Cytotoxicity of Nutlin 2 analog LQFM126 on B16F10 melanoma cells induced intense cytoplasmic vacuolization reduction of cell size chromatin condensation cytoplasmic degeneration and nuclear fragmentation . LQFM126 antiproliferative effects mediated cell cycle retention in G

@highlight A new piperazine compound was obtained through molecular simplification of Nutlins.
@highlight LQFM126 prototype promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in melanoma cells.
@highlight LQFM126 has shown low estimated toxicity and
@highlight antiangiogenic activity.
