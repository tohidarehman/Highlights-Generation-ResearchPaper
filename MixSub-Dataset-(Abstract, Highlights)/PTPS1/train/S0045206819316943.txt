 We present a new efficient green synthetic protocol for introduction of substituents to the C 6 position of 2 arylbenzothiazole nuclei . Newly synthesized compounds were designed to study the influence of the hydroxy and methoxy groups on the 2 arylbenzothiazole scaffold as well as the influence of the type of substituents placed on the C 6 position of benzothiazole moiety on biological activity including antibacterial antitumor and antioxidant activity . Modest activity was observed against the tested Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains for only amidino derivatives
