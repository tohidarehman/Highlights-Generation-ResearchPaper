 The non modified nanocarriers based therapies for the treatment of cancer and other infectious diseases enhanced the chemical stability of therapeutically active agents protected them from enzymatic degradation and extended their blood circulation time . However the lack of specificity and off target effects limit their applications . Mannose receptors overexpressed on antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages are one of the most desirable targets for treating cancer and other infectious diseases . Therefore the development of mannosylated nanocarrier formulation is one of the most extensively explored approaches for targeting these mannose receptors .

@highlight Surface modified nanocarriers are promising to overcome the lack of specificity and off target effects of conventional nanocarriers.
@highlight Targeting the mannose receptors through the development of mannosylated nanocarriers is one of the most extensively studied approaches for the treatment of cancer and other infectious diseases.
@highlight Manuscript initially provides the introduction to C type lectin receptors and their structural and binding properties. It covers the expression distribution and roles of mannose receptors.
@highlight It provides a detailed account of different mannosylated nanocarrier formulations.
@highlight Mannosylated nanocarriers depicted site specific targeting enhanced pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profiles and improved transfection efficiency of the drug.
