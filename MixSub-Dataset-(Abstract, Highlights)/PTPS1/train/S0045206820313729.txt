 Poly polymerase 1 a widely explored anticancer drug target plays an important role in single strand DNA break repair processes . High throughput virtual screening of a Maybridge small molecule library using the PARP1 benzimidazole 4 carboxamide co crystal structure and pharmacophore model led to the identification of eleven compounds . These compounds were evaluated using recombinant PARP1 enzyme assay that resulted in the acquisition of three PARP1 inhibitors
