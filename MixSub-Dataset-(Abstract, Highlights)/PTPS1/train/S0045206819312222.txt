 Studies on the substrate selectivity of recombinant ferrous iron and 2 oxoglutarate dependent proline hydroxylases reveal that they can catalyse the production of dihydroxylated 5 6 and 7 membered ring products and can accept bicyclic substrates . Ring substituted substrate analogues are accepted in some cases . The results highlight the considerable as yet largely untapped potential for amino acid hydroxylases and other 2OG oxygenases in biocatalysis .
