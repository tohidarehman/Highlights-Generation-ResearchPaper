 We investigated the inhibitory effects of 13 organophosphate esters and hydrolytic metabolites on the carboxylesterase activity of rat liver microsomes

@highlight We examined carboxylesterase inhibition by organophosphate esters OPEs .
@highlight 2 Ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate was the most potent inhibitor among tested OPEs.
@highlight Aryl OPEs were strong rat liver microsomal carboxylesterase inhibitors.
@highlight Di or mono substituted derivatives of OPEs showed markedly decreased inhibition.
@highlight OPEs bearing a bulky substituent showed greater carboxylesterase inhibitory effects.
