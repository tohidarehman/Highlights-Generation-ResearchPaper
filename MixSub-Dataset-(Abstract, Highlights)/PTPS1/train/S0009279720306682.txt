 The caseinate and glycated caseinate generated from the transglutaminase catalyzed reaction of caseinate and oligochitosan were digested using pepsin and trypsin and the activity of the resultant digests was measured in rat intestinal epithelial cell line using several biological responses as indicators . Compared with the caseinate digest the glycated caseinate digest had similar contents in 17 amino acids but less reactable NH

@highlight IEC 6cells show responses to both glycated caseinate digest and caseinate digest.
@highlight They promote cell growth and accumulate cell cycle progression at the S phase.
@highlight They also possess apoptosis prevention and differentiation activity to the cells.
@highlight Glycated caseinate digest has enhanced activity due to the TGase type glycation.
@highlight The enhanced activity is regulated via the Wnt catenin signaling pathway.
