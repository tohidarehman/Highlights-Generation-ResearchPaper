 Medicinal importance of the sulfonylhydrazones is well evident owing to their binding ability with zinc containing metalloenzymes . In the present study we have synthesized different series of sulfonylhydrazones by using facile synthetic methods in good to excellent yield . All the successfully prepared sulfonylhydrazones were screened for ectonucleotidase inhibitory activity . Among the chromen 2 one scaffold based sulfonylhydrazones the compounds
