 Thermosensitive liposomes as one of the stimuli responsive drug delivery systems receive growing attention due to their ability to generate rapid and massive drug release in the heated area and marginal release of contents in non heated parts of the body . This typical triggered release behavior can not be fitted adequately by most of the current mathematical kinetic models . The aim of this study was to establish the proper kinetic equation to describe the rapid release of drugs from trigger sensitive drug delivery systems . We summarized all commonly used kinetic models mentioned in the literature and fitted the release data with these models finding that only the Korsmeyer Peppas and the Weibull models show acceptable fitting results . To better describe the release from thermosensitive liposomes with a size below 100nm we took Laplace pressure as a release driving force and proposed a new equation that demonstrates improved fitting in liposomes ranging down to a size of 70nm . Our new kinetic model shows desirable fitting not only at the optimal temperature but also of releases within the whole release temperature range providing a useful kinetic model to describe release profiles of smaller nano sized stimuli responsive drug delivery systems .

@highlight Thermosensistive liposomes TSL show a parabola shape like release curve at Tm.
@highlight First order kinetic model cannot fit the release at Tm of TSL properly.
@highlight Weibull model can be used to fit the release from TSL at Tm.
@highlight A new established model improves the goodness of fit of TSL release at Tm.
