 Cysteine proteases are involved in a myriad of actions that include not only protein degradation but also play an essential biological role in infectious and systemic diseases such as cancer . CPs also act as biomarkers and can be reached by active based probes for diagnostic and mechanistic purposes that are critical in health and disease . In this paper we present the modulation of a CP panel of parasites and mammals
