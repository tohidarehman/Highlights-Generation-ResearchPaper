 The European Joint Program HBM4EU is a joint effort of 30 countries and the European Environment Agency co funded under the European Commission s Horizon 2020 program for advancing and implementing human biomonitoring on a European scale and for providing scientific evidence for chemical policy making . One important outcome will be a Europe wide improvement and harmonization of health risk assessment following the coordinated derivation or update of health related guidance values referring to the internal body burden . These guidance values named HBM guidance values or HBM GVs can directly be compared with HBM data . They are derived within HBM4EU for priority substances identified by the HBM4EU chemicals prioritization strategy based on existing needs to answer policy relevant questions as raised by national and EU policy makers . HBM GVs refer to both the general population and occupationally exposed adults . Reports including the detailed reasoning for the values proposals are subjected to a consultation process within all partner countries of the consortium to reach a broad scientific consensus on the derivation approach and on the derived values . The final HBM GVs should be applied first within the HBM4EU project but may also be useful for regulators and risk assessors outside this project . The subsequent adoption of derived HBM GVs at EU level needs to be discussed and decided within the responsible EU bodies . Nevertheless the establishment of HBM GVs as part of HBM4EU is already a step forward in strengthening HBM based policy efforts for public and occupational health .
