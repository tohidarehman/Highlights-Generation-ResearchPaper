 In 2017 there were large increases in overdose deaths among women in the United States across age groups . In addition U.S. women who inject drugs are at increased risk for substance use related disease transmission bacterial infections as well as sexual and physical violence compared to men who inject drugs . Relatedly women face unique access barriers to substance use related services such as stigma and low coverage of gender specific drug use related services . Despite these heightened risks experienced by WWID interventions specifically tailored to preventing women from transitioning into injection drug use have not been developed to date . As such we advocate for the development of gender responsive programs to prevent injection drug use initiation . This is critical to ensuring a comprehensive approach to preventing injection drug use initiation among those populations at highest risk of injection related morbidity and mortality .
