 Globally research on the co infection of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus among people who inject drugs is growing . However studies in resource poor countries remain limited . Therefore we conducted this study to explore factors associated with HIV HCV co infection among people who inject drugs in Cambodia . This national survey was conducted in 2017 in the capital city and 11 provinces . We used a peer based social network recruitment method to recruit 286 participants for face to face interviews and HIV and HCV testing . A modified Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify risk factors associated with HIV HCV co infection . The prevalence of HIV and HCV was 15.4 and 30.4 respectively . Of the total 9.4 of the participants were HIV HCV co infected and 61.4 of the HIV infected participants were co infected with HCV . About half of the participants tested HIV positive were aware of their HIV status of whom 83.3 were on antiretroviral therapy . Only 11.5 of the participants with HCV antibody positivity were aware of their HCV infection status of whom 50.0 were on HCV treatment . The adjusted prevalence ratio of HIV HCV co infection was significantly higher among women than among men and among participants who lived on the streets than among those living with their family or relatives . The APR of HIV HCV co infection was also significantly higher among participants who had received methadone maintenance therapy than those who had not received it . The prevalence of HIV HCV co infection among people who inject drugs in Cambodia was considerably high . Intervention programs are required to increase access to harm reduction interventions among most marginalized people who inject drugs to prevent HIV and HCV infection . HCV screening services should be expanded in this key population given its small population size and the availability of directly acting antiviral agents in the country .

@highlight In Cambodia HIV HCV co infection has gained limited policy and strategic attention.
@highlight One tenth of the people who inject drugs in this study were HIV HCV co infected.
@highlight Risk factors for HIV HCV co infection included being female and living on the streets.
@highlight Interventions should be gender sensitive targeting more marginalized sub populations.
@highlight HCV screening should be expanded given the availability of effective treatment.
