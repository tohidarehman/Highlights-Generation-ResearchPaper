 The Korean government implemented partial smoke free regulations in hospitality venues 150m Data from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey II a nationally representative cross sectional study were used . In total 4218 non smoking adults were selected based on questionnaires and urinary cotinine concentrations . Linear trend tests of urinary cotinine over time and socio demographic factors associated with urinary cotinine in 2014 were examined based on weighted linear regression models . Overall the covariate adjusted least square geometric mean concentrations of urinary cotinine were 2.95g g creatinine in 2012 1.54g g Cr in 2013 and 1.47g g Cr in 2014 a significant decrease during 20122014 . Urinary cotinine concentrations decreased significantly during 20122014 in most socio demographic subgroups . However concentrations in adults who worked in hospitality venues including restaurants bars cafes fast food franchises and bakeries remained unchanged . Data from 2014 when smoke free regulations were implemented in hospitality venues 100m Overall urinary cotinine concentrations of Korean non smoking adults decreased during 20122014 . However implementation of partial smoke free regulations in hospitality venues was not effective in reducing secondhand smoke exposure in workers at hospitality venues .

@highlight Korea implemented partial smoke free regulations in hospitality venues 150 m
@highlight in 2013 and 100 m
@highlight in 2014.
@highlight Korea representative data showed overall urinary cotinine concentrations in non smoking adults decreased during 20122014.
@highlight Urinary cotinine concentrations in adults working in hospitality venues remained unchanged.
@highlight In 2014 cotinine concentrations were significantly higher in adults working in hospitality venues than in unemployed adults.
@highlight The limited effectiveness of partial regulations in hospitality venues calls for implementation of comprehensive regulations.
