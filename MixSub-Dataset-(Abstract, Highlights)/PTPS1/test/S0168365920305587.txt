 Treatments of neurodegenerative diseases are severely hampered by the presence of the blood brain barrier precluding efficient brain drug delivery . The development of drug nanocarriers aims at increasing the brain therapeutic index would represent a real progress in brain disease management . PEGylated polyester nanoparticles are intensively tested in clinical trials for improved drug delivery . Our working hypothesis was that some surface parameters and size of NPs could favor their penetration across the BBB and their neuronal uptake . Polymeric material PEG

@highlight PEGylated non targeted NPs were studied for brain drug delivery.
@highlight  NPs transcytosis rate was not controlled by surface chemistry and size.
@highlight Zebrafish larvae permitted to model NPs distribution interaction with blood vessels.
@highlight NPs PEG chain surface density plays a role in particle distribution.
