 Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition is a natural and reversible process involved in embryogenesis wound healing and thought to participate in the process of metastasis . Multiple signals from the microenvironment have been reported to drive EMT . However the tight control of this process on physiological scenarios and how it is disrupted during cancer progression is not fully understood . Here we analysed a regulatory network of EMT accounting for 10 key microenvironment signals focusing on the impact of two cell contact signals on the reversibility of EMT and the stability of resulting phenotypes . The analysis showed that the microenvironment is not enough for stabilizing Hybrid and Amoeboid like phenotypes requiring intracellular de regulations as reported during cancer progression . Our simulations demonstrated that RPTP activation by cell contacts have the potential to inhibit the process of EMT and trigger its reversibility under tissue growth and chronic inflammation scenarios . Simulations also showed that hypoxia inhibits the capacity of RPTPs to control EMT . Our analysis further provided a theoretical explanation for the observed correlation between hypoxia and metastasis under chronic inflammation and predicted that de regulations in FAT4 signalling may promote Hybrid stabilization . Taken together we propose a natural control mechanism of EMT that supports the idea that EMT is tightly regulated by the microenvironment .
