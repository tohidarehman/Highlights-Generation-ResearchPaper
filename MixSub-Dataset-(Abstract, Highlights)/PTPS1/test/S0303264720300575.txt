 This is a review of recent work on how the physics of evolution accounts for the origin changes and future of social systems . Evolution means the changes that happen with discernible direction in time . Changes are everywhere because physical features of freedom to change are in every moving and flowing system . With freedom comes evolution and with evolution come all these visible things movement change configurations diversity multiple scales and the universality of social organization phenomena such as human settlements hierarchy economics economies of scale and diminishing returns .

@highlight Review of the physics of evolution regarding the origin changes and future of social systems.

@highlight From freedom and evolution come all physical features of social organization phenomena.
@highlight Features treated in detail are movement change configuration diversity hierarchy economics and diminishing returns.
