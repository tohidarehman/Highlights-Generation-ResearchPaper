 Manganese is an essential element diet being its main source . Some epidemiological studies have found that a prenatal excess of Mn could negatively affect neuropsychological development during infancy but the evidence is inconclusive . The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal serum Mn concentrations and child neuropsychological development assessed at 1 year of age . study subjects were 1179 motherchild pairs from two Spanish cohorts of the INMA Project . Mn was measured in serum samples collected during the first trimester of pregnancy . Child neuropsychological development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development composed of both mental and psychomotor scales . Sociodemographic lifestyle and dietary information was collected through questionnaires during pregnancy and during the child s first year of life . Serum Mn was log 2 transformed . Multivariable linear regression models were built . Generalized additive models were used to assess the shape of the relation between prenatal exposure to Mn and the neuropsychological test scores . geometric mean and 95 confidence interval of maternal serum Mn was 1.50 g L. Levels of Mn were higher among non working mothers and in those with a higher consumption of nuts . The association between maternal Mn levels and child neuropsychological development was negative in the multivariable models for the mental 0.39 and psychomotor scales 0.92 although the coefficients were not statistically significant . The best shape describing the relationship between Mn and the Bayley scales was linear in both cases . This study shows a null association between maternal prenatal levels of Mn and neuropsychological development at one year after birth in two cohorts within the INMA study .

@highlight Prenatal Mn levels did not associate with neuropsychological development during the first year.
@highlight Maternal iron status and the child s sex did not modify the Mn effect.
@highlight Consumption of nuts was the only dietary factor associated with maternal Mn levels.
