 Hand hygiene is an efficacious behaviour to prevent community associated infections . Estimates of the proportion of populations who wash their hands have indicated limited compliance . While biases of self report items for hand hygiene such as the tendency to overestimate one s behaviour represent a limitation direct survey questions remain important . This study aims to compare indices of handwashing compliance based on single vs. combined handwashing attributes i.e . its frequency technique and duration . Data of a representative survey on hygiene and infection control by the German Federal Centre for Health Education were analysed . In a cross sectional computer assisted telephone interview design the resident population in Germany aged 1685 years was surveyed in 2012 . For handwashing duration frequency in different situations and technique were self reported . Self reports were rated as compliant based on national recommendations and combined into single and multi attribute indices . Use of hand disinfectants recall of handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms and socio demographics were also assessed . In total N 4483 persons participated . Data were weighted to compensate for sampling bias and analysed by cross tabulation and multiple logistic regression . Primarily due to missing data the analysis was confined to N 4093 respondents . Among women the proportion of those who reported to wash hands almost always in at least seven of nine situations was 30.8 . In contrast 51 of men reported always using soap drying hands and washing interdigital spaces . Compliance based on indices that included frequency was higher in women by 5.2 for frequency technique and 2.5 for frequency duration and frequency duration technique . Socio demographic differences were most consistent regarding higher compliance among healthcare workers . Finally especially men recalling handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms had higher compliance than those with no recall namely for frequency technique all three attributes and technique . The highest odds ratio was noted for disinfectant use among men . While being representative for Germany limitations include the survey s cross sectionality response rate and the study representing the situation in 2012 . Nonetheless indices based on combined attributes allow better comparison to scarce compliance estimates for Germany based on observation . Socio demographic differences add to existing evidence e.g . higher compliance by healthcare workers . Finally although reverse causation is possible it is notable that although handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms focus on duration and technique women recalling them reported higher frequency and men more often report hand disinfectant use suggesting possible carry over effects . Self reported handwashing compliance assessment may be improved by partitioning the behavioural domain into different attributes and using indices based on combinations of these .

@highlight As population handwashing compliance remains sub optimal self report measures remain useful despite over reporting biases.
@highlight Self report indices based on combinations of different behavioral attributes may improve self report measures.
@highlight Combined indices of frequency technique and duration come closer to observation based estimations than single indicators.
@highlight Among socio demographic characteristics working in healthcare has most consistent positive associations with handwashing.
@highlight Associations of recalling handwashing instruction with handwashing frequency and disinfectant use suggest carry over effects.
