 Emerging evidence suggests close domestic proximity of livestock and humans may lead to microbiological contamination of hands objects food and water supplies within domestic environments adversely impacting public health . However evidence quantifying the relationship between livestock domestic animals humans and microbiological contamination of household stored water remains limited . This longitudinal study aimed to examine the relationship between domestic contact with livestock and domestic animals on microbiological contamination of household Point of Use stored drinking water in rural Kenya and assess the influence of choice of faecal indicator on such associations . A survey was performed in 234 households in Siaya county Kenya to observe presence of livestock and domestic animals in household compounds alongside other risk factors for contamination of POU stored drinking water such as sanitation storage conditions and hygiene practices . Samples from water sources and from POU storage containers were tested for Rainwater was the main POU water source and was found to be highly susceptible to contamination . Multivariate analysis showed greater risk of gross water contamination and poultry within household compounds increases POU water contamination risk suggesting the need for improved interventions to address cross contamination within rural domestic settings . Within Siaya county more effective community education is needed to raise awareness of POU water quality protection particularly of rainwater .
