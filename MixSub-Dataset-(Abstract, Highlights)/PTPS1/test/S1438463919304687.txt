 New Jersey residents in some areas may be exposed to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances due to PFAS contamination of public drinking water . This contamination stems from industrial discharges and the use of aqueous film foaming foams at military bases and commercial airports for drills and locations where fires occurred . Exposure to PFAS has raised significant public health concerns due to its persistence both in the environment and human body . The potential toxicity of these chemicals may pose risks to human health . Statewide biomonitoring data is needed to establish a baseline of exposure and to identify the subpopulations at risk . The NJ Department of Health conducted a statewide NJ Biomonitoring study for PFAS utilizing a cost effective sampling approach i.e . acquiring remnant sera from both clinical laboratories and blood banks across NJ . This convenience sampling approach was adopted as an alternative to a costly and labor intensive probability based population sampling . One thousand and thirty human sera were collected from NJ adults between 20 and 74 years of age from 2016 to 2018 with additional information of county sex and age . The serum collection was demographically and geographically dispersed across four seasons . Twelve PFAS analytes were measured for the specimens collected . The data were post stratified by county sex and age groups . Stratified individual sample weights were developed and used to estimate population means compare least squared mean differences and examine contributing variables . Geometric means and percentiles with 95 confidence intervals of the target analytes are presented providing preliminary baselines of the statewide PFAS exposure for NJ adults . PFOA PFNA PFHxS and PFOS were selected for in depth analyses because their GMs were greater than 0.5ng mL and they were detected over 99 in study population . Subjects from this study had higher serum levels of PFOA PFNA and PFHxS compared to the general U.S. population reported by the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey . However the distributions of PFOA PFNA PFHxS and PFOS across sex and age groups were consistent with the patterns found in NHANES i.e . all differed by sex and age group . Further sex and age stratification showed significantly lower concentrations of the 4 analytes in younger females than in older females and males . Future research is needed to identify PFAS exposure sources and to develop effective intervention strategies . Continuing PFAS biomonitoring using population sampling is recommended for tracking trends and better identifying subpopulations at risk .

@highlight This study provides preliminary statewide biomonitoring data of PFAS for NJ adults.
@highlight New Jersey adults had higher PFOA PFNA and PFHxS levels than US adults.
@highlight PFAS levels varied by sex and age notably lower levels in females 2059 .
