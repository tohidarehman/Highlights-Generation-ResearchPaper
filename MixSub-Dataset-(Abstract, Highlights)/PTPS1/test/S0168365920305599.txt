 The blood brain barrier prevents the permeability of drugs into the brain and as such limits the management of various brain diseases . To overcome this barrier drug encapsulating nanoparticles or vesicles drug conjugates and other types of drug delivery systems have been developed . However the brain targeting ability of nanoparticles or vesicles is still insufficient . Recently among the various brain targeting ligands previously studied for facilitating transcellular BBB transport several sugar appended nanocarriers for brain delivery were identified . Meanwhile cyclodextrins have been used as nanocarriers for drug delivery since they can encapsulate hydrophobic compounds with high biocompatibility . Therefore in this study we created various sugar appended cyclodextrins to discover novel brain targeting ligands . As a result of the six sugar appended CyDs lactose appended CyD showed greater cellular uptake in hCMEC D3 cells human brain microvascular endothelial cells than other sugar appended CyDs did . In addition the permeability of Lac CyD within the

Thus Lac CyD efficiently facilitated the accumulation of the model drug into the mouse brain. These findings suggest that Lac CyD has the potential to be a novel carrier for drugs across the BBB.
