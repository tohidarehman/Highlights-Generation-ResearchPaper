 Drug checking services aim to provide people who use drugs with information on the content and purity of their substances as a harm reduction intervention . The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between injecting alone and use of drug checking services in Vancouver Canada . Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of people who inject drugs . We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to estimate the effect of injecting alone on use of drug checking services . Between May 2018 and December 2018 a total of 793 people who inject drugs were included in the study 579 reported injecting alone and 177 reported use of drug checking services . In a multivariable model adjusted for various confounders injecting alone was negatively associated with use of drug checking services . We observed a negative association between injecting drugs alone and use of drug checking services which may be due in part to a number of exogenous factors that prevent people who inject alone from accessing drug checking services . As these individuals are at heightened risk of experiencing overdoses there is a need to pursue other strategies to reach this group of people who use drugs .

@highlight We conducted logistic regression analysis to estimate the effect of injecting alone on use of drug checking services.
@highlight People who inject alone are less likely to use drug checking services.
