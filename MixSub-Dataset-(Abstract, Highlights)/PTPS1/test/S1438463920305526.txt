 Residential greenness may prevent overweight obesity but the matter has not been investigated among middle aged and older adults in China . This study 1 assessed associations between residential greenness and markers of adiposity among middle aged and older Chinese adults and 2 investigated physical activity sedentary behaviours particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5m between 2007 and 2010 . Overweight obesity and abdominal obesity were measured by body mass index and waist circumference . Exposure to neighbourhood greenness was measured by the normalized difference vegetation index . Multilevel structural equation models were fitted to investigate the associations between neighbourhood greenness the four potential mediators and the prevalence of overweight obesity and central obesity . The results showed that greenness was inversely associated with the odds of overweight obesity 0.580.92 and abdominal adiposity . The greenness overweight obesity association varied significantly by sex and age and the greenness central obesity varied significantly by sex age and education . We found some indication that PM Exposure to higher levels of residential greenness was associated with lower odds of overweight obesity and abdominal obesity among middle aged and older Chinese adults . However underlying mechanisms explaining these associations remain unclear requiring longitudinal studies and natural experiments .

@highlight Greenness was inversely associated with the odds of overweight obesity and abdominal obesity.

@highlight concentrations had a suppressive effect on the greenness adiposity associations.
@highlight Physical activity sedentary behaviours or perennial mean temperature do not mediate the associations.
@highlight Sex age and education significantly modified the associations.
