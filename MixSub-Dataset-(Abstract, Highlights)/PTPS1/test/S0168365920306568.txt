 Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative disease involving numerous joint tissues and cells with a growing rate in prevalence that ultimately results in a negative social impact . Early diagnosis OA progression monitoring and effective treatment are of significant importance in halting OA process . However traditional imaging techniques lack sensitivity and specificity which lead to a delay in timely clinical intervention . Additionally current treatments only slow the progression of OA but have not meet the largely medical need for disease modifying therapy . In order to overcome the above mentioned problems and improve clinical efficacy nanotheranostics has been proposed on OA remedy which has confirmed success in animal models . In this review different imaging targets based nanoprobe for early and timely OA diagnosis is first discussed . Second therapeutic strategies delivered by nanosystem are summarized as much as possible . Their advantages and the potential for clinical translation are detailed discussed . Third nanomedicine simultaneously combined with the imaging for OA treatment is introduced . Nanotheranostics dynamically tracked the OA treatment outcomes to timely and individually adjust therapy . Finally future prospects and challenges of nanotechnology based OA diagnosis imaging and treatment are concluded and predicted . It is believed that nanoprobe and nanomedicine will become prospective in OA therapeutic revolution .
