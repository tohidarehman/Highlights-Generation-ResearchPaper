 To evaluate the association between potential exposure to different pollen concentrations at the 11th fetal week and subsequent clinical atopic diseases . Parents of 1 to 4 year old children returned a questionnaire regarding physician diagnosed atopic diseases . The children were born between 2001 and 2005 in the province of South Karelia Finland . Results of allergy tests were collected from patient records in the area . The prevalence of atopic diseases with sensitisation was higher in children whose 11th fetal week occurred during pollen rather than non pollen season atopic eczema 6.3 vs. 4.3 food allergy 5.7 vs. 3.9 respiratory allergy or asthma 3.7 vs. 2.2 and any atopic diseases 7.4 vs. 5.5 respectively . Respectively the prevalence was higher in the children exposed to high rather than low tree pollen concentrations 1000 vs. 10 particles m Coincidence of potential exposure to high tree pollen concentrations at the 11th fetal week is associated with subsequent clinical atopic diseases with sensitisation .

@highlight Pollen season at the end of the first trimester may increase the occurrence of atopy.
@highlight Early prenatal exposure to high tree pollen concentrations is a risk factor to atopy.
@highlight Early prenatal pollen exposure may deviate immune response towards allergic phenotype.
