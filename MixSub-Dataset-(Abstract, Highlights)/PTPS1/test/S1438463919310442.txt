 Diarrhoeal disease is common and imposes substantial health and economic burdens across the globe especially in the African and Southeast Asian regions . Besides causing high mortality and morbidity diarrhoeal disease has also been associated with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children in low resource settings . Extreme weather events brought about by climate change may increase diarrhoeal disease and impact vulnerable populations in countries regardless of levels of development . We examined the seasonal and climatic influences of acute diarrhoeal disease reports in Singapore a city state located in Southeast Asia . We used a time series analysis adjusting for time varying potential confounders in a negative binomial regression model and fitting fractional polynomials to investigate the relationship between climatic factors and reported diarrhoeal disease . We included 1 798 198 reports of diarrhoeal disease from 2005 to 2018 . We observed annual trimodal peaks in the number of reports . Every 10 increase in relative humidity in the present week was positively associated with an increase in reports one week later 1.030 95 CI 1.0041.057 and negatively associated with a decrease in reports six weeks later . We observed effect modification of relative humidity on the risk of diarrhoeal disease in the first calendar quarter . There was weak evidence of a delayed effect of ambient air temperature on reports of diarrhoeal disease one week later . No threshold effects of climatic factors were observed . Each week of school holidays was associated with a 14.4 reduction in diarrhoeal disease reports . Public holidays were associated with a reduction in reports in the same week and an increase a week later . Diarrhoeal disease is highly seasonal and is associated with climate variability . Food safety and primary healthcare resource mitigation could be timed in anticipation of seasonal and climate driven increases in disease reports .

@highlight Relative humidity was positively associated with the risk of diarrhoea.
@highlight Seasonality was a major determinant of diarrhoea.
@highlight Public and school holidays were associated with diarrhoea reports.
@highlight Annual trimodal illness peaks suggest the importance of timing mitigation measures.
@highlight Mitigation measures must include food safety and primary healthcare resource plans.
