 Prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals may impair genital development and alter reproductive tract anatomy . Anogenital distance is a useful biomarker of exposure to chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors . We evaluated associations between prenatal and perinatal exposure to several persistent organic pollutants and AGD in 4 year old children . Data were drawn from the INMA Asturias cohort . Pediatricians measured the anofourchetal distance in female children and anoscrotal distance in male children . The anogenital index was defined as the AGD divided by the child s weight at age of examination . We measured the levels of two hexachlorocyclohexane isomers hexachlorobenzene dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites six polychlorinated biphenyl congeners and six polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners in maternal serum at 12 gestational weeks and in cord blood serum . Anthropometric and parental sociodemographic variables were collected via face to face interviews . Linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between exposure to POPs and AGI adjusted for confounders and stratified by sex . In male children we found inverse associations between AGI and maternal concentrations of PCB 138 0.074 0.008 second tertile PCB 153 PCB 180 0.065 95 CI 0.096 0.035 second tertile 0.042 95 CI 0.073 0.011 third tertile PBDE 209 cord serum concentrations of PCB 153 and PCB 180 . In female children AGI was positively associated with maternal serum concentrations of PCB 101 and higher cord serum levels of 4 4 DDT and 4 4 DDE . Our findings provide evidence of associations between specific POPs and AGI in boys and girls aged 4 years and suggest that pre perinatal exposure to POPs has a feminizing effect in males and a masculinizing effect in females .

@highlight Pre perinatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls was associated with a smaller AGI in male children at 4 years old.
@highlight Perinatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was associated with a larger AGI in female children at 4 years old.
@highlight Pre perinatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants may impair genital development and alter the anatomy of the reproductive tract.
