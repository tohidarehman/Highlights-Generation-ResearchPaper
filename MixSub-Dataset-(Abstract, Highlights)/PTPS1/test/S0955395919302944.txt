 Online crowdsourcing methods have proved useful for studies of diverse designs in the behavioral and addiction sciences . The remote and online setting of crowdsourcing research may provide easier access to unique participant populations and improved comfort for these participants in sharing sensitive health or behavioral information . To date few studies have evaluated the use of qualitative research methods on crowdsourcing platforms and even fewer have evaluated the quality of data gathered . The purpose of the present analysis was to document the feasibility and validity of using crowdsourcing techniques for collecting qualitative data among people who use drugs . Participants Qualitative data recruitment was feasible as evidenced by the rapid sampling of a relatively large number of participants from diverse geographic regions . Computerized text analysis indicated high ratings of authenticity for the provided narratives . These authenticity percentiles were higher than the average of general normative writing samples as well as than those collected in experimental settings . These findings support the feasibility and quality of qualitative data collected in online settings broadly and crowdsourced settings specifically . Future work among people who use drugs may leverage crowdsourcing methods and the access to hard to sample populations to complement existing studies in the human laboratory and clinic as well as those using other digital technology methods .

@highlight We evaluate the use of crowdsourcing for collecting qualitative data.
@highlight We collected non medical opioid to heroin fentanyl use transition narratives.
@highlight Recruitment was feasible with sampling from diverse geographic locations.
@highlight High ratings of authenticity were observed for the provided narratives.
