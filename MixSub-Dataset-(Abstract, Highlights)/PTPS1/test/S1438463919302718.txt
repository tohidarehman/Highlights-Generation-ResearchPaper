 The aim of this study was to determine the association between levels of residential surrounding greenness preschool children s park use sedentary behaviour and mental and general health . This cross sectional study included 1489 4 6 year old children residents of Kaunas city Lithuania . Responses to the questionnaires completed by parents were used to ascertain children s general and mental health . We estimated exposure to greenness by the normalised difference vegetation index and time spent in a park . We used multivariate logistic regression models to explore the independent associations between health outcomes and surrounding greenness and time spent in the nearest city park controlling for potential confounders . Of all the studied children 14 had poor perceived general health and 44.7 spent 5 or more hours per week in city parks . A significant increase in sedentary behaviour was observed in children with poor health . Every additional hour of time spent in parks was associated with decreased sedentary behaviour and a lower risk of poor health meanwhile lower residential greenness was associated with poorer mental and general health . Compared with NDVI 100m median and park use exceeding 5h per week lower greenness exposure and shorter park usage were associated with the risk of poor health and the general risk of mental difficulties in 46 year old children . Lower residential greenness levels and less time spent in a park were associated with poorer general and mental health among 4 6 year old children . Physical activity in green spaces is recommended as a measure to prevent poor general and mental health among children .
