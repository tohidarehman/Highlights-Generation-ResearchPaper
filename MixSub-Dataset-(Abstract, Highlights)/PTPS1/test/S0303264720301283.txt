 Here I use the rationale assuming that if of a certain trait that exerts its function in some aspect of the genetic code or more generally in protein synthesis it is possible to identify the evolutionary stage of its origin then it would imply that this evolutionary moment would be characterized by a high translational noise because this trait would originate for the first time during that evolutionary stage . That is to say if this trait had a non marginal role in the realization of the genetic code or in protein synthesis then the origin of this trait would imply that more generally it was the genetic code itself that was still originating . But if the genetic code were still originating at that precise evolutionary stage then this would imply that there was a high translational noise which in turn would imply that it was in the presence of a protocell i.e . a progenote that was by definition characterized by high translational noise . I apply this rationale to the mechanism of modification of the base 34 of the anticodon of an isoleucine tRNA that leads to the reading of AUA and AUG codons in archaea bacteria and eukaryotes . The phylogenetic distribution of this mechanism in these phyletic lineages indicates that this mechanism originated only after the evolutionary stage of the last universal common ancestor namely during the formation of cellular domains i.e . at the stage of ancestors of these main phyletic lineages . Furthermore given that this mechanism of modification of the base 34 of the anticodon of the isoleucine tRNA would result to emerge at a stage of the origin of the genetic code despite in its terminal phases then all this would imply that the ancestors of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes were progenotes . If so all the more so the LUCA would also be a progenote since it preceded these ancestors temporally . A consequence of all this reasoning might be that since these three ancestors were of the progenotes that were different from each other if at least one of them had evolved into at least two real and different cells basically different from each other then the number of cellular domains would not be three but it would be greater than three .
