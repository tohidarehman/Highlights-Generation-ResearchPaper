 To determine the prevalence patterns of use and consequences of inhaling alcohol vapour or mist . Cross sectional survey recruiting an international non probability sample of people who use alcohol and other drugs as part of the annual Global Drug Survey . Online questionnaire translated into 19 languages . 110 557 people took part in GDS2020 and 88 124 completed a question about inhaling alcohol in the last 12 months . The focus of this study is GDS2020 respondents who reported inhaling alcohol mist vapour from a balloon in the last 12 months . Last 12 month use of alcohol vapour onset duration intensity of effects value for money compared with alcohol and incidence of falls injuries . A total of 803 people reported the use of alcohol vapour in the last 12 months with 51 of the sample coming from 3 countries Australia Denmark and England . Two thirds were male and they were more likely to be under 25 . 45.7 reported that they were a bit very drunk before they inhaled alcohol . 51.3 reported that the effects lasted for less than 5mins . Both the intensity of effect and perceived value for money showed a normal distribution on a 10 point scale . 12.7 of respondents reported falling injuring themselves . Inhaling alcohol vapour appears to be more common amongst younger higher risk drinkers . The rapid onset of action and inability to titrate consumption to effect is a risk for acute injury . We consider that alcohol is harmful enough through oral consumption without adding to the risk of injury by offering such a potentially risky additional administration method .

@highlight Alcohol is usually taken orally but a recent trend to inhale its vapours or mists has emerged and little is known about this experience and its effects.
@highlight In a global study respondents from Australia denmark and england had tried this practice 45.7 were already drunk when they did so and 12.7 of whom had fallen or injured themselves afterwards.
@highlight Inhaling alcohol vapours or mists may contribute to excessive intoxication and harm. Further research is needed to understand more about the associated risks and harms in order to inform public health policy and licensing decisions.
