 As one of the deadliest diseases cancer frequently resists existing therapeutics because they do not target all cells within a progressing tumor for example both tumor stem and proliferating cells . This frequently results in enrichment of invasive and metastatic drug resistant tumor cells subpopulations cancer recurrence and eventually patient mortality . Thus there is an urgent need to identify specific markers by which the targeted imaging and or therapeutic guided missile like agents can specifically detect and or eradicate all cancer cells within a heterogeneous tumor while leaving the normal cells intact . As a member of heat shock protein 70 superfamily glucose regulated protein 78 has been documented as a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum which mainly responds to ER stresses in normal cells . There is over expression of GRP78 on the surface of cancer cells and angiogenic endothelial cells which makes it a promising target for different types of peptides and antibodies that can be employed for targeted cancer therapy or imaging . In this review we discuss the biological processes functional importance and translocation mechanisms of cell surface GRP78 in tumor cells . As a cancer biomarker we also review the potential applications of csGRP78 targeted therapy and imaging and finally we suggest a brief roadmap ahead of csGRP78 targeting for targeted theranostic implications .

@highlight csGRP78 is expressed principally by cancer cells and angiogenic endothelial cells.
@highlight csGRP78 is a promising cancer biomarker and target for imaging and therapy.
@highlight csGRP78 targeting moieties can be integrated into nanoparticles.
@highlight Anti csGRP78 antibodies targeting different epitopes differ in therapeutic impact.
@highlight New generation csGRP78 targeting agents should encourage clinical testing.
