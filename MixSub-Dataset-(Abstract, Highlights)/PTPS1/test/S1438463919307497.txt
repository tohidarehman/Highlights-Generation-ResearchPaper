 As part of an investigation of the total indoor exposure of residents in PCB contaminated apartments in a building estate in Denmark 73 homes were visited . Samples of air vacuum cleaner dust and surface wipes were taken and analysed for 15 PCB congeners . The 53 apartments located in high rise buildings with indoor PCB containing sealants showed significant elevated total concentrations of PCB in air dust and surface wipes compared to 20 reference homes . The average concentration in exposed homes was 2330ng PCB

@highlight Air dust and surface wipe samples were taken in 73 homes and analysed for PCB.
@highlight Highly elevated levels were observed in homes having indoor sealants with PCB.
@highlight Limited diurnal variations in PCB air concentrations were observed.
@highlight Dust and surface wipes have the potential as screening tools for PCB in air.
