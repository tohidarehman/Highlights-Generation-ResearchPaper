 The use of intraperitoneal administration of nanoparticles has been reported to facilitate higher concentrations of nanoparticles in metastatic peritoneal tumors . While this strategy is appealing for limiting systemic exposure of nanocarrier delivered toxic cargoes and increasing nanoparticle concentrations in avascular peritoneal tumors little is known about the mechanism of nanoparticle accumulation on tumor tissues and currently no nanoparticle based product has been approved for intraperitoneal delivery . Here we investigated the nanoparticle specific characteristics that led to increased peritoneal tumor accumulation using MCM 41 type mesoporous silica nanoparticles as our model system . We also investigated the components of the peritoneal tumor stroma that facilitated nanoparticle tumor interaction . The tumor extracellular matrix is the main factor driving these interactions specifically the interaction of nanoparticles with collagen . Upon disruption of the collagen matrix nanoparticle accumulation was reduced by 50 . It is also notable that the incorporation of targeting ligands did not increase overall tumor accumulation
