 Enteropathogen contamination of water resources is a global concern . Several sources and routes of pathogen contamination of water resources have been identified including agriculture . Land spreading or disposal of manure livestock wastes is a notable source of public health relevant microorganisms into water . Microorganisms can be transported from manure amended soils into water from where they can reach animals and humans and may cause infection . This review explores the public health relevance of manure borne pathogens highlighting some of the diseases that manure associated pathogens cause . It also examines the dynamics of overland transport of pathogens into surface waters and percolation through soils into groundwater . Factors that influence the survival and transport of pathogens into respective water resources are discussed . The actual number of pathogens shed pathogen release rate requisite flow conditions precipitation characteristics and pathogen inactivation potential are some general factors examined in this review . Pathogen adaptation and survival in the soil environment is extensively discussed because soils significantly influence pathogen transfer into water . In addition to soil characteristics environmental variables such as moisture temperature and pH as well as soil biology are relevant aspects considered herein . Manure and farm management practices such as manure source and type storage and treatment also influence the occurrence survival and transport potential of pathogens . Optimized and recommended manure treatment techniques like composting which has been demonstrated to satisfactorily inactivate enteric pathogens in manure are discussed . The need for proper composting by observing recommended manuring stipulations is emphasized and finally practical strategies to protect water resources from pathogenic contamination are elucidated .

@highlight Livestock waste is a reservoir for public health relevant pathogens.
@highlight Improper management of manure may constitute a major public health hazard.
@highlight Fecal contamination of water continues to be a major cause of transmission of many clinically relevant pathogens to humans.
@highlight Depending on survival and transport conditions manure associated pathogens could be disseminated into the water.
@highlight To minimize environmental impacts proper manure management is necessary.
