 The application of Water Safety Plans in China varies throughout the country . Although pilot WSP projects in China were initiated shortly after WSP was introduced by the World Health Organization in 2004 they have yet to be used for water supply facilities at a large scale . To better understand the evolution of WSP application in China a systematic review was conducted to identify all published WSP related studies in China . Eighteen studies which included 311 water systems were included in the final analysis . Risk matrix water supply risk factors and other data were extracted and analyzed . Text mining methods were also used to better understand risks that can be addressed by WSPs . This study revealed a number of noteworthy differences between and among urban and rural water systems in China . The primary risks associated with most urban water supply systems tended to be related to mechanical failure s in the water treatment process . Rural water supply systems appear to suffer from similar problems but insufficient overall management capacity was more prevalent in rural systems . Overall the evidence suggests that to date the use of WSPs in China has been primarily limited to pilot studies and full implementation of WSPs in China appears to still be in the early stages . The paper closes with a summary of the key obstacles identified as well as a discussion of policies and technical options which could increase the use of WSPs in both urban and rural China . Among other recommendations the data indicate that there is strong need for the development and implementation of a simplified WSP approach designed specifically for small rural systems in China .

@highlight A summary of the implementation of WSPs in China from 2004 to 2018.
@highlight Evidence indicates huge differences between rural and urban water system risk management.
@highlight Full adoption of WSPs in China appears to still be at an early stage.
@highlight There is still a need for capacity building if WSP implementation is to scaleup China.
