 People who inject drugs have high rates of hepatitis C and yet many remain undiagnosed and untreated . HCV treatment guidelines and elimination strategies recommend task shifting to expand where and by whom HCV testing and care is delivered . A randomized controlled trial design was used to evaluate if point of care HCV antibody testing by peer outreach workers outside of health and social service spaces would improve engagement in HCV care . People with a lifetime history of injection drug use without prior knowledge of HCV antibody status were randomized to receive HCV outreach plus either POC or referral to community based HCV program for testing as usual . The study was co designed by people with lived experience of HCV . 920 people were approached to participate over 14 weeks . After refusals withdrawals and removal of duplicates there were 380 study participants . Outreach took place primarily in public spaces such as parks coffee shops and apartment lobbies . Participants reported very high rates of poverty housing instability and recent injection drug use . Despite being at high risk for HCV 61 had no history or knowledge of past HCV testing Peer outreach workers were able to efficiently reach a marginalized group of individuals who had a high HCV antibody prevalence and low rates of prior HCV testing . This improved participants knowledge of their HCV antibody status but that knowledge in itself did not lead to any change in participant s subsequent engagement in HCV care . Future work is required to evaluate strategies such as incentives or peer navigators to improve linkage to HCV care after diagnosis .

@highlight Task shifting point of care HCV antibody testing to peer workers is feasible.
@highlight Outreach workers efficiently reached at risk and highly marginalized individuals.
@highlight HCV antibody status alone appears insufficient to drive engagement in HCV care.
