 Alcohol labels are one strategy for raising consumer awareness about the negative consequences of alcohol but evidence to inform labels is limited . This quasi experimental study sought to test the real world impact of strengthening health messages on alcohol container labels on consumer attention message processing and self reported drinking . Alcohol labels with a cancer warning national drinking guidelines and standard drink information were implemented in the intervention site and usual labelling practices continued in the comparison site . Changes in key indicators of label effectiveness were assessed among a cohort of adult drinkers in both the intervention and comparison sites using three waves of surveys conducted before and at two time points after the alcohol label intervention . Generalized Estimating Equations with difference in difference terms were used to examine the impact of the label intervention on changes in outcomes . Strengthening health messages on alcohol container labels significantly increased consumer attention to 17.2 95 CI 8.2 36.2 and processing of labels and consumer reports of drinking less due to the labels . Strengthening health messages on alcohol containers can achieve their goal of attracting attention deepening engagement and enhancing motivation to reduce alcohol use . Strengthening alcohol labelling policies should be a priority for alcohol control globally .

@highlight Enhanced alcohol labels can improve label salience and processing among drinkers.
@highlight Drinkers exposed to labels were more likely to report drinking less due to labels.
@highlight Strengthening alcohol labels should be a priority for alcohol control.
@highlight More research is needed to confirm optimal label design and label effectiveness.
