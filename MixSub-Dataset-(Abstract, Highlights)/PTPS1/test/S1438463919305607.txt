 Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls in buildings constructed with PCB containing materials can lead to increased body burden of PCB for building users . Exposure to PCB from building related sources was assessed by measuring PCB in serum and hand wipes in two groups of tenants living in the same building estate in apartments constructed with and without PCB . The median serum levels of the sum of 19 PCB congeners was 777ng g lw for the exposed group and 282ng g lw for the reference group . The congener pattern in serum of the exposed was shifted towards lower chlorinated congeners and was dominated by tri and tetrachlorinated congeners . The largest difference in serum levels between the groups was observed for PCB 28 with median levels of the exposed being 70 times higher than in the reference group . For very persistent lower chlorinated congeners like PCB 28 66 and 74 an increase with residence times was observed as a result of accumulation over time . Less persistent congeners such as PCB 44 and 70 were also elevated in the exposed group but independent of residence time . The less persistent congeners can therefore be used as markers of recent exposure to original PCB sources . The hand wipes also showed a large exposure contrast e.g . PCB 28 being more than 60 times higher in the exposed group compared to the reference group and no overlap between the groups . All measured di to pentaPCB congeners were significantly higher in hand wipes from the exposed group compared with the reference group . Thus hand wipes seem to be a good non invasive screening tool for ongoing indoor exposure to PCB . Furthermore the measured level of PCB on hand wipes was significantly correlated to PCB in blood for almost all congeners . In conclusion PCB exposure in contaminated buildings can contribute significantly to the exposure and total body burden of PCB and the lower chlorinated congeners can make up the majority of the total PCB body burden .

@highlight Indoor exposure can be the main contributor to the total body burden of PCB.
@highlight Indoor exposure to PCB is reflected in serum samples after a few years of exposure.
@highlight PCB 44 and 70 in serum can be used as markers of recent exposure to original sources.
@highlight Hand wipes can be used for screening of recent PCB exposure indoors.
@highlight For PCB 28 an increasing serum levels was observed with increasing residence time.
