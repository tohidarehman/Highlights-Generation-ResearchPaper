 Despite a 15 year long effort to define the safety of fish intake during pregnancy there remains still uncertainty on this important public health issue . The evaluation of the toxic effects of contaminants particularly mercury in fish eating populations is complicated by the fact that sea food is also rich in beneficial nutrients such as selenium . There is toxicological plausibility of an antagonistic effects between Se and Hg and some theoretical support for the inclusion of the SeHg interaction to better assess the risk linked with fish intake . To assess the effects of exposure to low level Hg through fish consumption on the developing brain and the interaction between Hg and Se we conducted an analysis at age 40 months in Italian children enrolled in a prospective mother child cohort comparing additive and multiplicative models .
