 Drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye is challenging due to several anatomical and physiological barriers . Thus there is a need for prolonged action and targeted drug delivery to treat retinal diseases . Intravitreal injections avoid anterior eye barriers but the vitreoretinal interface and inner limiting membrane may prevent access of drug delivery systems to the retina . Existing data on retinal permeation of intravitreal nanoparticles are sparse and probably misleading due to the inter species differences of retinal structures in rodents and humans . To bridge this gap retinal permeation of light activated liposomes was studied in an ex vivo bovine explant system that simulates the structure of vitreoretinal interface and intact ILM . Our findings indicate that the particle size plays a significant role in determining the retinal penetration as the liposomes of 100nm sized failed to overcome the ILM and could not permeate into the retina . In addition our results demonstrate the impact of surface charge and PEG coating on retinal penetration . Small anionic liposomes with PEG coating showed the most extensive distribution and cellular localization in the retina . In summary this study extends understanding of ocular barriers and provides valuable information to augment design of retinal drug delivery systems .
