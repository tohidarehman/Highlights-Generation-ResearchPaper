 This follow up study of 82 children investigated the potential impact of early and recent exposure to mercury and lead on their neurodevelopmental performance at 58 years of age . Early exposure of these children to mercury methylmercury and lead was assessed during lactation at 312 months old as well as their mother s exposure using measurements from a cross sectional study . Only infants who failed to pass the neurodevelopment screening tools and or had elevated mercury were included in this study . Urine and hair were sampled during the follow up study to assess the children s recent exposure to mercury methylmercury and lead . Their cognitive performance and visual motor integration were also measured using the Test of Non Verbal Intelligence and the Beery Visual Motor Integration respectively . The association between alterations in urinary porphyrins excretion and exposure to metals was analyzed and their influence on the children s neurodevelopment was explored . Linear regression models revealed a significant negative association between the infants mercury exposure during lactation and the TONI Quotient and Beery VMI Age Equivalent scores at age 58 . The mothers blood methylmercury was inversely and significantly associated with their children s TONI Quotient . In contrast the children s Beery VMI Age Equivalent scores were positively and significantly associated with the hair methylmercury of the mothers and their infants . These relationships suggest the presence of negative confounding that we did not take into account . Unlike mercury there was some evidence that lead in breast milk had an inverse relationship with the children s visual motor coordination skills . Our study did not show a clear association between children s recent exposure to metals and neurodevelopment . However a significant inverse association was observed between the TONI Quotient and the interaction of hair methylmercuryporphyrins implying that porphyrins are a sensitive measure of low body mercury burden . Although lead induced higher porphyrins excretion in urine their interaction did not influence children s neurodevelopmental scores . The interactions between metals and porphyrins might provide insights into their potential contributory role in the pathogenesis associated with neurological disorders or other diseases . Despite the small sample size of the present study its findings about the association between toxic metal exposure and the high risk of poor neurodevelopmental performance are worrying particularly at an early age and additional research is needed using larger sample sizes .

@highlight Exposure of children to mercury during lactation was associated with poor cognitive performance and visual motor integration.
@highlight The mothers blood methylmercury was inversely associated with childrens TONI Quotient.
@highlight Mothers and infants hair methylmercury were positively associated with Beery VMI scores.
@highlight Only the interaction between childrens hair methylmercury and porphyrins was inversely associated with TONI Quotient.
@highlight Urinary lead in children induced higher porphyrins excretion in urine but it did not influence their neurodevelopment.
