 We see the contours of a cigarette free adolescent cohort in Norway . Simultaneously increasing use of vaping devices among adolescents internationally and in the US in particular has evoked fear of a new nicotine addicted generation . This longitudinal study explores the vaping phenomenon in a context where nicotine e liquid is still prohibited . Data are from longitudinal qualitative interviews with a sizable sample of 12 17 year olds 118 8 Gradual and collective shifts in vaping practices and in the symbolic meaning of vaping were observed in three phases . First in 8 E cigarettes were devalued from novelty and transgression to childish and uninteresting within the same sample over a four year period . In conclusion e cigarettes in the sample represented fashionable experimentation rather than steady user patterns .

@highlight Vaping in the study represented a time limited trend rather than a steady user pattern.
@highlight Drivers into experimentation with vaping were peer perceptions of novelty status emphasised harmlessness performance exposure and accessibility online.
@highlight Drivers out of vaping were changes in peer group perceptions diminished novelty and lack of addiction as the youth vaped non nicotine containing e liquids.
