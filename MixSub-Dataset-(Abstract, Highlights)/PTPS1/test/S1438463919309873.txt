 Identifying the origin of fecal contamination can support more effective interventions to interrupt enteric pathogen transmission . Microbial source tracking assays may help to identify environmental routes of pathogen transmission although these assays have performed poorly in highly contaminated domestic settings highlighting the importance of both diagnostic validation and understanding the context specific ecological physical and sociodemographic factors driving the spread of fecal contamination . We assessed fecal contamination of compounds in low income neighborhoods of urban Maputo Mozambique using a set of MST assays that were validated with animal stool and latrine sludge from study compounds . We sampled five environmental compartments involved in fecal microbe transmission and exposure compound water source household stored water and food preparation surfaces and soil from the entrance to the compound latrine and the entrances to each household . Each sample was analyzed by culture for the general fecal indicator

@highlight Sanitation is a pervasive and understudied challenge in crowded urban settlements.
@highlight We applied microbial source tracking to understand routes of pathogen transmission.
@highlight Human fecal microbes were common in soil and stored water but not source water.
@highlight Fecal contamination was observed regardless of modifying conditions in households.
@highlight Transformational changes are likely needed to prevent enteric disease transmission.
