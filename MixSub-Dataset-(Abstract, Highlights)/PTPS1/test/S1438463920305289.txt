 The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment in different countries around the world . Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification are urgently needed . Given the situation the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that in settings where facemasks are not available healthcare personnel might use homemade masks for the care of patients with COVID 19 as a last resort . Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail . Moreover there are a series of non medical materials available on the market such as household air filters coffee filters and different types of fabrics which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available . In this study we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size dependent filtration performances of non medical materials . The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size dependent filtration performances . The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials . The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance . Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators .

@highlight Agencies suggest the manufacturing of homemade face masks during COVID 19.
@highlight This work examined a wide range of non medical materials for their filtration performance.
@highlight We studied the influences of face velocity number of filter material layers and the size dependent filtration efficiency.
@highlight Several layers of household air filters can achieve similar filtration performance compared to N95 materials.
@highlight The information will be crucial for healthcare personnel and the general public in manufacturing homemade face masks.
