 With increased use of electronic nicotine delivery devices and non cigarettes tobacco products among adolescents the percentage of Italian students who use nicotine products is at its highest level of the past ten years even though prevention and anti smoking policies have produced tangible results in decreasing tobacco smoking prevalence . This cross sectional study examined trends in exclusive and dual smoking identified new poly consumption patterns and profiled old and new nicotine users . We used the annual cross sectional ESPAD Italia survey which sampled students currently used for surveillance and monitoring of at risk population between 2012 and 2018 The lifetime prevalence of cigarette smokers slightly decreased from 60.9 in 2012 to 56.9 in 2018 whereas the proportion of vaping users substantially increased from 32.9 in 2013 to 52.0 in 2018 . Combining cigarette and vaping use these trends result in an increase in the lifetime prevalence of any use from 60.8 in 2013 to 66.2 in 2018 . Three out of every 10 minors have experienced smoking and or vaping and younger students were more prone to be dual users . Overall current vapers were generally less prone to risky behaviours . In contrast to a slight decrease in cigarette smoking the prevalence of Italian students approaching old and or new smoking habits in their lifetime is substantially increasing . The popularity of alternative nicotine based products particularly e cigarettes has increased among teenagers resulting in a summation of usage patterns rather than a compensation and attracting a novel slice of young users . The lack of regulation within current drug policy to limit the access to such licit psychoactive substance use is urgently needed to avoid a future nicotine addicted population .
