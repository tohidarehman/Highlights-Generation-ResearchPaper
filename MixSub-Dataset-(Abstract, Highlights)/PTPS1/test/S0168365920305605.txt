 Utilization of unique acidic environment in various disease sites has been quite advantageous in targeted drug delivery . Among the widely explored pH sensitive moieties such as hydrazone orthoester imine vinylether

@highlight Acetals hydrolyse at acidic pH following a first order kinetics.
@highlight Benzylidene acetal containing amphiphilic polymers self assemble into nano systems.
@highlight Acetal based nano systems facilitate targeted drug delivery in response to low pH.
@highlight The approach shows promising applications to treat cancer and bacterial infections.
