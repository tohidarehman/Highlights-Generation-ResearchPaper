 Georgia launched national HCV elimination program in 2015 . PWID may experience barriers to accessing HCV care . To improve linkage to care among PWID pilot program to integrate HCV treatment with HR services at opiate substitution therapy centers and needle syringe program sites was initiated . Our study aimed to assess satisfaction of patients with integrated HCV treatment services at HR centers . Survey was conducted among convenience sample of patients receiving HCV treatment at 5 integrated care sites and 4 specialized clinics not providing HR services . Simplified pre treatment diagnostic algorithm and treatment monitoring procedure was introduced for HCV treatment programs at OST NSP centers which includes fewer pre treatment and monitoring tests compared to standard algorithm . In total 358 patients participated in the survey 48.6 receiving HCV treatment at the specialized clinics while 51.4 at HR site with integrated treatment . Similar proportions of surveyed patients at HR sites and clinics stated that they did not face any barriers to enrollment in the elimination program . Most patients from HR pilot sites and specialized clinics stated that they received comprehensive information about the treatment 98.4 vs 94.3 Quality of services and perceived satisfaction of patients receiving treatment suggests that integration of HCV treatment with HR services is feasible .

@highlight Integrating the provision of hepatitis C treatment with HR services can improve access to services for PWID.
@highlight Care integration in HR decreased the time from diagnosis to receipt of the first dose of medication which can reduce dropout and improve initiation of treatment.
@highlight Satisfaction with treatment services was at least as good in the HR sites as in the specialized clinics.
