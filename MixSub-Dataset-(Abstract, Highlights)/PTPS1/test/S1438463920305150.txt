 Pyrethroid pesticide use is increasing worldwide although the full extent of associated health effects is unknown . An epigenome wide association study with exploratory pathway analysis may help identify potential pyrethroid related health effects . We performed an exploratory EWAS of chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure using control participants blood in the Parkinson s Environment and Genes Study in the Central Valley of California . We estimated associations of living and working near agricultural pyrethroid pesticide applications in the past 5 years with site specific differential methylation and used a false discovery rate cut off of 0.05 for significance . We controlled for age sex education cell count and an ancestral marker for Hispanic ethnicity . We normalized methylation values for Type I II probe bias using Beta Mixture Quantile normalization filtered out cross reactive probes and evaluated for remaining bias with Surrogate Variable Analysis . We also evaluated the effects of controlling for cell count and normalizing for Type I II probe bias by comparing changes in effect estimates and p values for the top hits across BMIQ and GenomeStudio normalization methods and controlling for cell count . To facilitate broader interpretation we annotated genes to the CpG sites and performed gene set overrepresentation analysis using genes annotated to CpG sites that were associated with pyrethroids at a raw p 0.05 and controlling for background representation of CpG sites on the chip . We did this for both a biological process context using missMethyl and a disease set context using WebGestalt . For these gene set overrepresentation analyses we also used an FDR cut off of 0.05 for significance of gene sets . After controlling for cell count and applying BMIQ normalization 4 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to pyrethroid exposures . When using GenomeStudio s Illumina normalization 415 CpG sites were differentially methylated including all four identified with the BMIQ method . In the gene set overrepresentation analyses we identified 6 GO terms using BMIQ normalization and 76 using Illumina normalization including the 6 identified by BMIQ . For disease sets we identified signals for Alzheimer s disease leukemia and several other cancers diabetes birth defects and other diseases for both normalization methods . We identified minimal changes in effect estimates after controlling for cell count and controlling for cell count generally weakened p values . BMIQ normalization however resulted in different beta coefficients and weakened p values . Chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure is associated with differential methylation at CpG sites that annotate to a wide variety of disease states and biological mechanisms that align with prior research . However this EWAS also implicates several novel diseases for future investigation and highlights the relative importance of different background normalization methods in identifying associations .
