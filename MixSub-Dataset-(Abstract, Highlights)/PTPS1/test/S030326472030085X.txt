 Paces of change are faster in cultural evolution than in biological evolution due to different levels of stability in information storage . This study develops mathematical models to investigate the consequences of differential mutation rates on the ability of groups of information units to survive over many generations . We examined the ability of groups composed of connected units to live on despite the occurrence of deleterious mutations that occur at probabilities ranging from 10

@highlight Groups should avoid a critical size threshold where chances of survival are minimal.
@highlight Frequent cultural changes do not prevent large groups from surviving over time.
@highlight Growth favors the survival of groups undergoing rates of cultural change.
