 Evidence of negative health effects of solid waste management is uncertain . Available reviews suggests the use of biomarkers in human biomonitoring to detect low exposure levels . In September 2013 a waste to energy plant located in the Turin went into operation . The SPoTT monitoring program was set up to assess the potential health impact caused by the plant . The paper illustrates the results of HBM of metals in the workers before the plant went into operation and then at 1 year and 3 years . This study is one of the few focusing on workers with a longitudinal design .

@highlight This is one of the few longitudinal study focusing on incinerator workers.
@highlight The concentration of most of the metals decreased over time.
@highlight The downward trend remained also after taking confounding factors into account.
@highlight An increase was noted for Pt Mn and Sb but not attributable to the plant activity.
@highlight Results are in line with those of the residents and with the ambient air measurements.
