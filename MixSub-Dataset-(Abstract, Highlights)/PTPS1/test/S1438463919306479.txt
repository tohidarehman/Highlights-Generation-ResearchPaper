 Recently in South Africa wastewater treatment plants have come under scrutiny because of increased reports of their ineffectiveness to treat wastewater adequately . This study focused on assessing potential health risks for humans exposed to concentrations of heavy metals in river systems that receive effluents from wastewater treatment plants in the Maluti a Phofung municipality . Untreated influents and treated effluents from two plants one in the town of Phuthaditjhaba the other in the town of Harrismith were analysed for heavy metals . Water samples were also collected from the Elands and the Wilge Rivers which receive effluents from the treatment plants in Phuthaditjhaba and Harrismith respectively . All samples were analysed for heavy metals Iron Magnesium Manganese Zinc Copper Chromium Nickel Lead Cobalt Arsenic Cadmium using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry . The probabilistic human health risk was estimated using the Total Hazard quotient and Monte Carlo techniques . The results showed that there was no significant difference between treated and untreated wastewater in the concentration of heavy metals for both wastewater treatment plants using the student T test . This indicated the inability of both treatment plants to remove metal contaminants adequately . Projections of non cancer risk for metals in river water samples indicated a high potential for non cancer risk for humans upon exposure via ingestion with Arsenic being a significant contributor to overall risk . The results of this study underscore the need for improved wastewater treatment facilities in this region in order to ensure ecosystem integrity and public health safety .

@highlight Heavy metals removal by WWTPs was inadequate.
@highlight Heavy metals in Elands and Wilge Rivers are mainly from WWTPs.
@highlight Arsenic in river water compromises the health safety of surrounding communities.
@highlight Monitoring of heavy metals in streams that drain WWTPs is imperative.
@highlight This is the first report on probabilistic risk assessment in the Vaal River Basin.
