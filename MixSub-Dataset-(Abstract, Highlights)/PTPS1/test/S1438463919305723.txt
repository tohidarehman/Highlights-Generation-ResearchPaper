 Exposure to occupational noise might increase the risk of hypertension . However limited cohort studies have investigated the relationship between time varying exposure to occupational noise and the development of hypertension . We conducted a 17 year cohort study involving 2459 workers to assess the relationship between time varying exposure to occupational noise and incident hypertension in the aerospace industry . We performed an extended Cox proportional hazard model considering occupational noise exposure as time varying covariates . Furthermore we employed the distributed lag nonlinear models to examine the exposure response relationship . In the extended Cox proportional model as workers were exposed to noise over 80 dBA the hazard ratios of hypertension significantly increased with a noise increase of 5 dBA . In exposure response associations the HRs of hypertension steadily increased between noise levels of 82 and 106 dBA . After additionally adjusting for personal protection equipment the HRs decreased dramatically between 107 and 124 dBA . Our study refined the exposure assessment by integrating time varying exposures to occupational noise and taking work history into consideration . Our findings suggested that workers exposed to noise levels between 82 and 106 dBA for 317 years may increase the risk of hypertension with a non linear exposure response pattern . We further provided evidence that workers wearing PPE could effectively reduce noise exposure and avoid the development of hypertension .
