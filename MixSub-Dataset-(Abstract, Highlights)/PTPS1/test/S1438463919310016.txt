 The recycling of end of life vessels is a complex activity that generates an enormous amount of hazardous waste including asbestos containing materials . Efforts by the Government of India to comply with national and international regulations and improved standard operating procedures are expected to lower the exposure risk of the workforce to hazardous substances including asbestos . The current workers are likely to face lesser risks than did those exposed in the past . The present study assesses the health risks from past exposure of asbestos for those workers engaged in handling and removing ACM in ship recycling yards before environmentally sound recycling of obsolete ships was introduced in the early 2000s . Estimates were made of the number of workers exposed and the intensity of exposure and these data were used to estimate the likely number of mesothelioma deaths in the future . It was estimated that nearly 15 of the total workforce engaged in ship recycling will suffer from mesothelioma which translates to about 4 513 mesothelioma deaths among the total of 31 000 workers estimated to be ever employed in the yards from 1994 till 2002 . Recommendations are made for a practical approach to the safe handling of ACMs in Indian ship recycling yards .

@highlight No previous study on cancer risk estimates due to asbestos exposure in Indian ship recycling yards have been reported.
@highlight It is likely that airborne asbestos fibre concentrations in Indian ship recycling yards could have exceeded 100 fibres ml.
@highlight Nearly 4500 mesothelioma deaths are likely to occur by the year 2027 due to improper asbestos handing at the yards.
@highlight These deaths have mostly gone unrecorded.
@highlight More deaths are projected to occur amongst bystander workers than those directly exposed to asbestos containing materials.
@highlight Recommendations are made for the safe management of asbestos containing materials in Indian ship recycling yards.
