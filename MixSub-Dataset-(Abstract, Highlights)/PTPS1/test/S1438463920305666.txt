 Residential greenness exposure is associated with many health outcomes including obesity cardiovascular disease and mental disorders . However few studies have assessed the effects of greenness exposure on activities of daily living . This study evaluated the relationship between greenness and ADL among elderly residents with long term care insurance in Shanghai China . We conducted a cross sectional survey using stratified random sampling among elderly residents with LTCI in six districts of Shanghai in August 2018 . We quantitatively assessed residential greenness using satellite derived normalized difference vegetation index values with 250 500 and 1000 m buffers around each participant s residential address . We calculated the walk score to assess neighborhood walkability . Physical function was assessed using basic ADL and instrumental ADL . We performed binary logistic regression and restricted cubic splines with R software . The study participants were 1067 adults with a mean age of 82.40 years . The mean NDVI value was 0.311 . In the fully adjusted model being in the highest tertile NDVI Our results indicate the importance of residential greenness exposure to physical functionespecially for BADL disability . Well designed longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms .

@highlight Higher residential greenness exposure was associated with lower risk of BADL disability.
@highlight A non linear association was observed between NDVI values and BADL disability.
@highlight A stronger protective effect of NDVI for BADL disability was observed in men elderly.
@highlight A stronger protective effect of NDVI for BADL disability was observed among respondents living in somewhat walkable area.
