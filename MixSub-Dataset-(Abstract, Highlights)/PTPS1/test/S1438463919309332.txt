 In most cases urban Wastewater Treatment Plants only partially abate pollutants occurring in the influent . Treated effluents can thus contain a complex mixture of ecotoxic pollutants such as heavy metals detergents disinfectants plasticizers pharmaceuticals residues or pesticides . In this context Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment provide essential decision making tools to public authorities for establishing environmental policies and conducting territorial planning . The present work aims to develop a territorial scale ERA methodology using two complementary approaches based on a Risk Quotient calculation the first based on the risk linked to each individual pollutant the second considering all pollutants present and the cocktail effect . This research was performed at 33 urban WWTPs of in a highly urbanized part of France . Initial minimum median and maximum pollutant concentrations in treated effluents were obtained from a literature review of physico chemical analysis studies to reconstitute typical effluents . The classical approach identified the riskiest substances and showed the risks for each WWTP . The mixture ERA approach revealed new risks which were not highlighted in the classical ERA approach thus increasing the number of WWTPs identified as at risk . This study shows the importance of accounting for the cocktail effect which is not considered in current regulatory decisions . Finally this methodology allowed us to identify the riskiest situations that could worsen in the context of climate change .

@highlight Micropollutants are often not effectively removed and so released by the urban WWTPs.
@highlight A territorial approach is essential to evaluate the risks linked to WWTP effluents.
@highlight Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment ERA for the WWTPs of the Grand Lyon territory was carried out.
@highlight Two different ERA approaches were used for WWTP risk assessment.
@highlight Mixture ERA revealed hidden risks compared to the classic single substance approach.
