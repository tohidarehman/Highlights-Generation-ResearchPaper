 To investigate if ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease is associated with long term occupational exposure to ultrafine particles outdoors at an airport . This is a register based follow up study based on a cohort comprising an exposed group of 6515 men employed in unskilled work at Copenhagen Airport and a reference group of 61 617 men in unskilled work in other firms in greater Copenhagen during 19902012 . The exposure was assessed from information on proportion of time spent on the airport apron for each calendar year and the primary exposure measure was cumulated apron years . The cohort was merged to the National Patient Register that includes data on all contacts to public and private hospitals in Denmark and the Register of Causes of Death . Risk estimates were provided by Poisson regression and adjusted for age calendar year and educational level . We found no associations between cumulative apron years and IHD or cerebrovascular disease when adjusted for confounders . In this large cohort study we found no association between outdoor occupational exposure to UFP and IHD and cerebrovascular disease .

@highlight No association between occupational exposure to ultrafine particles and cardiovascular diseases at Copenhagen Airport.
@highlight We found no associations between cumulative apron years and ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease.
@highlight Research in this area is still limited and more research is needed.
