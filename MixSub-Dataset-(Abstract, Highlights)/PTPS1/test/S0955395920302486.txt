 Engaging the community in decisions making is recognised as important for improving public health and is recommended in global alcohol strategies and in national policies on controlling alcohol availability . Yet there is little understanding of We conducted case studies in three local government areas in England in 2018 purposively selected for examples of community engagement in decisions affecting the local alcohol environment . We conducted 20 semi structured interviews with residents workers local politicians and local government practitioners and analysed documents linked to engagement and alcohol decision making . Four rationales for engaging the community in decision making affecting the alcohol environment were identified i as part of statutory decision making processes ii to develop new policies iii as representation on committees and iv occurring through relationship building . Many of the examples related to alcohol licensing processes but also local economy and community safety decision making . The impact of community inputs on decisions was often not clear but there were a few instances of engagement influencing the process and outcome of decision making relating to the alcohol environment . While influencing statutory licensing decision making is challenging community experiences of alcohol related harms can be valuable evidence to support new licensing policies . Informal relationship building between communities and local government is also beneficial for sharing information about alcohol related harms and to facilitate future engagement . However care must be taken to balance the different interests among diverse community actors relating to the local alcohol environment and extra support is needed for those with least capacity to engage but who face more burden of alcohol related harms to avoid compounding existing inequalities .
