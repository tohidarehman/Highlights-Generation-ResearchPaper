 Owing to their tremendous potential the inference of nano scaled materials has revolutionized many fields including the medicine and health particularly for development of various types of targeted drug delivery devices for early prognosis and successful treatment of various diseases including the brain disorders . Owing to their unique characteristic features a variety of nanomaterials have shown tremendous success in achieving the prognostic and therapeutic goals for early prognosis and treatment of various brain maladies such as Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease brain lymphomas and other ailments . However serious attention is needful due to innumerable after effects of the nanomaterials . Despite their immense contribution in optimizing the prognostic and therapeutic modalities biological interaction of nanomaterials with various body tissues may produce severe nanotoxicity of different organs including the heart liver kidney lungs immune system gastro intestinal system skin as well as nervous system . However in this review we have primarily focused on nanomaterials induced neurotoxicity of the brain . Following their translocation into different regions of the brain nanomaterials may induce neurotoxicity through multiple mechanisms including the oxidative stress DNA damage lysosomal dysfunction inflammatory cascade apoptosis genotoxicity and ultimately necrosis of neuronal cells . Our findings indicated that rigorous toxicological evaluations must be carried out prior to clinical translation of nanomaterials based formulations to avoid serious neurotoxic complications which may further lead to develop various neuro degenerative disorders .

@highlight Owing to their salient features and dynamicity the implication of nano scaled materials has revolutionized many fields.
@highlight Prolonged deposition and interaction of nano scaled materials with the neuronal tissues may cause severe neurotoxicity.
@highlight Nanomaterials induced neurotoxicity is dependent on various predisposing factors including the particle size and dose.
@highlight Ultra fine nanomaterials 50 nm demonstrate more severe neurotoxicity compared to bigger size nanomaterials.
@highlight Oxidative stress is one of the principle mechanisms adopted nano scaled materials to induce neurotoxicity in brain tissues.
