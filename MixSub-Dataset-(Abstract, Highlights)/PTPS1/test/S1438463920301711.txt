 The phase out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers flame retardants has led to the rapid increase of alternatives such as phosphate flame retardants and plasticizers in many consumer products . Exposure to these additive chemicals is widespread and potentially harmful to humans and the environment . In the present study we assessed the exposure to PFRs through the analysis of metabolites in urine collected from 7 year old children from Hokkaido Japan between 2012 and 2017 . This allowed us to investigate temporal and seasonal trends for PFR metabolite concentrations and to study determinants of exposure . Thirteen metabolites of seven PFRs were measured in morning spot urine samples

@highlight Eight metabolites of frequently used PFRs were found in 50 of the samples.
@highlight Significant yearly increase in BDCIPP BCIPHIPP and EHPHP levels from 2012 to 2017.
@highlight Season is a strong predictor of BCIPHIPP BDCIPP BBOEHEP BBOEP and DPHP.
@highlight Frequent use of ventilation was consistently associated with higher PFR exposure.
