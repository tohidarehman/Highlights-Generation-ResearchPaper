 We review the challenges of next generation therapeutics for both systemic and localised delivery to brain tumours and discuss how recent engineering advances may be used to enhance brain penetration of systemic delivery therapies .

@highlight Nano scale therapeutic delivery systems emerging as potential future medicines for malignant gliomas.
@highlight Augmentation and or enhanced penetration of blood brain barrier a major challenge for systemic delivery.
@highlight Advances in localised drug delivery and stimuli responsive nanoparticles.
