 A metapopulation model is investigated to explore how the spatial heterogeneity affects predatorprey interactions . A RosenzweigMacArthur predatorprey model with dispersal of both the prey and predator is formulated . We propose such a system as a well mixed spatial model . Here partially mixed spatial models are defined in which the dispersal of only one of the communities is considered . In our study the spatial heterogeneity is induced by dissimilar dispersal rates between the patches . A large difference between the predator dispersal rates may stabilize the unstable positive equilibrium of the model . The existence of two ecological phenomena are found under independent harvesting strategy stability switching and hydra effect . When prey or predator is harvested in a heterogenious environment a positive stable steady state becomes unstable with increasing the harvesting effort and a further increase in the effort leads to a stable equilibrium . Thus a stability switching happens . Furthermore the predator biomass in both the patches increases when the patch with a higher predator density is harvested resulting a hydra effect . These two phenomena do not occur in the non spatial RM model . Hence spatial heterogeneity induces stability switching and hydra effect .

@highlight A RosenzweigMacArthur predatorprey metapopulation model with dispersal is built.
@highlight Unbalanced predator dispersal may cause stability at interior equilibrium when both the identical and isolated patches are unstable.
@highlight Harvesting of either prey or predator causes stability switching.
@highlight Hydra effect is detected at stable steady state in the spatial model when predator is harvested.
