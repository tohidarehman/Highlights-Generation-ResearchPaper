 Catalonia requires decentralized and simplified strategies for the diagnosis of viremic HCV infection among people who inject drugs . We aimed to perform a direct comparison of the diagnostic performance between two single step strategies for the screening and diagnosis of viremic HCV infection in PWID attending a drug consumption room in Barcelona i on site HCV RNA testing using the point of care test Xpert HCV VL Fingerstick and ii on site dried blood spots collection for HCV RNA testing at the laboratory . Additionally we aimed to assess participants preferences in receiving HCV RNA testing results and feasibility of same day delivery of PoCT results . The real world clinical performance of these two strategies was established in comparison with the reference method . HCV genotypes subtypes and HIV status were also determined by sequencing and serology respectively . A questionnaire including preferences regarding the delivery of test results was administered . The prevalence of HCV RNA was 63.0 . The RNA PoCT showed a sensitivity of 98.4 for detectable viral loads and of 100 for quantifiable viral loads . For the DBS based assay a sensitivity of 93.7 was obtained for detectable viral loads 96.7 for the quantifiable 10 IU mL threshold and 98.3 for both the quantifiable 1000 and 3000 IU mL thresholds . No significant differences were detected between the sensitivity values of these two strategies and the specificity was 100 in both cases . Half of the participants preferred to receive the HCV RNA result on the same day and 80 of participants received their RNA PoCT results on the same day . Both the HCV RNA PoCT and the DBS based assay are highly reliable tools for the simplified diagnosis of viremic HCV infection among current PWID . These strategies allow for on site sample collection and delivery of test results facilitating decentralized care in harm reduction services .

@highlight The Xpert FS PoCT and the DBS based HCV RNA assay are simple and reliable methods for HCV testing in PWID.
@highlight The sensitivity and specificity were not significantly different between assays in our real world setting.
@highlight 50.0 of the participants preferred to receive the HCV RNA results on the same day.
@highlight Same day delivery of PoCT results was feasible in 80 of the cases.
