 Studies have suggested that phthalates may be a risk factor for microalbuminuria whereas little is known regarding their nephrotoxic effects on adults . We enrolled 311 participants who provided questionnaire information as well as blood and urine samples from a nationally cross sectional study . Urinary phthalate metabolites were analyzed through liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry . From the renal function index we measured the serum level of blood urea nitrogen and the urinary levels of microalbumin albumin protein and creatinine . We used multiple logistic regressions and a cumulative risk assessment of renal effect to evaluate the relationship between phthalate exposure and renal function in our participants .

@highlight Phthalate is reported to be nephrotoxic in animal studies and can lead to chronic progressive nephropathy.
@highlight Moderate daily exposure to DEHP and integrate phthalate were clearly increased with urinary microalbumin BUN and protein.
@highlight The cumulative HI
@highlight significantly increased with microalbumin in participants over 18y.
@highlight The long term impact of phthalate requires further comprehensive or mechanistic study.
