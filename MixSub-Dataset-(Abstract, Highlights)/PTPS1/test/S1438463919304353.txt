 Among live births Down syndrome due to trisomy 21 is the most commonly occurring autosomal trisomy typically resulting from meiotic nondisjunction . Currently advanced maternal age and altered recombination patterns are the only well known risk factors for nondisjunction . Maternal occupation has not been investigated as a risk factor for maternally derived cases of trisomy 21 . This study explored the association between maternal occupation and chromosome 21 nondisjunction stratified by the stage of maternal error either Meiosis I or Meiosis II . Additionally we investigated specific toxic agents associated with occupation classes . Using narrative job descriptions from the National Down Syndrome Project a population based case control study occupation was coded using the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification . Odds ratios were calculated for the association between occupation class and having a child with DS stratified by meiotic stage . An exposure analysis was performed within occupational classes that were statistically significant predictors of having a child with DS . Odds ratios were calculated to analyze associations between individual exposures and having a child with DS . The odds of MII nondisjunction were increased among Production Workers . Women who worked as Life Physical and Social Scientists or in Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations experienced greater likelihood of MI errors and OR 1.87 respectively . Exposure to solvents within the Production Worker group was a significant predictor for MI nondisjunction . No other environmental agents had a significant association with nondisjunction . Specific maternal occupation classes were associated with MI and MII chromosome 21 nondisjunction . These occupation classes were selected for an exposure analysis which determined solvents as highly predictive of MI nondisjunction among Production Workers . Findings from this analysis will serve to further explore the relationship between maternal occupation and chromosome 21 nondisjunction .

@highlight Several occupation classes had greater odds of chromosome 21 nondisjunction NDJ .
@highlight Food Preparation and Serving Related occupations had increased odds of Meiosis I NDJ.
@highlight Life Physical and Social Science occupations had increased odds of Meiosis I NDJ.
@highlight Production Occupations had greater odds of Meiosis II NDJ.
@highlight Meiosis I nondisjunction was associated with solvent exposure among Production Work.
