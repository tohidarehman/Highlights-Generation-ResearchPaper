 Illicit drug use is associated with severe health related harms yet people who use drugs face substantial barriers to healthcare . We sought to identify factors associated with disclosure of drug use to a healthcare provider and describe differences in self reported quality of care received based on disclosure status . A client reported experience questionnaire on healthcare access and quality adapted from the World Health Organization Survey on Health and Health System Responsiveness was administered within two ongoing prospective cohort studies of PWUD in Vancouver Canada . Respondents not currently receiving addiction treatment were asked about experience of care and drug use disclosure to their most commonly accessed outpatient healthcare provider in the past 6 months . We used an adjusted logistic regression model to identify client characteristics associated with disclosure . From a total of 261 respondents less than half In a sample of PWUD accessing outpatient healthcare services we observed low rates of drug use disclosure particularly for Indigenous respondents and reduced quality of care for those who disclosed . These findings highlight the need for culturally safe and non stigmatizing care to address pervasive stereotyping in the healthcare system and improved screening for substance use disorder in outpatient healthcare services .

@highlight There is a need for culturally safe and non stigmatizing care to address pervasive stereotyping in the health care system towards Indigenous people and people who use drugs.
