 Smoking is an independent cause of cervical cancer which is the 4th most common malignancy in women . It is currently not known if tobacco consumption causes chromosomal damage in cervical cells and if age and the hormonal status have an impact on tobacco induced genetic instability in the cervix . We conducted a study with pre and post menopausal women smokers and never smokers . Smokers consumed 30 light medium cigarettes day and were matched with the non smoking group . Cervical cells were analyzed for induction of micronuclei which are caused by structural numerical chromosomal aberrations additionally other nuclear anomalies reflecting genomic instability and cytotoxicity were scored . Furthermore the frequencies of basal cells were recorded which reflect the mitotic activity of the mucosa . MN and other abnormalities were increased in both groups of smokers . The effects were most pronounced in postmenopausal smokers compared to premenopausal smokers . Also the number of basal cells was clearly enhanced in older women . Tar and nicotine had no detectable impact on chromosomal damage but a clear association with pack years was observed . Smoking increased chromosomal instability cytotoxicity and induced cell divisions in cervical mucosa cells of pre and post menopausal women . The effects were more pronounced in the latter group indicating a higher risk for diseases that are causally related to DNA damage .

@highlight Smoking causes chromosomal damage and acute cytotoxicity in cervix cells.
@highlight Smoking increases the mitotic activity of cervical cells.
@highlight These effects are more pronounced in post menopausal women.
@highlight The induction of DNA damage in cervical cells may cause adverse effects such as cancer.
