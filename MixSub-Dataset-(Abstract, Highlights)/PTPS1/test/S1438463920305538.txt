 Perfluoroalkyl substances are an emerging class of artificial environmental chemicals that have multiple potentially harmful effects on health . The largest Science Park in Taiwan discharges wastewater containing PFASs into the Keya River and a high concentration of PFASs has been found in this river and its aquatic creatures . We conducted a cross sectional study from 2016 to 2017 of 397 subjects aged 5575 years living near the river and evaluated the association of PFASs with metabolic syndrome and related outcomes . The results indicated that perfluorooctane sulfonate levels were positively associated with serum low density lipoprotein levels and that perfluorononanoic acid and PFOS levels were positively correlated with uric acid levels . Perfluorodecanoic acid and perfluoroundecanoic acid levels were negatively associated with serum triglyceride levels . After excluding lipid lowering drug users the association between certain PFAS levels and the LDL level was significantly enhanced but the downward trends of serum triglyceride levels were weakened . When stratified by sex PFNA perfluorohexanesulfonate and PFOS showed positive associations with the uric acid level only among males . In conclusion our results showed that associations were consistently null between PFASs and metabolic syndrome . PFAS levels were associated with serum lipids and lipid lowering drugs may interfere with this relationship . Certain PFASs were found to be positively associated with uric acid levels especially in males . Further studies are warranted to clarify the causal relationships .

@highlight New information has been reported for PFAS levels in Taiwanese adults who live in relatively high exposure areas.
@highlight The first study focuses on the health impact of PFASs on elderly people with potential long term exposure.
@highlight PFAS levels were associated with lipid profiles and lipid lowering drugs may interfere with these relationships.
@highlight Certain PFASs were found to be positively associated with uric acid levels especially in males.
