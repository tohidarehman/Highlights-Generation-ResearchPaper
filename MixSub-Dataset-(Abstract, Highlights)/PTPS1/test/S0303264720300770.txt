 The endosymbiosis theory most widely accepted variant surmises the engulfment of a bacterial cell by an archaeal cell . For decades this scenario was reputed to be an unconfirmed hypothesis and only recently it has obtained an indirect proof in Asgard archaea environmental DNA encoding eukaryotic signaturesactin cytoskeleton small GTPases and ESCRT complex . In view of growing interest to this aspect of the endosymbiosis theory it seemed timely to revisit the basic terms eukaryotic cell eukaryotes nucleated organisms . The article highlights the ambiguous applications of these terms and seeks for their consistency with regard to phylogeny and taxonomy . Additionally new name Caryosignifera is proposed for the phylum represented by the underexplored Asgard archaea manifested by above mentioned environmental DNA cultured species of engulfing Asgard archaea eukaryotic host cells in nucleated organisms .

@highlight Up to date endosymbiosis theory surmises the engulfment of bacteria by archaea.
@highlight Eukaryotic signatures in archaeal DNA argue for relationship with engulfing cells.
@highlight  In adequate use of terms eukaryotic cell eukaryotes nucleated organisms is shown.
@highlight Phylum name
@highlight is proposed for archaea that have eukaryote signatures.
