 Nearly all Americans have detectable concentrations of endocrine disrupting chemicals from consumer products in their bodies and expert panels recommend reducing exposures . To inform exposure reduction we investigated whether consumers who are trying to avoid certain chemicals in consumer products have lower exposures than those who are not . We also aimed to make exposure biomonitoring more widely available . We enrolled 726 participants in a crowdsourced biomonitoring study . We targeted phenolic compoundsspecifically parabens bisphenol A and analogs bisphenol F and bisphenol S the UV filter benzophenone 3 the anti microbial triclosan 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 5 dichlorophenoland collected survey data on consumer products cleaning habits and efforts to avoid related chemicals . We investigated associations between 68 self reported exposure behaviors and urine concentrations of ten chemicals and evaluated whether associations were modified by intention to avoid exposures . A large majority of participants reported taking steps to limit exposure to specific chemicals and overall participants achieved lower concentrations than the general U.S. population for parabens BPA triclosan and benzophenone 3 but not BPF and BPS . Participants who reported avoiding all four ingredient groupsparabens triclosan bisphenols and fragranceswere twice as likely as others to be in the lowest quartile of cumulative exposure . Avoiding certain products and reading ingredient labels to avoid chemicals was most effective for parabens triclosan and benzophenone 3 . Avoiding BPA was not effective for reducing bisphenol exposures . Avoiding certain chemicals in products was generally associated with reduced exposure for chemicals listed on labels . Greater ingredient transparency will help consumers who read labels to reduce their exposure to a wider range of potentially harmful chemicals . In order to more equitably address public health labeling policies should be complemented by regulations that exclude harmful chemicals from consumer products .
