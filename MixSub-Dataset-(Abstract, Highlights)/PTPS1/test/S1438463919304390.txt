 Residential green space may improve human health for example by promoting physical activity and by reducing stress . Conversely residential green space may increase stress by emitting aeroallergens and exacerbating allergic disease . Here we examine impacts of exposure to residential green space on distress in the susceptible subpopulation of adults sensitized to tree pollen allergens . In a panel study of 88 tree pollen allergy patients we analyzed self reported mental health perceived presence of allergenic trees near the residence and residential green space area within 1km distance and low green . Results were adjusted for patients background data and compared with distress in the general population . Short term distress was higher in the study population than in the general population . Residential green space had protective effects against short term distress low green per 10ha OR 0.85 . However distress was higher in patients who reported perceived presence of allergenic trees near their residence . Perceived presence of allergenic tree species in the neighbourhood of the residence of tree pollen allergy patients modulates the protective effect of residential green space against distress during the airborne tree pollen season .

@highlight We analyzed seasonal distress in a panel of 88 tree pollen allergy patients.
@highlight Distress was higher in allergy patients than in the general population.
@highlight Distress decreased with increasing residential green space within 1km distance.
@highlight Perceived presence of allergenic tree species was associated with higher distress.
