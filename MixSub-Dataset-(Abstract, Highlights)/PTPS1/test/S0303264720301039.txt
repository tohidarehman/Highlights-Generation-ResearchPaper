 Centrosome composed of two centrioles arranged in an orthogonal configuration is an indispensable cellular organelle for mitosis . 130 years after its discovery the structural functional relationship of centrosome is still obscure . Encouraged by the telltale signs of the Mouse and Magnet experiment Paul Schafer pioneered in the research on electromagnetism of centriole with electron microscopy in the late 1960s . Followed by the decades long slow progression of the field with sporadic reports indicating the electromagnetisms of mitosis . Piecing together the evidences we generated a mechanistic model for centrosome function during mitosis in which centrosome functions as an electronic generator . In particular the spinal rotations of centrioles transform the cellular chemical energy into cellular electromagnetic energy . The model is strongly supported by multiple experimental evidences . It offers an elegant explanation for the self organized orthogonal configuration of the two centrioles in a centrosome that is through the dynamic electromagnetic interactions of both centrioles of the centrosome .

@highlight We provide a model to describe centrosome function in correlation with its structural organizations.
@highlight We suggested electromagnetic field is the missing link for centrosome function during mitosis.
@highlight We offered physical explanations for the orthogonal self organization structural features of centrosome.
@highlight We provided multiple detailed evidences to support the electromagnetic model we built for centrosome function.
