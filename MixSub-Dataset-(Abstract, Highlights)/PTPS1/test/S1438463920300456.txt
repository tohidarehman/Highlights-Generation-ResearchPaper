 Despite the positive association between secondhand smoke and cardiovascular diseases no comprehensive assessment on the dose response relationship between SHS and CVD has yet been reported . Therefore a meta analysis was conducted to update the binary association and to elucidate the dose response relationship of both self reported and objectively measured SHS exposure with CVD . PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published up to November 12 2019 . Random effects models were used to assess the summary odds ratios of CVD with SHS exposure . Restricted cubic splines were used to fit the dose response relationship . Fifty five eligible observational studies were included in this meta analysis to investigate the association between SHS exposure and CVD . Based on the meta analysis the pooled OR of CVD was 1.22 for the self reported SHS individuals as comparing to the non exposed group . The result of restricted cubic splines showed a risk plateau of SHS exposure at 15 cigarettes per day Exposure to SHS is associated with an increased risk of CVD regardless of the modes . And thus well enforced smoke free laws could possibly reduce a substantial risk of CVD caused by SHS .

@highlight Nonsmokers exposed to SHS had a 22 higher risk of cardiovascular diseases.
@highlight A risk plateau of CVD was observed on SHS exposure at 15 cigarettes per day.
@highlight The PAF of CVD for SHS exposure in Asia was much higher than that in America.
@highlight Any exposure to SHS was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk.
