 What is life and Erwin Schrdinger s answer negative entropy inspired researchers in the 20th century to unite physics chemistry and physiology into a new synthesis that many believe to be an important foundation for life science today . Decades after Schrdinger life scientists are still fascinated by the riddle that entropy can only accumulate in physical systems which often leads to biological deterioration and death but life finds ways to persist and prevail . So to say life negates entropy . Can this fascination and research concept be broadened even further to human culture Short after Schrdinger s publication Claude Shannon coined the term information entropy . Information entropy accumulates when noise interferes during communication . Eventually all useful information is lost . Yet from this observation something surprising can be inferred . Not only biological life but also cultural life has the ability to persist and prevail in spite of the accumulation of entropy . Does this insight mean that cultural life also negates entropy in Schrdinger s sense These questions guided me over several years of research during which I developed and tested a new theory of culture based on variation selection processes and homeostatic regulation . My contribution is to discover that these two processes not only make statements about biological life . They also explain some of the most important phenomena of culture returning fashions polarization diversification cycles of growth and reform and the formation of common ethos across entire bodies of knowledge . With access to big data and supercomputing I tested my theory against hundreds of thousands of news magazine articles books and TV transcripts as well as textual content collected from the social media . Historical institutional and geographical information was extracted from these data using a new method and new interactive tools were created to interpret the results . What should not be missed when reading this article is that the theory proposed here reveals a striking equivalence between nature and culture . The article states this equivalence in mathematical terms and contextualizes it in the history of science . The mathematical breakthrough is relevant because it aligns the humanities to science while also allowing for live evaluation of what I call cultural diversification cycles .

@highlight In cultural life the unit of evolutionary selection is not the isolated idea but the group of interrelated ideas.
@highlight Between multiple units of evolutionary selection there is homeostatic regulation. Within the units there are variation selection processes.
@highlight Variation selection processes make the theoretical link between Shannon communication and dimensionality reductions such as topic modeling .
@highlight Homeostatic regulation explains fashions cultural diversification as well as the evolution of common ethos across entire bodies of knowledge.
@highlight Diversification is a distinct sixth type of cooperation present in both nature and culture.
