 The cytoskeleton of cilia and flagella is so called axoneme a stable cylindrical architecture of nine microtubule doublets . Axoneme performs periodic bending motion by utilizing specific dynein motor family powered by ATP hydrolysis . It is still unclear how this highly organized ciliary beat is being initiated and strongly coordinated by the combined action of hundreds dynein motors . Based on the experimental evidences we here elaborate a plausible scenario in which actually calcium ions play the roles of catalytic activators and coordinators of dynein attachments doing it in superposition with already known mechanical control tools of ciliary beat . Polyelectrolyte properties of microtubules incorporated in axoneme doublets enable the formation and propagation of soliton like ionic clouds of Ca

@highlight Calcium signaling impacts the bending of cilia and flagella in terms of regulation of dynein motor activities.
@highlight Ca
@highlight signaling is guided by microtubules doublets within axoneme and it has the form of bell shaped ionic clouds.
@highlight The speed and stability of ionic clouds provides a precise and efficient way for Ca
@highlight distribution.
