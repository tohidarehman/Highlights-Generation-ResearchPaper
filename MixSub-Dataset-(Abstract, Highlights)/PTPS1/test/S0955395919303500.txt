 Despite several sources corroborating an expanding market and increased visibility and greater diversity in users profiles very little is known about the number of crack cocaine users in France . The estimates rely on a single data source capturerecapture method . Annual data are extracted from treatment centres nationwide . To account for heterogeneity we use an innovative zero truncated geometric regression based estimator controlling for individual and centre characteristics . We use the well known Zelterman estimator as a benchmark . The number of crack cocaine users received in treatment centres increased dramatically from 3388 in 2010 to 5143 in 2017 . The estimated number of crack cocaine users is believed to have tripled over the course of the same period to 28983 respectively with prevalences below 1 similar to other European countries . The coverage rate decreased in a similar fashion indicating lower utilization . In particular females and younger users are underestimated by data from treatment centres . The prevalence of crack cocaine use is fairly low but steadily increasing . The diversity in users profiles is a challenge to prevention and public health policies that should expand their scope to a more inclusive perspective of what defines crack cocaine users . Our method overcomes several methodological issues and can be easily applied to a wide range of settings .

@highlight Recent qualitative in the field studies conducted in France have shown an increasing visibility and diversity in the profiles of crack cocaine users.
@highlight This study provides the first reliable estimates of crack cocaine users in France using an innovative capturerecapture framework accounting for high heterogeneity.
@highlight Similar to other European countries crack cocaine use in France remains fairly low but is steadily increasing.
@highlight Our results show an increase in female and economically more advantaged users the spreading of crack cocaine toward more advantaged users and new geographic areas.
@highlight As these groups are underrepresented in treatment treatment centres should be provided the means to effectively handle the increasing heterogeneity of crack cocaine users.
