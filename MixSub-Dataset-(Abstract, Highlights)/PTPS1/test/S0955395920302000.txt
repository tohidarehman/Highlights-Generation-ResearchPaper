 In some U.S. states laws prohibit sales of recreational marijuana to intoxicated customers to prevent associated harms . In alcohol markets training in responsible sales practices is one intervention to help reduce such sales to intoxicated customers . Similar training may be beneficial in the recreational cannabis market . An online responsible marijuana vendor training was developed . Among its five modules learning elements taught store personnel to recognize signs of alcohol impairment and intoxication refuse sales and understand the risks of driving under the influence of cannabis . A sample of Deterrence of sales to intoxicated customers does not seem to exist regardless of whether the states laws prohibit it . Only 16 of 146 stores refused sales . There was no difference in refusal rates between intervention and control stores Training in responsible sales practices alone did not appear to reduce sales to apparently alcohol intoxicated customers . Legal deterrence from making these sales may be insufficient or nonexistent for store management to support adherence to this responsible sales practice . Regulatory and policy actions may be needed to increase perceived risk with such sales to achieve training s benefits .
