 Biomass derived porous carbon materials have attracted considerable attention as promising electromagnetic wave absorbers due to their lightweight characteristic ultra large surface area as well as high dielectric loss . However the dielectric loss alone is difficult to achieve high EM wave absorption performance . In this work core shell

@highlight The micromorphology of composites could be easily tuned by changing cobalt salt amounts.
@highlight Multicomponent endows the multiple loss mechanism to attenuate electromagnetic EM wave.
@highlight The optimal EM wave absorption could up to 89.3dB and broad effective bandwidth is 6.08GHz.
