 Due to the multiple dimensional and embeddable characterizations the three dimensional woven structure is of great potential as a platform for multifunctional composites . As an example of this concept we proposed a light weight and high gain three dimensional woven spacer microstrip antenna for the first time by integrating microstrip antenna into 3D woven spacer composites . The single element 3DWS MA showed superb electromagnetic performance with the gain value of 7.1dB which is more than four orders of magnitude higher than traditional microstrip antenna . Furthermore the 3DWS MA maintained proper resonant frequency and impedance matching after the impact of 18J exhibiting excellent structural integrity .
