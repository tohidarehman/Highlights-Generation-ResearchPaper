 Considering the reduction of fire hazards associated with the application of epoxy resin composites . Herein a novel sodium containing polyhedral oligomeric phenyl silsesquioxane has been synthesized through hydrolysis condensation . FTIR NMR and MALDI TOF MS results reveal that Na Ph POSS is a hepta phenyl POSS consisting of SiONa and SiOH groups . Compared to pure EP according to the combustion results the peak of heat release rate the maximum smoke density and the peak of CO production rate of EP 5wt Na Ph POSS significantly decrease by 45.9 45.1 and 46.9 respectively . Additionally EP composites endowed with Na Ph POSS have low dielectric constant and dielectric loss . Therefore eco friendly multifunctional Na Ph POSS provides a promising prospect for mitigating the fire hazards of EP composites .

@highlight A novel metal POSS Na Ph POSS is firstly synthesized via one pot method.
@highlight Na Ph POSS can significantly reduce the diffusion of heat smoke and CO of EP.
