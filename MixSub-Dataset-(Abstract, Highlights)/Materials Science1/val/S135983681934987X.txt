 High performance thermal insulating materials are greatly needed in many areas . Polyimide aerogels by freeze drying method have shown great potential as thermal insulating materials . Improving the mechanical performance of polyimide aerogels meanwhile without deteriorating their thermal insulating performance is very significative . In this work a significant homogeneity reinforcement of polyimide aerogels has been achieved by using electrospun polyimide nanofibers as the reinforcing fillers . Short nanofibers could improve strength and toughness of polyimide aerogels by dispersing stress along the pore wall and nanofibers via mechanical interlocking effect due to the good compatibility between them . Consequently the nanofiber reinforced polyimide aerogels exhibit better structural formability and excellent mechanical performance showing compressive modulus of 3.7MPa with a density of 54.4mgcm
