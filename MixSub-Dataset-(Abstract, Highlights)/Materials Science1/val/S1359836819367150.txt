 Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene is widely used in bearing components . However in this type of application wear issues leading to formation of debris in regions near the implant may arise causing inflammation of the tissue . Due to this this paper seeks to improve surface properties by the deposition of Ti Zr and Ta thin films on the surface of UHMWPE by magnetron sputtering . It was possible to define which of the deposited films presented better results . Metallic coatings with thicknesses ranging from 288 to 440nm showed a significant improvement in wettability hardness toughness and roughness . In addition they showed excellent adhesion strength front to pull off and nanoscratch tests and no contaminants in the compositional analyzes performed by Rutherford backscatter spectrometry . From an electrochemical viewpoint the order of choice for metal coating over UHMWPE would be Ta Ti and Zr respectively . Overall these coatings offer an improved surface for biomedical applications especially when mechanical stresses are required .
