 This paper presents the modelling and failure analysis of 3D printed woven composite plates with a hole under tensile and shear loading . In the finite element software woven cells are built using stacking sequences which are then linked together to form the FE model of the woven laminate . According to the 3D printing experiments tailored fibre placement is achieved in the simulation by altering the fibre orientation around a region to leave a hole . In order to compare this placement technique with that of a control group drilled samples with the notch removed via mechanical machining was proposed . Three cases open hole laminates under tensile loading and double shear and single shear loading are studied to advance the understanding of the failure mechanisms . Good agreement between numerical and experimental results has been obtained which exhibits a similar trend of strength improvement using new placement technique . The distribution of principal strain and displacement in the modelling are consistent with the results obtained from Digital Image Correlation and Micro X ray Computed Tomography . It suggests that the avoidance of fibre breakage and the overlap of printed materials around the hole can dramatically increase the failure strength and prevent the propagation of cracks .

@highlight Finite element models for 3D printed woven CFRP composites with holes were established.
@highlight Tailored fibre placement to leave a hole was considered and compared with traditional drilling method.
@highlight Avoidance of fibre breakage and overlap of printed materials increase the strength and prevent the propagation of cracks.
@highlight The numerical results are supported by the experimental results obtained from DIC and Micro CT scanning.
