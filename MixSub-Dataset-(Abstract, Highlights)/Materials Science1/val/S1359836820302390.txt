 Weak interfacial interactions always restricted and weakened the properties of the composite materials and constituted a primary bottleneck . Herein under the guidance of bioinspired engineering thought and inimitable structural features of hyperbranched polymers a series of designed multilevel core shell 1 3 5 triamino 2 4 6 trinitrobenzene particles by

@highlight A series of multilevel core shell interfacial structures were successfully realized on energetic particle surface.
@highlight High efficiency mechanical enhancement was achieved relying on this structural design strategy.
@highlight A completely new recognition of the rough hierarchical or fractal interfaces was firstly obtained by aid of SANS.
@highlight A ternary synergetic interface enhancement mechanism has been proposed.
