 To improve the strength and toughness of Mg matrix composites we propose a novel strategy to successfully develop Mg matrix composites reinforced with alternating fiber like nanoparticle rich zones . A combination of in situ casting and hot thermomechanical processing approach is employed to achieve this unique microstructure and the influence of spatial arrangement of TiB

@highlight Mg matrix composite reinforced with specific spatial arrangement of TiB
@highlight nanoparticles is developed.
@highlight Designed nanocomposite consists of alternative fiber like NPR and NPF zones.
@highlight Superior combination of tensile strength 388MPa and ductility 10.1 is realized.
@highlight The hard NPR and soft NPF zones are responsible for strengthening and toughening nanocomposite respectively.
