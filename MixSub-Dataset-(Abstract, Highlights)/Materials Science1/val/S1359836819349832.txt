 One pack flame retardant epoxy resins with long pot life before using high curing activity during operating and satisfactory fire safety after curing are extremely needed in electrical electronics and composite industries . Here imidazolium diphenylphosphinate was designed and synthesized by a facile way thereafter used as a hardener for diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A type EP . IDPP DGEBA possessed long term stability in liquid state at ambient temperature while cured rapidly under heating presenting controllable latent curing behavior relying on temperature . Specific phosphorus containing groups were finally attached to epoxy chains mainly by ionic bonds thus slightly affected the network structures of the resins . Consequently the cured EP simultaneously achieved high glass transition temperature T

@highlight Novel phosphorus containing imidazolium was applied as latent hardener for EP.
@highlight The unique structure of the cured resins was never reported elsewhere.
@highlight The cured resins exhibited excellent comprehensive performance.
