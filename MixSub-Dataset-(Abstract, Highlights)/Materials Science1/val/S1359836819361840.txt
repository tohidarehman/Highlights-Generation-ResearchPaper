 Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers have been used as a potential strengthening material due to the many advantages they possess over conventional strengthening materials in recent times . Their successful applications in strengthening concrete columns have also led to CFRP being used as an external strengthening material in steel columns . However the lack of knowledge of the fire performance characteristics of CFRP has hindered the CFRP usage in steel columns which require structural fire ratings . Therefore this two phase experimental investigation was aimed at investigating the effect of fire on the structural performance of CFRP strengthened short Square Hollow Section steel columns . In the first phase CFRP strengthened short SHS columns were exposed to steady state fire conditions and tested under axial compression until failure . The test results exhibited a severe degradation of the ultimate axial compression capacity beyond the glass transition temperature of the adhesive and showed that the effect of CFRP has diminished completely at 225C . In the second phase CFRP strengthened short SHS columns were insulated with a spray applied insulation material and exposed to standard fire under three load conditions . The standard fire test results showed that the CFRP strengthened and insulated columns were able to achieve more than 60min of fire rating under 0.2 load ratio suggesting satisfactory fire resistance level . This paper presents the details of the investigation and its results .

@highlight Investigated the fire behaviour of CFRP strengthened steel tubular columns with and without insulation.
@highlight Conducted steady state tests of CFRP strengthened SHS steel columns at elevated temperatures.
@highlight Investigated the axial compression capacity reduction of CFRP strengthened columns with increasing temperature.
@highlight Conducted three standard fire tests of CFRP strengthened SHS steel columns with insulation.
@highlight Observed satisfactory FRLs for CFRP strengthened columns protected with insulation.
