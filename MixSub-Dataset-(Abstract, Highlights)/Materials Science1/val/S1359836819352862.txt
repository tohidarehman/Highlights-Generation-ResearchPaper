 Hard soft interface plays a role in the properties of the composite metal based magnets while it is less talked in the composite permanent oxide magnets on the magnetic interaction and properties due to easy interdiffusion . Here multilayer thin films composed with hard CoFe

@highlight Multilayer CFO LSMO films without interdiffusion were derived in a low cost way.
@highlight Room temperature rigid loops with a H
@highlight 8.27kOe and a BH 
@highlight 2.4MGOe are clear.
@highlight Optimize interface and grain play a role in the rigid coupling composite magnet.
