 Effective improvement molecular orientation in the amorphous region and regulating crystallization transformation behavior is of great significance for the industrial production of ultra strength polycaprolactam fiber . In this work the effects of adding a small quantity of high molecular weight polycaprolactam on the crystal transformation melt viscoelasticity molecular orientation and mechanical properties of HSPA6 fibers were systematically investigated . The results indicated that HmwPA increased the elastic modulus and loss modulus of HSPA6 melt and suppressed molecular relaxation during drawing to form a crystal structure dominated by form . As such the tensile strength and elongation at break of HSPA6 fiber reached 10.32 cN dtex and 18.7 respectively . 1D and 2D wide angle X ray diffraction small angle X ray scattering and birefringence observations demonstrated that the HmwPA not only inhibited the destruction of the crystal structure during fiber drawing but also increased the molecular orientation in the amorphous region from 63.1 to 70.1 while maintaining the crystal orientation to about 95 .

@highlight The molecular chain orientation is improved by entanglements.
@highlight Industrial polycaprolactam fibers with a tensile modulus of 1.08GPa were prepared.
@highlight The mechanical property of HSPA6 fibers reached 10.32 cN dtex and 18.7 .
