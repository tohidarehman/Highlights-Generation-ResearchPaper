 Electromagnetic interference shielding composites are inevitably damaged in the long term usage which would affect the regular operation of the devices . Hence the demand for materials with healable and reliable EMI shielding performance has increased . Here a flexible conductive composite owning both selfhealing and EMI shielding functions is facilely developed with carbon nanotubes as conductive filler and dynamically crosslinked polyurethane bearing DielsAlder bonds as polymer matrix . The PUDA CNT composite shows a high EMI shielding effectiveness of 30.7dBat 5.0wt CNT loading in the range of X band . And the EMI SE can recover from 16.8dB for damaged state to 29.8dB after three times cut healing cycles revealing excellent EMI SE retention of 97.1 . The PUDA CNT composite also exhibits healable tensile properties with an elongation at break up to 571 31 at 2.0wt CNT content and self healing efficiency of 89.2 after the repeatable healing . This work demonstrates a healable EMI shielding composite which ensures the reliability and long time use under harsh conditions .
