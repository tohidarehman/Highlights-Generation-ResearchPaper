 Graphitization is an important post treatment of carbon carbon composites . Carbon nanotubes as a means of reinforcement have been explored extensively in C C composites . In this study CNTs were grafted on the carbon fiber and subsequently densified to delve into the effect of CNT on microstructure residual thermal stress evolution as well as the mechanical strength retention rate in the course of the heat treatment . Pure C C and CNT C C composites were heat treated at three temperatures namely 1600C 2100C and 2450C . As suggested from the results CNT facilitated the transition from the turbostratic structure to the ideal graphite structure . According to the results of measurement and finite element analysis the presence of CNT decreased and concentratedly distributed the residual thermal stress . In pure C C composites after undergoing 2450C heat treatment the MSR of out of plane compression strength in plane compression strength and interlaminar shearing strength reached 53.07 45.27 and 41.16 respectively while these in CNT C C composites were 69.69 66.33 and 69.70 respectively . CNT noticeably mitigated the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties they also reduced the effect on the anisotropy of mechanical properties . By impacting the microstructure and residual thermal stress distribution of the composites CNT had further effects on the loading capacity and fracture mode and finally protected the composites during the high temperature heat treatment and up regulated the MSR of CNT C C composites .

@highlight CNT accelerate the transition of PyC from turbostratic structure to ideal graphite structure. CNT refined PyC matrix contributes to high anti destructive capability which helps composites maintain the integrity and continuity of the composites even after heat treatment.
@highlight Residual thermal stress was measured by Raman scattering intensity contour map and calculated by finite element analysis. The introducing of CNT reduces the anisotropic of PyC which results in a small and even distribution of residual thermal stress and avoids the destruction of PyC matrix during the heat treatment.
@highlight In CNT C C composites integrity composites structure accompanied with lower and evenly distributed residual thermal stress leads to higher MSR. Compared with pure C C composites both matrix and fiber dominated properties have been enhanced after heat treatment in CNT C C composites which means CNT can effectively mitigate the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties and inhibit the effect on the mechanical properties anisotropy.
