 Currently numerous studies are devoted to the pursuit of thermal conductivity enhancement of phase change materials . On the contrary few researches are reported to reduce the thermal conductivity of PCMs . Generally the PCMs with reduced thermal conductivity have great potential in thermal protection application . Herein we propose a novel in situ one step strategy to facilely prepare monolithic silica aerogel based composite PCMs . The silica aerogels possess low thermal conductivity and are used to encapsulate PCMs to prepare composite PCMs such as polyethylene glycol or octadecanol . Compare with
