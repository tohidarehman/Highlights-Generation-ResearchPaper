 With the purpose to obtain an eco friendly flame retardant for epoxy resin a facile method for the synthesis of a bio based epoxy monomer containing DOPO units from lignin derived vanillin and guaiacol was presented in this work . During the synthesis process guaiacol acted as both reactant and solvent . And it could be recycled in situ and re used as the fresh one . In order to evaluate the flame retardancy of DGEBDB it was mixed with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A and cured with 4 4 diaminodiphenylmethane . Results showed that DGEBDB demonstrated a good compatibility with DGEBA and the mechanical properties of cured resins were obviously improved with the addition of DGEBDB . As expected the limiting oxygen index of cured resin reached 30.2 with the content of phosphorus only 0.67wt in which the weight ratio between DGEBDB and DGEBA was 1 9 . When the weight ratio of DGEBDB to DGEBA was further increased to 2 8 for the B2D8 DDM system the UL 94 V 0 grade was achieved . Meanwhile the mechanism of DGEBDB in improving the flame retardancy of cured resin was discussed and revealed . This easily available and eco friendly DGEBDB was proved to be a highly efficient reactive flame retardant for epoxy resin .

@highlight A high efficient flame retardant for epoxy was synthesized from the renewable resource.
@highlight Guaiacol acted as both reactant and solvent it could be recycled and re used.
@highlight The flame retardant showed very good compatibility with DGEBA.
@highlight UL 94 V0 grade epoxy was achieved with the phosphorus content was only 1.27 .
