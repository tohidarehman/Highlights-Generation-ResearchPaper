 Hydrogels consisting lots of water resemble the human soft tissues but their disordered structures and weak mechanical properties usually limit their biomedical applications . Herein a facile strategy to prepare highly ordered nanocomposite hydrogels with ultrahigh strength is reported where the oriented tunicate cellulose nanocrystals were locked in polymeric networks . Firstly a stretchable supramolecular hydrogel was prepared by loosely crosslinking adamantine moiety contained polymers with

@highlight A new strategy was used to fabricate nanocomposite hydrogels with high performance.
@highlight Tunicate cellulose nanocrystals were aligned by prestretching and locked by electrostatic interaction in hydrogel networks.
@highlight The resultant hydrogels showed anisotropic structure and ultrahigh mechanical strength.
