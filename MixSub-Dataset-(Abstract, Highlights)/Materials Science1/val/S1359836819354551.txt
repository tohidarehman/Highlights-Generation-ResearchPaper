 Hexavalent chromium Cr is a well known heavy metal widely existing in wastewater due to various anthropogenic activities . Cr ions are not biodegradable and tend to be toxic both in flora and fauna . Therefore effective removal of Cr has become a very important procedure for treating Cr containing wastewater . Here we developed a facile strategy for constructing ZnO sheets with defective zeolite imidazolate frameworks 8 to form visible light driven

@highlight An
@highlight synthesis strategy is used to synthesize
@highlight composite.
@highlight Self defects in
@highlight composite expand a visible light absorption band.
@highlight The
@highlight exhibits improved visible light photoreduction ability of Cr VI .
