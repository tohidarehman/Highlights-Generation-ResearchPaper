 The trend of miniaturization integration and multi function of modern electronics leads to the speedily increased power density which makes heat dissipation a crucial issue . Herein epoxy based composites with highly enhanced through plane thermal conductivity were successfully prepared by constructing a free standing and vertically aligned silicon carbide nanowires SiC

@highlight Vertically aligned and free standing network of SiC
@highlight  BNNS was constructed by filtration.
@highlight The maximum results of 4.22 W mK through plane and 1.43 W mK in plane were obtained at low filler loading.
@highlight Exceptional heat dissipation capability was demonstrated by theoretical simulation and chip heat sink application.
