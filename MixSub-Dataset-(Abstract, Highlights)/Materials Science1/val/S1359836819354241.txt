 Last years have witnessed great advances in minimizing the flammability of the polylactic acid bioplastic . Unfortunately to date there remains an urgent lack of a facile strategy to develop highly effective flame retardants for PLA . Herein we report one pot scalable fabrication of an oligomeric phosphoramide phenyl phosphonic piperazine

@highlight An oligomeric polyphosphoramide PPP was facilely synthesized by a one pot condensation reaction.
@highlight The PLA PPP composites exhibit unique submicron grained microstructures.
@highlight Adding only 3wt PPP enables PLA to achieve V 0 rating and an LOI value as high as 32.5 .
@highlight The flame retardancy of PPP is mainly attributed to the radical quenching effect of and gas dilution effects.
@highlight The final PLA maintains high mechanical strength due to uniform dispersion of PPP and strong interfaces.
