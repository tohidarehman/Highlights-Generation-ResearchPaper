 The results findings and analytical investigation of an experimental study conducted on the hydrostatic implosion of filament wound carbon fiber epoxy composite tubes within partial confinement are presented . Implosion in geometries varying in length and diameter is initiated within a tubular confining structure with one end closed and one end open to a free field hydrostatic environment . Structural deformation behavior is captured and quantified using high speed cameras in conjunction with 3D digital image correlation . Water hammer pulses resulting from implosion are measured at various locations in the confining chamber and are shown to behave as a damped harmonic oscillator . Water hammer behavior is thus experimentally characterized for each geometry by determining average values of amplitude

@highlight Pressure resulting from the partially confined implosion is heavily dependent on the volume of air bounded by the implodable.
@highlight A simplified analytical methodology for the determination of the pressure pulse is presented for the case in question.
@highlight Partially confined implosion of composite structures at low
@highlight results in a brief dwell in the implosion process.
@highlight Frequency of pressure oscillations
@highlight resulting from partially confined implosion is predicted with excellent accuracy.
