 Flammability feature of combustible polymer foam materials often causes massive casualties and property loss and it is therefore urgent to develop a green and high efficiency strategy that can reduce or avoid the fire blaze disasters . Here an extremely simple water based coating approach is proposed to prepare mechanically flexible super hydrophobic and flame retardant polyurethane foam nanocomposites with high efficiency fire warning response . The hybrid ammonium polyphosphate graphene oxide is decorated onto the PU foam surface via electrostatic interactions followed by surface silane functionalization . Interestingly the silane and APP molecules present selective distributions on the GO and thus form micro nano rough surface with low water affinity to achieve super hydrophobicity . Meanwhile such hybrid APP GO silane coatings produce synergistic flame resistance for the PU foam materials which is attributed to the formation of compact and uniform P Si elements co covered rGO layer on the foam surface . Further the hybrid coatings can provide high efficiency fire warning response under complicated conditions e.g . flame detection response time of only 2.0s and excellent fire early warning time in pre combustion . Therefore this work provides new perspectives to design and develop multi functional coatings for fire safety and prevention applications .
