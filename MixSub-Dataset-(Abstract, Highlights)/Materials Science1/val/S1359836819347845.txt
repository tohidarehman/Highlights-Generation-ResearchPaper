 The dynamic responses of continuous graded foams are investigated experimentally and numerically . The Voronoi model is employed to construct foam specimens . Graded foams with different gradients and uniform foams with different relative densities are fabricated by the additive manufacturing technique . Experimental results indicate that the gradient distribution notably influences the mechanical properties of foams under a low velocity impact . If the lowest density region is close to one end of a specimen this end will present a gradually increasing plateau stage in the stress strain curve . While if the highest density region is placed to one end this end will exhibit a sharp fluctuation before the gradually increasing plateau stage . Besides the crushing behaviors of graded and uniform foams are compared to propose an elastic collapse plastic hardening densification constitutive model . The E C PH D model can predict the dynamic mechanical properties of graded foams with successive layered deformation . A high velocity impact study is also carried out by the numerical simulation . The impact end of graded foams shows distinct higher stresses than the support end due to the shock wave effect . The combined effects of gradient and shock wave on the crushing responses of foams are discussed systematically .
