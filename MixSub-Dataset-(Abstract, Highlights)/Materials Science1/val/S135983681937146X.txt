 In this work an impregnated carbon fiber carbon nanotubes hybrid fiber mat with excellent ability to enhance mechanical property was fabricated via combining electrophoretic deposition process and the following solution pre impregnation treatment . Their effects on the mechanical and electrical properties of carbon fiber reinforced polycarbonate matrix composites were systematically investigated . The results showed that the functionalized CNTs were uniformly coated on CF surface after the EPD treatment and the nano coating enhanced the contact area and surface wettability of CF . Coupled with the solution pre impregnation treatment the CF CNTs fiber bundles were fully impregnated by PC matrix and the interface connection was also improved . Compared with CF PC composites mechanical property was improved significantly . The tensile strength and modulus were improved by 46.5 and 57.5 respectively surpassing most of the reported values . The impact strength 36.5kJ m

@highlight The impregnated carbon fiber carbon nanotubes CF CNTs hybrid fiber mat with excellent ability to enhance mechanical property was fabricated via combining electrophoretic deposition EPD process and the following solution pre impregnation treatment.
@highlight CNTs nano coating introduced by EPD treatment to CF surface increased the contact area reduced the stress concentration while the increase in the wettability and roughness also provides close molecular contact between the CF CNTs and the PC matrix.
@highlight The solution pre impregnation treatment was adopted after EPD treatment to prevent CNTs from easily detaching from the CF surface and to make the CF CNTs fiber bundles fully impregnated by PC resin thus enhanced the interface connection.
@highlight The impregnated CF CNTs hybrid fibers have excellent mechanical reinforcement function. Compared with CF PC composites the tensile strength 344.8MPa and modulus 37.8GPa were improved by 46.5 and 57.5 respectively. The impact strength 36.5kJ m
@highlight  and storage modulus 49.0GPa obtained the 268.7 and 78.4 increment respectively. In addition the through thickness electrical conductivity achieved 53.8 improvement.
