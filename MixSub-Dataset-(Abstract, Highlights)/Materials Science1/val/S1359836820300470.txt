 Stretchable conductive polymer composites are important in the field of flexible electronic devices in which stretchable conductive silicone rubber composites has drawn great attention . However the poor mechanical properties of the SR composites limit their practical application . How to compensate this drawback without compromising its electrical conductivity is an issue deserved to investigate . Herein conductive carbon black grafted with a silicone coupling agent was prepared by free radical polymerization and further reacted with carbon nanotube to obtain a new carbon black carbon nanotube hybrid filler . This hybrid filler can not only improve the mechanical properties of silicone rubber composites but also greatly enhance their electrical conductivity . Consequently a silicone rubber composite with 5.76vol hybrid filler has high tensile strength and elongation at break . The minimum conductive percolation threshold and maximum conductivity of the composite are 0.24vol and 248.8S m respectively . Besides the composite has high strain sensitivity and superior deformation recovery performance and can be applied to detect human motion behavior under a low strain . The preparation method of the hybrid filler provides a novel approach to the preparation and production of stretchable conductive composites with good mechanical properties and potential application for flexible electronic devices .
