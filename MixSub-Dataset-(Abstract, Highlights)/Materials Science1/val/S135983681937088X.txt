 Hydrogels with exceptional mechanical properties at high water content are crucial need for practical applications in various fields . However achieving a hydrogel possessed splendid mechanical performance with well trade off between tensile strength and toughness is highly demanded due to the mechanical weakness of conventional hydrogel . Herein we report a novel kind of nanocomposite hydrogel developed by integrating chitosan decorated halloysite nanotubes into dual cross linked structure composed of chemical and Fe

@highlight Chitosan decorated halloysite nanotubes are served as effective reinforcement in hydrogel system.
@highlight The nanocomposite hydrogel displays prominent and balanced mechanical properties.
@highlight Excellent self recovery property can be achieved for the nanocomposite hydrogel.
@highlight Nanoparticle reinforcement and physical interactions contribute to enhanced mechanical properties.
