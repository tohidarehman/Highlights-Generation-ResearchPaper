 The creation of high performance polylactic acid materials combining excellent mechanical robustness and flame retardant performances are essential to meet demanding performances requirements for their practical applications in industry . Despite encouraging advances current strategies by introducing toughening agents and flame retardants usually show compromised mechanical strength ductility because of the irrational interphase reaction design of multi component polymer blends . To date it remains challenging to robust and flame retardant PLA

@highlight Advanced PLA ESO APP ternary blends have been rationally designed
@highlight manipulating interphase reactions.
@highlight As designed PLA ESO APP blend exhibits a large extensibility of 165 and a fracture toughness as high as 46MJ m
@highlight The PLA ESO APP ternary blend retains a high tensile strength of 42.0MPa.
@highlight The PLA ESO APP blend can pass a V 0 rating in addition to showing a high LOI of 30.2 .
