 By harnessing the benefits from both construction and demolition waste recycling and geopolymer binders geopolymeric recycled aggregate concrete can contribute to the green and eco friendly construction material products . In this study the compressive behavior of GRAC based on fly ash and slag was experimentally investigated under both quasi static and dynamic loadings . Quasi static compressive tests were performed by using a high force servo hydraulic test system while dynamic compressive tests were carried out by using a 80 mm split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus . The compressive properties of GRAC under dynamic loading including stress strain curves energy absorption capability and failure modes were obtained and compared with those under quasi static loading . The results show that the compressive properties of GRAC exhibit a strong strain rate dependency . Although the recycled aggregate replacement decreases the quasi static compressive strength it exhibits a slight effect on the compressive strength at high strain rates . The dynamic increase factor for compressive strength exhibits an significant increasing trend with the recycled aggregate replacement . On the other hand the incorporation of slag increases the quasi static compressive strength dynamic compressive strength and DIF . As for the energy absorption capacity a minor enhancement is achieved with the recycled aggregate replacement while a significant improvement is identified after the inclusion of slag . Empirical DIF formulae for compressive strength of GRAC are proposed in which the DIF increases approximately linearly with the strain rate in a logarithmic manner .
