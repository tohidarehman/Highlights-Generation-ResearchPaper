 Flame retardancy and corrosion resistance required by high performance epoxy resins especially in the field of composites and coating are difficult to achieve simultaneously . In this study a facile method was put forward to impart both flame retardant and anti corrosive properties to epoxy resins via chemically introducing bifunctional phosphorus containing triazole derivatives . In the resultant epoxy thermosets the phosphorylated triazole structure directly contributed to flame retardancy while the triazole structure can effectively suppress the electrochemical corrosion . With only 5wt loading of DATA the epoxy thermoset showed excellent flame retardancy with a high limiting oxygen index of 33.2 V 0 rating in UL 94 tests and significant suppression of heat and smoke release in cone calorimetry tests . Meanwhile the electrochemical corrosion tests confirmed that the corrosion protection efficiency of EP 5 wt D ATA increased by 95.3 in comparison to neat EP . Due to hydrogen bonding and interactions caused by the introduction of D ATA the versatile epoxy thermoset also had enhanced mechanical properties with the improved tensile and flexural strength . Moreover the anti corrosion and flame retardant mechanisms were also discussed in detail . This work provides a facial strategy for preparing versatile high performance epoxy thermoset with fire safety and corrosion resistance for various applications .
