 As a vascular scaffold it should have proper mechanical property to match autologous tissue and resist the blood pressure . The development of a biomimetic surface with biomolecules which is able to mimic the anticoagulation properties is fundamental and difficult in the research for blood vessel substitutes to overcome the formation of thrombi . In the present research heparin grafted polyurea gelatin nanofibrous tubular scaffold was prepared via electrospinning technique followed by heparin grafting . The fabricated PU75 E N Hep nanofibrous tubular scaffold showed higher hydrophilicity matched mechanical properties and improved blood compatibility . Furthermore cell viability cell morphology from cells culture in vitro and H E staining Masson s trichrome staining immunohistochemistry staining immunofluorescent staining were proceeded after implanted in rat s abdominal arterues for 1 week and 4 weeks demonstrating that scaffold contributed to facilitating the migration and growth of smooth muscle cells as well as inducing rapid adhesion of endothelial cells . Hence the PU75 E N Hep nanofibrous tubular scaffold is a promising candidate which can not only prevent acute thrombosis but also promote rapid regeneration of vascular tissue .

@highlight The scaffold could facilitate the migration and growth of smooth muscle cells and induce rapid adhesion of endothelial cells.
