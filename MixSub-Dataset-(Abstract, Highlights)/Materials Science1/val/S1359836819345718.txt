 We present electrical conductivity measurements and modeling aspects of carbon nanotube polymer composites enabled via fused filament fabrication additive manufacturing . CNT polylactic acid and CNT high density polyethylene filament feedstocks were synthesized through melt blending with controlled CNT loading to realize 3D printed polymer nanocomposites . Electrical conductivity of 3D printed CNT PLA and CNT HDPE composites was measured for various CNT loadings . Low percolation thresholds were obtained from measured data as 0.23 vol . and 0.18 vol . of CNTs for CNT PLA and CNT HDPE nanocomposites respectively . Moreover a micromechanics based two parameter agglomeration model was developed to predict the electrical conductivity of CNT polymer composites . We further show that the two agglomeration parameters can also be used to describe segregated structures wherein nanofillers are constrained to certain locations within the matrix . To the best of our knowledge this is the first ever electrical conductivity model to account for segregation of CNTs in the matrix . A good agreement between measured conductivity and predictions demonstrates the adequacy of the proposed model . We further evince the robustness of the model by accurately capturing the conductivity measurements reported in the literature for both elastomeric and thermoplastic nanocomposites . The findings of the study would provide guidelines for the design of electro conductive polymer nanocomposites .
