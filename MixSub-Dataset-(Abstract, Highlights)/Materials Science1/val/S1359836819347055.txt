 Transition metal phosphides have received extensive research attention as an electrode material for supercapacitors . Current application of TMPs as electrodes is restricted by their limited electrochemical reaction activity and electrical conductivity . Herein we report an effective strategy for fabricating highly porous oxygen doped NiCo phosphides immobilized in reduced graphene oxide network O

@highlight The samples with different electrochemical properties were obtained by controlling the doping of O in NiCoP by phosphorization.
@highlight Close connection between O NiCoP and rGO to increase conductivity and enhanced electron transport rate.
@highlight It is proved by Density functional theory DFT calculations that phosphating and introducing rGO can eliminate band gap and accumulate charge.
