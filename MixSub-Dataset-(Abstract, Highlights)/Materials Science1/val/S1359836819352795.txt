 Loading metal guests within porous aromatic frameworks via secondary functional groups is a promising route for introducing or enhancing PAF performance in various applications . Herein a quaternary pyridinium type porous aromatic frameworks and their composites are successfully synthesized and incorporated into the wood matrix to effectively realize fire prevention and anticorrosion . More remarkable PAF micro nano additives are well dispersed in wood matrix by self assembly strategy with in situ polymerization and settled the problem of compatibility . Results show that the treated wood had a strong self extinguishing ability and passed the UL 94 V 0 burning test . The char residue rate of the treated wood is significantly increased by 112.2 and the activation energy calculated according to the FWO method has been reduced by 26.3 due to its high pyrolysis and char forming reactivity . Meanwhile instead of combustible gases such as methane large amounts of CO

@highlight PAF 50 and Zn PAF 50 additives were successfully synthesized and incorporated into the wood matrix.
@highlight The treated wood had a strong self extinguishing ability and passed the UL 94 V 0 burning test.
@highlight The treated wood exhibited a good anticorrosion and dimension stability.
