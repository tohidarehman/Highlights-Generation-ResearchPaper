 The widespread overuse of antibiotics has led to the serious risks human life and environmental sustainability . Even though porous carbon composite derived from metal organic framework has been recognized as an efficient adsorbent for sequestering antibiotics owing to its unique properties the major drawback is the use of the expensive material such as terephthalic acid H
