 In order to solve the problems of poor mechanical properties and incapable reuse for single cellular foam this study proposed low cost spring like sandwich flexible foam composites with a 3D resilient concaveconvex structured fabric core and two gradient structured styrene ethylene butenestyrene copolymer g maleic anhydride filled polyurethane foam faces through two step foaming . RCFC plied with different sizes and distances constituted warp knitted spacer fabrics sealed between two layers of low melting polyester nonwovens through thermal bonding . The effects of SEBS g MAH content and volume content of RCFC cubes on compression and dynamic low velocity impact properties were explored at different impact energy levels . At 3 4 ratio of the upper to lower SEBS g MAH content faces and at 0.4 ratio of WKSF to PU volume ratio the resultant SFFCs showed a compression stress of 68.4kPa and absorbed up to 98 of impact energy under 16J . After five cycles of impact this sandwich foam composite maintained 98 absorption of impact energy demonstrating excellent spring like dynamic impact recovery property . Overall this study provided a novel structure design for lower cost higher performance recycling cushion materials in industrial construction transport packaging and sports fields .
