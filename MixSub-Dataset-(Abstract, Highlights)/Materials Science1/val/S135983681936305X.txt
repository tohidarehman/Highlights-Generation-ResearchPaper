 In the present study the early age reaction process of alkali activated slag pastes was in situ monitored by using embedded piezoelectric transducer based ultrasonic monitoring system . The effects of different types of activator on reaction process products and their microstructure evolution were investigated . The experimental results reveal that the early age reaction process of AAS can be effectively in situ observed by use of the ultrasonic method . It is found that the early age reaction process of AAS pastes made with sodium silicate can be divided into five stages dormant period acceleration period deceleration period second acceleration period and second deceleration period . However only three featured stages could be identified in those activated with sodium hydroxide . The soluble SiO
