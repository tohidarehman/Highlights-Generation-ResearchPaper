 Organic solvents are often used to prepare epoxy graphene nanocomposites . In this study a graphene precursor is developed which in epoxy at 200C is able to directly exfoliate into three classes of graphene platelets large single layer sheets medium sized sheets with 5.21.95nm in thickness and smaller 0.51.0nm thick sheets of 200500nm in lateral dimension with a Raman

@highlight A new graphene precursor is reported which can lead to single layer graphene.
@highlight Solvent free synthesis of epoxy nanocomposites is not only environmentally friendly but cost effective.
@highlight Graphene improves the electrical and thermal conductivity of epoxy.
