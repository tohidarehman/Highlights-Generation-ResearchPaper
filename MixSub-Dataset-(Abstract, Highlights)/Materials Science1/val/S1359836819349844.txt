 A sort of biodegradable magnesium based nanocomposites improved by nano sized NiTi particles has been offered in the current research with the evaluations for implant application . The samples were provided through mechanical alloying followed by sintering the assessments consisted of microstructure mechanical properties and in vitro biocompatibility . The impacts of integrating 15 30 and 45wt of NiTi nano particles on the characteristics of Mg3Zn 0.5Ag magnesium alloy matrix have been investigated . The addition of 15wt of NiTi led to a decline in the grain size by 10.5 an increase in the compressive strength by 56 and a rise in the elongation by 7.6 as compared to the matrix whereas further reinforcement addition reduced the elongation and compressive strength . The addition of 15wt NiTi causes a minor increase in corrosion rate but incorporating 30 and 45wt of NiTi content result a major increase in corrosion rate . The improved compressive mechanical properties may be ascribed to Hall Petch impact the load transfer from matrix to NiTi particles Orowan strengthening mechanism and locking of dislocations owing to the occurrence of hard NiTi reinforcement particles . In vitro biocompatibility tests such as MTT and DAPI assay revealed that the nanocomposites are appropriate for medical uses . It may be stated that the nanocomposite comprising 15wt of NiTi can be used appropriately as an orthopedic implant biomaterial .
