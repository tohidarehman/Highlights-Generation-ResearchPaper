 The poor impact toughness and flame retardant performance have greatly restricted the engineering application of epoxy thermoset . To obtain the high performance epoxy composites the renewable vanillin based flame retardant toughening agent was synthesized and incorporated into epoxy . The use of PVSi macromolecules can significantly enhance the impact toughness of epoxy . With 5wt of PVSi the impact strength of the epoxy was maximally raised by 189.69 from 12.42kJ m

@highlight A novel renewable polymeric flame retardant toughening agent PVSi was synthesized.
@highlight Multiple flame retardant elements are contained in PVSi.
@highlight PVSi obviously improves the fire safety of EP with ultra low phosphorus loading.
@highlight PVSi significantly improves the impact toughness of EP.
@highlight The mechanisms of flame retardancy.
