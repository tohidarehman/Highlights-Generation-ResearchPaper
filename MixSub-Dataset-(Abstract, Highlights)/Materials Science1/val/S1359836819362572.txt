 Due to low activity and poor wettability the fiber matrix interface is weak area which seriously affects the mechanical properties of fiber reinforced polymer composites . This paper focuses on the improvement of the interfacial adhesion of carbon fiber fabric reinforced polyphenylene sulfide composites . A two step combination strategy including liquid phase oxidation and grafting of silane coupling agents is developed to modify CF surfaces . The tensile strength flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength of CF PPS composites with modified CFs increased by 5.96 36.18 and 21.73 respectively . And the enhancement mechanism of the modification method established is revealed . Scanning electron microscope morphologies on fractured surfaces showed that predominant failure mechanisms changed from interface debonding to deformation and break of matrix . This indicates that this modification method is effective for promoting the interface bonding and enhancing the mechanical performances of CF PPS composites showing potential for industrialization .

@highlight Flexural strength and ILSS of CF PPS composites significantly improved after surface modification of CFs.
@highlight The mechanism of surface modification of CFs via liquid phase oxidation and introduction of SCAs was investigated.
@highlight This modification method provides a new idea for manufacturing FRP composites with superior mechanical properties.
