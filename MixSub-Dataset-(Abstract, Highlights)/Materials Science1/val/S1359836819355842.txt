 A ring of net structured TiBw TA15 composite is compressed near the transus temperature to investigate the microstructural evolution and determine the effect of the microstructure on properties after hot plastic deformation . The deformed net microstructure is predicted by performing numerical simulations and the results agree with the experimental data . The Lode s parameter is introduced to estimate the deformation states of net structured TiBw TA15 composite and it is dominated by the deformed morphology of the net microstructure . Then the quantitative relationships between morphological parameters of the net microstructure for the reinforcements and strain are established . The corresponding properties at different positions of the deformed ring are tested under room temperature compression . A
