 Flame retardant and smoke suppressant expanded polystyrene foams were prepared by coating a mixture of thermoplastic phenolic resin and aluminum hypophosphite or expandable graphene onto EPS spheres . The PF reacting with AP by hydrogen bond interaction formed a facile flame retardant coating PF AP which not only greatly reduced flammability and smoke release but also remained the thermal conductivities of EPS foams at low level . Compared with those of EPS PF EG EPS PF AP could pass the UL 94 test and showed better flame retardant performances with lower heat release rates and fire growth rates . Especially the time to ignition of EPS PF AP achieved 52s much higher than those of EPS PF EG and neat EPS . Also the peak of smoke production rate and the total smoke production of both composites were significantly reduced showing an excellent smoke suppressant performance . The mechanism analysis suggested that the PF AP coating could form a compact POC cross linked char layer and effectively protect the matrix from further combusting . Particularly the EPS PF AP had a higher compressive strength and lower thermal conductivity in comparison with EPS PF EG . These above results show that the EPS PF AP composite has enormous potential in building thermal insulation field .
