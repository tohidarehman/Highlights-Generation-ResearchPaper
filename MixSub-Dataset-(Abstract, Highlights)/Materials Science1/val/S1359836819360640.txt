 Multifunctional epoxy composites with low flammability high ablation resistance superior electrical conductivity and outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding performances are prepared by a two step procedure . The first step involves pyrolysis of lignin resorcinol glyoxal pre polymer into carbon foams while the second step is infiltrating flame retardant epoxy resins into the highly porous carbon foams . SEM images show that the three dimensional network microstructure of carbon foams is integrally preserved during infiltration by the epoxy resins which could serve as an effective pathway for electron transport . For the flame retardant carbon foam epoxy composite a UL 94 V 0 classification is achieved . In the cone calorimeter measurement the peak heat release rate and the total heat release of the FREP CF composite are reduced by 64 and 37 respectively compared to those of the original epoxy resin . The FREP CF composite can resist approximately 1000C flame for 10min with the temperature on the back side lower than 200C which is much better than the EP CF composite . Additionally a notable electrical conductivity of 216S m and a superior EMI shielding effectiveness of 33.5dB are achieved for the FREP CF composite . This multifunctional epoxy composite enables it a promising candidate for electronics aerospace and transportation applications .
