 Multilayer laminates comprising thirteen layers of Ti6Al4V alloy were produced by diffusion bonding . The influence of the processing conditions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of laminates were determined . The multilayer laminates were tested at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures under impact bending tests with recording of dynamic loading diagrams . The influence of the interfaces pores on the total energy of fracture the energy of crack initiation and the energy of crack propagation was analyzed . The impact strength value of the laminate decreased by 1.7 times for the crack divider orientation and it increased by 14 times for the crack arrester orientation with the relative length of pores increasing from 1 to 30 .

@highlight The synergetic effect of pores fraction and orientation of bonding interfaces was established.
@highlight For crack arrester orientation pores do not affect energy of crack nucleation but notably decrease the propagation energy.
@highlight The interfaces pores can positively influence the impact strength of the laminate.
@highlight The mechanism of improvement damage tolerance of Ti6Al4V multilayer laminate produced by diffusion bonding is revealed.
