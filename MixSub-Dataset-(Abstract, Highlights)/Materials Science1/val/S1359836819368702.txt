 Development of strong and tough biopolymer materials with favorable conductive properties is highly desirable and remains a great challenge in current scientific research . In this study a novel strategy is designed to prepare a conductive plant protein based films through the integration of functional graphene oxide into a hyperbranched network . The process was based on the Fe ion triggered simultaneous polymerization of dopamine and pyrrole . The incorporation of conductive GO nanosheets with the in situ formed polypyrrole nanoparticles could uniquely act as cross linking sites to make the nanocomposites highly conductive . As a result strong sacrificial metal ligand bonds and covalent bonds would be confined within the network . The toughness and strength of the nanocomposite film increased by 428.5 and 324.1 respectively . In addition this hybrid film showed significant improvement in electrical and thermal conductivities owing to the contribution of the highly conductive hyperbranched structures in the polymer matrix . Furthermore this renewable and biodegradable film had superior water resistance and ultraviolet barrier performance which are of great importance to the practical applications .
