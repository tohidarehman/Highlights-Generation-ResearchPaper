 The shielding mechanism for conversional electromagnetic shielding material is mainly dependent on the reflection thus the electromagnetic interference or pollution can t be really solved owing to the 2nd interference or pollution . To overcome this barrier we developed an absorption dominate EMI shielding material using low permittivity component TiO

@highlight Low dielectric component SiO
@highlight  C and TiO
@highlight  can be easily coated on carbonyl iron.
@highlight The as prepared shows dual magnetic and dielectric loss ability.
@highlight The impedance matching ability can be greatly improved.
@highlight The optimal sample has an excellent absorption dominate ability with a absorption coefficient of 43.3 .
@highlight The total shielding effectiveness was 29dB under a thickness of 1.5mm.
