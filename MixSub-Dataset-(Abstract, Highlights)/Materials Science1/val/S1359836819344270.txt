 Organically modified ammonium polyphosphate flame retardant is prepared by supramolecular assembly method using melamine formaldehyde resin and phytic acid as building blocks . Surface characteristics of APP are modified resulting in the enhancements in water resistance dispersion in the polymer matrix and their compatibility . This supramolecular assembly modified APP

@highlight The surface characteristics of APP were modified by supramolecular assembly.
@highlight Fire hazards of PP were greatly reduced by this modified APP and CFA.
@highlight Flame retardant mechanisms were proposed.
