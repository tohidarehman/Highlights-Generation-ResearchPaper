 A crosslinkable graphene oxide was synthesized and employed as reinforcement in waterborne polyurethane composite coatings for improving corrosion protection properties . Polycarbodiimide a crosslinking agent of WPU was chosen to modify GO . Three different conformations of functionalized graphene will be generated grape cluster conformation network conformation and tail conformation varying mainly with the PCD GO ratio . Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation were carried out to study the correlations between the PCD GO ratio the conformations of functionalized graphene as well as the dispersion state of graphene layers . The functionalized graphene with tail conformation was crosslinkable with WPU molecules along the interfaces . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the WPU coatings with 0.2wt crosslinkable graphene remained at a maximum impedance modulus of 10
