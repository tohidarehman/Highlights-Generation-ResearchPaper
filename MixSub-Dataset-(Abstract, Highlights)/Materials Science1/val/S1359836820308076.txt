 At present constructing composite materials with different absorbing mechanism is the popular strategy to realize the complementary and synergetic properties for electromagnetic wave absorbing materials . However the effective magnetic response is generally struggled to achieve . Besides the composition design strategy fully utilizing the interfacial polarization is another efficient method for the fabrication of microwave absorbing materials . In this work the titanium nitride nickel carbon ternary composites were fabricated through an in situ thermal nitridation process . The EM dissipation factors can be regulated by rational design of the ternary heterogeneous interface through varying the precursor composition . The minimum reflection loss of the optimized TiN Ni C nanocomposite can reach 35.1dBat 12.4GHz and the effective absorption bandwidth is 3.6GHz with a thickness of 1.7mm . The enhanced absorbing property is benefited from the effective structure design with tunable heterogeneous interface and continuous carbon matrix which would achieve promoted interfacial polarization conductivity relaxation and the electromagnetic impedance matching . Special structures of TiN Ni C ternary composites played a vital role in the effective electromagnetic absorption properties which is significant for designing efficient MA materials .
