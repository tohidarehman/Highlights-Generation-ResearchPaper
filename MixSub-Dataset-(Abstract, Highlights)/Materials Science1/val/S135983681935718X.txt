 In this paper a new proposed radar absorbing honeycomb sandwich composite with nickel coated glass fabric implemented via electroless plating was applied to the leading edge of a NACA 0012 wing airfoil model to reduce the echo radar cross section level . The composite was designed and fabricated without dispersing conductive nanoparticles or metal magnetic micropowders in polymer materials . The proposed composite exhibited 10dB microwave absorption in the frequency range of 5.816.3GHz with a resonance peak of 38.1dBat 8.2GHz under TM mode and an RCS reduction of 10dB for VV polarization and 8dB for HH polarization in the frequency range of 6.017.8GHz . When the proposed absorber was applied to the leading edge of NACA 0012 the simulated echo RCS level was reduced by 10dB from C band to Ku band under both horizontal and vertical polarizations . A flatwise compressive test was conducted to evaluate mechanical performance of the composite . The proposed composite can be potentially applied to the radar absorbing structure of stealth aircrafts .
