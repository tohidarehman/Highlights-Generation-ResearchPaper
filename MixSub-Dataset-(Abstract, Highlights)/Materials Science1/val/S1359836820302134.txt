 Owing to the outstanding mechanical performance diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A becomes an important thermoset resin but its brittleness and difficulties in degradation and recycling retard sustainable development . Herein we have prepared several hyperbranched epoxy resins containing 1 3 5 hexahydro s triazine HER HT

@highlight HER HTn showed versatility in modifying DGEBA.
@highlight HER HTn could improve distinctly the tensile flexural impact strengths of the DGEBA.
@highlight HER HTn could promote remarkably the degradation ability of the cured HER HT
@highlight  DGEBA composites.
@highlight The reinforcing and toughening mechanism and degradation mechanism of the composites were investigated.
