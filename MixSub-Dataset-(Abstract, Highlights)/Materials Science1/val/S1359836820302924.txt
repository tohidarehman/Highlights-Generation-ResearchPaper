 Electromagnetic wave absorption materials with strong absorption thin thickness broad bandwidth and low filler loading are highly desirable in the field of electromagnetic absorption . In this work graphene oxide was firstly used as a template for growth of cobalt zinczeolitic imidazolate frameworks and then nitrogen doped cobalt cobalt oxide carbon reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites were further constructed by the high temperature pyrolysis strategy . Results of morphology observations demonstrated that numerous carbon frameworks with a slightly contracted polyhedron morphology were anchored on the crumpled surfaces of sheet like RGO . Moreover well constructed structure of RGO loaded with carbon nanotubes wrapping carbon frameworks was observed and considerable nitrogen atoms had been in situ doped into the porous carbon matrix of attained nanocomposites . Furthermore the influences of filler loadings calcination temperature and addition of GO on the electromagnetic parameters and absorption performance of obtained nanocomposites were investigated . Results revealed that the addition of GO notably strengthened the electromagnetic absorption performance . Remarkably the percolation transition was observed in the filler loading range of 2025wt . The as synthesized nanocomposite under 700C calcination treatment exhibited superior electromagnetic absorption performance with an optimal reflection loss of 63.0dB and effective absorption bandwidth of 4.0GHz at a thin matching thickness of merely 1.6mm and filler loading as low as 25wt . In addition the underlying electromagnetic absorption mechanisms were proposed . This work provided a facile strategy for fabricating the carbon based magnetic composites derived from metalorganic frameworks as light weight and high performance electromagnetic absorption materials .
