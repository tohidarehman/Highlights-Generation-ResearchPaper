 The heat accumulation has become a serious problem due to electronic devices towards high power and intelligence . Highly thermal conductive and electrical insulating polymeric composites are potential to solving the overheating problem of electronic devices . Herein boron nitride nanosheets were successfully exfoliated by shear forces generated high pressure . Then BNNSs and sphere BN were added into the polydimethylsiloxane matrix to prepare composites . The thermal conductivity of the BNNSs PDMS composites achieved 1.16W m

@highlight BNNS filler was a good choice for improving highly thermal conductivity and electrical insulating of PDMS composites..
