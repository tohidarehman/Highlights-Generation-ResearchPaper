 In this study the free vibration and buckling responses of functionally graded nanoplates with magneto electro elastic coupling are studied for the first time using a nonlocal modified sinusoidal shear deformation plate theory including the thickness stretching effect . The constitutive relations for these kind of structures are defined . The equations of motion for rectangular sandwich plates in macro and nano scale are derived using a modified dynamic version of Hamilton s principle including a contribution of the electric and magnetic fields . The closed form analytical solution to simply supported plates is obtained using Navier solution technique . A power law distribution and a half cosine variation are used to model the variation of materials properties and electric magnetic potentials respectively . The analytical solutions are verified with well known solutions in the literature . A parametric study was conducted to show the effect of nonlocal parameter power law index predefined electric and magnetic fields axial compressive and tensile forces the aspect ratio of plates and volume ratio of functionally graded and piezomagnetic layers on mechanical behaviors of nanoplates . Obtained numerical results can be used as benchmark values for validation of correctness of diverse analytical and numerical methods applied for design and analysis of composite nanoelectromechanical systems .
