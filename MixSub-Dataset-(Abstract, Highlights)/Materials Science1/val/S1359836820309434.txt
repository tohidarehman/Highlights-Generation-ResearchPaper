 Polymer blend nanocomposites with the nanoparticles exclusively located at the interface have attracted significant attention while the compatibilization functions of such nanoparticles in the blends are still controversial . Herein the pristine boehmite nanorods and epoxide group modified boehmite nanorods have been synthesized and incorporated in the immiscible Poly

@highlight Ternary Poly 
@highlight  lactide Poly 1 4 butylene succinate boehmite nanorods nanocomposites were prepared.
@highlight Both pristine boehmite nanorods and epoxide groups modified boehmite nanorods are thermodynamically located at the interface of PLLA PBSU.
@highlight Barren nanorods deteriorate the mechanical properties of PLLA PBSU blends but surface grafted nanorods enhance the mechanical properties drastically.
@highlight Molecular entanglements of the grafted nanorods are the prerequisite for the compatibilization of immiscible polymer blends.
