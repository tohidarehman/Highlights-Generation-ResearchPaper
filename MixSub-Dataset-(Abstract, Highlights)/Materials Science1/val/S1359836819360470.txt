 Basalt fibers have attracted much attention in the composites industry because they are chemically stable and have excellent mechanical and thermal properties . Due to their high commercial value BFs have many applications in the polymer and construction industries . Although BF dosage is a key factor in basalt fiber reinforced composites and mechanical performance improves significantly as the dosage increases the fibermatrix interface is another important parameter that determines the performance of BFRCs during their service life . The adhesion between the matrix and the BF is crucial for transferring stress and enhancing the mechanical properties of the composite . This paper reviews polymer and cement composites reinforced with BF and discusses strategies for improving the fibermatrix interface such as surface modification of the fibers and the addition of micro and nanofillers to the matrix .
