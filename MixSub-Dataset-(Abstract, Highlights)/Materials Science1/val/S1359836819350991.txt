 Preparing flame retardant polyamide 6 composites with low addition of flame retardant remained one of the biggest concerns nowadays . In this work a novel aromatic Schiff base containing branched polysiloxane with high thermal stability and great capacity of charring was first synthesized as a self crosslinking flame retardant and then PA6 PCNSi composites were prepared through melt blending with different contents of PCNSi . Inspiringly a sharp reduction of about 48.9 in peak heat release rate was found for PA6 composite with only 6wt of PCNSi in contrast with PA6 and serious melt dipping behavior of PA6 was suppressed totally as 4wt of PCNSi was added into PA6 . The formation of a self extinguished layer was considered as the essential factor for reinforcing the flame retardancy of PA6 . This layer was generated under the synergistic effects of the cross linking reaction of Schiff base structure and thermo oxidative degradation of polysiloxane units in PCNSi . These composites also presented similar mechanical properties to PA6 due to the low addition of PCNSi and good interfacial interactions between PCNSi and PA6 .

@highlight An aromatic Schiff base containing branched polysiloxane PCNSi was prepared as a self crosslinking flame retardant.
@highlight A sharp reduction of 48.9 in peak heat release rate PHRR was achieved for PA6 when 6wt of PCNSi was added.
@highlight The serious melt dipping behavior of PA6 was suppressed totally only with 4wt of PCNSi.
@highlight PA6 PCNSi composites still retained the close mechanical properties to PA6.
