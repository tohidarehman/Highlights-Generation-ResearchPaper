 Hydrothermal is common process for synthesizing well ordered mesoporous silica however it costs time and energy simultaneously . To improve the efficiency of synthesis process it is necessary to propose a facile synthesis strategy with less time and energy requirement . In this study an innovative non hydrothermal method using NH

@highlight A non hydrothermal strategy is developed to extremely shorten the synthesis period of SSBA 15.
@highlight Effects of ripening time and NH
@highlight O concentration on the structure of the short pore SBA 15 are expounded.
@highlight SSBA 15 PEI 600 showed excellent regenerative stability during ten cycles.
@highlight The micro mesoporous structure facilitated dispersion of amine reagents and diffusion of CO
