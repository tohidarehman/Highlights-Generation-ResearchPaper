 Composite materials made of fiber reinforced plastics used in practice relevant components are subjected to varying static and cyclic loads during their service life . In general the loads acting on geometrically complex components generate inhomogeneous stress states which have different effects on damage initiation and propagation . This contribution focuses on the numerical modeling of the fatigue damage evolution under inhomogeneous stress states using a bending test as an example . Firstly a Finite Element based Fatigue Damage Model is extended for predicting the fatigue damage evolution under inhomogeneous stress states . To validate the numerical analysis a suitable bending device is developed to perform experimental tests . In order to generate a complex and inhomogeneous stress state the specimens are firmly clamped on both sides . Secondly experimental investigations and detailed FE simulations of the bending tests are performed at different global stress ratios . Based on the number of load cycles the deflection evolution of the bending specimens is obtained numerically as well as experimentally . Finally the comparison of simulation results with experiments demonstrates the predictive capability and applicability of the extended FDM as an engineering tool .
