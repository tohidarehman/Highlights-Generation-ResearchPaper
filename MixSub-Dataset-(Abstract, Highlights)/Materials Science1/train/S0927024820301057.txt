 By using the sacrificial layer etching GaAs substrates are separated from IIIV epi substrate Si substrate junctions that are made by surface activated bonding technologies . The post bonding low temperature 300

@highlight IIIV Si junctions with a
@highlight 90 of bonding yield is achieved in IIIV Si junctions prepared by direct wafer bonding and subsequent epitaxial lift off.
@highlight A post bonding annealing plays an essential role in realizing interfaces with an enough tolerance against HF based solution for sacrificial layer etching.
@highlight The epitaxial lift off process causes no influence on performances of MJ cells.
