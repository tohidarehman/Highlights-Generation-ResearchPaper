 Nitrate salts have been applied as heat transfer and heat storage medium in the Concentrating Solar Power plants . Corrosion is critical to the long time safe operation of the CSP system . This experimental study was conducted to research the dynamic corrosion behaviors of 316L stainless steel in high temperature quaternary nitrate nitrite mixture . The effects of corrosion on 316L stainless steel were investigated under the varied flow rates of 0.6m s 1.3m s and 2m s with 565C constant temperature for 1000h . The results showed that oxidation corrosion occurred in 316L stainless steel at all working conditions . The dynamic corrosion curves were parabolic and the value corrosion weight loss

@highlight Dynamic corrosion behavior of 316L steel are experimentally studied in quaternary nitrate nitrite mixed salt at 565C.
@highlight The corrosion rates of 316L steel are obtained at different flow velocities.
@highlight The analysis of dynamic corrosion mechanism is comparatively discussed by SEM XRD and EDS method.
