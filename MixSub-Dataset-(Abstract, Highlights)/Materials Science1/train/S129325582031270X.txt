 In this paper we studied the mechanochemical reactions between a series of metal carbonates and metal hydrides in the absence of a catalyst and found that the alkaline earth metal carbonate hydride systems show better methanation performances because these systems possess favorable thermodynamic properties . Among them the CaCO

@highlight The mechanical reactions of metal carbonates with metal hydrides was investigated.
