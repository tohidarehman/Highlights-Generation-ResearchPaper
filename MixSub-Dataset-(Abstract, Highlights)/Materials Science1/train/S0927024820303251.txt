 Sepiolite and exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets were applied as supporting material and thermal conductive fillers to solve the problems of possible leakage low thermal conductivity and high supercooling of

@highlight Erythritol Sep xGnP form stable phase change materials were prepared.
@highlight The supercooling of ME was suppressed from 80C to 30C in the form stable PCM.
@highlight The thermal conductivity of the form stable PCMs was doubled by 8wt xGnP.
@highlight The thermal stability of ME was increased in the form stable PCMs.
@highlight The
