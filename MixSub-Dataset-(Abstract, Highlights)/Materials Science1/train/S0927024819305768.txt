 This article describes the design of a silver electrodeposition based electrochromic device with excellent image retention properties by using the counter electrode reaction of Prussian blue . We demonstrated silver electrodeposition based EC device enabled various optical states without dyes and pigments . These optical states were explained by localized surface plasmon resonance absorption of silver nanoparticles electrodeposited on an indium tin oxide electrode . However the color retention property of the device was inadequate because of the presence of Cu

@highlight Novel silver electrodeposition based EC device was constructed.
@highlight Prussian blue works as the counter electrode reaction material.
@highlight The novel device has good image retention property and cycle stability.
