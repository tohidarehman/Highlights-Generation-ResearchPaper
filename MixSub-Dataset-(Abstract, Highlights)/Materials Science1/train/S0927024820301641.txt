 Passive daytime radiative cooling plays a significant role in various cooling operations which helps reducing electricity consumption and decreasing electricity demand . This work presents a new double layered radiative cooling structure composed of a transparent dipentaerythritol penta hexa acrylate top layer modified using Al

@highlight NPs is synthesized through simple and rapid photopolymerzation.
@highlight The film is envrionmental kindly without volatile organic compounds.
@highlight NPs acts like selectively emitter.
@highlight The structure with radiative cooling power 106.43 Wm
@highlight Small volume space cooling was achieved through
@highlight NPs Ag.
