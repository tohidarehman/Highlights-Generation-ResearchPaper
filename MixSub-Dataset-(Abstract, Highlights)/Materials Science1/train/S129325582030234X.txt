 PtCo alloy nanoparticles with different PtCo atomic ratios supported on a Ni bowl like pore arrays were controlled synthesized using a two step electro deposition strategy with the help of a monodispersed colloidal sphere template . Morphology characterization indicated that shaggy granular PtCo alloy was uniformly grown on the Ni ordered bowl like pore arrays . Electrochemical measurements in alkaline solution demonstrated that the PtCo Ni array with the atomic ratio of Pt Co 6 1 showed an optimal catalytic activity for methanol oxidation compared to the other PtCo Ni array the bowl like PtCo array and Pt Ni layered array . The present work provides new opportunities for the rational design of layered composite catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance for application in fuel cells .

@highlight PtCo Ni layered composite array was fabricated based on a sphere template and electrodeposition.
@highlight The product was a layer of shaggy granular PtCo alloy uniformly grown on the Ni ordered bowl like pore arrays.
@highlight PtCo Ni composite array exhibited high catalytic activity and stability toward the electrooxidation of methanol.
