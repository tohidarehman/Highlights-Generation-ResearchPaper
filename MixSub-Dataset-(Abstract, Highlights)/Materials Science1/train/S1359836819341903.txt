 This work reports our recent effort on the preparation of Phenyl N imine Nickel containing polyhydroxy groups and its application in improving the fire performance of PLA composites in combination with ammonium polyphosphate . The flame retardant evaluation revealed that the presence of 1.7 Ni MOF and 3.3 APP in PLA increased the LOI value to 31.0 upgraded the UL 94 level to V 0 decreased the peak heat release rate total heat release and total smoking production by 27 19 and 50 respectively and substantially delayed the time to ignition from 67 to 97s . It was proposed that the flame retardants take effect in both vapor and condensed phases and Ni MOF nanosheets can synergistically improve the flame resistance of PLA with APP . The incorporation of Ni MOF effectively inhibited the deterioration of mechanical properties for PLA composites caused by the presence of APP .

@highlight The Ni MOF nanosheets containing polyhydroxy groups was prepared.
