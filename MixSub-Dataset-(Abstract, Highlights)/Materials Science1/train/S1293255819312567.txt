 A series of Na ZSM 5 zeolite supported Pd catalysts with different Si Al ratios were synthesized . And the effect of different Si Al ratios on the catalytic combustion of VAM was investigated . The Pd Na ZSM 5 40 shows the best catalytic activity for VAM as to catalytic test . Through various techniques XRD SEM HRTEM XPS H

@highlight The effect of Si Al ratios with Pd Na ZSM 5 catalysts on the low concentration methane catalytic combustion was studied.
@highlight As obtained Na ZSM 5 40 possesses a stepped cylindrical morphology which is benefit for the dispersion of Pd particles.
@highlight Compare with the other two catalysts the Pd Na ZSM 5 40 catalyst has the highest PdO and O
