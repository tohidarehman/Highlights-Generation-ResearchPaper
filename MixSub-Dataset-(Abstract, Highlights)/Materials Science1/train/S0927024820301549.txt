 Recent developments have renewed the demand for solar cells with increased tolerance to radiation damage . To investigate the specific irradiation damage of 1MeV electron irradiation in GaInAsP lattice matched to InP for varying In and P contents a simulation based analysis is employed by fitting the quantum efficiency and open circuit voltage simultaneously before and after irradiation the induced changes in lifetime are detected . Furthermore the reduction of irradiation damage during regeneration under typical satellite operating conditions for GEO missions is investigated . A clear decrease of the radiation damage is observed after post irradiation regeneration . This regeneration effect is stronger for increasing InP fraction . It is demonstrated that the irradiation induced defect recombination coefficient for irradiation with 1MeV electrons after regeneration for 216h can be described with a linear function of InP fraction between 110
