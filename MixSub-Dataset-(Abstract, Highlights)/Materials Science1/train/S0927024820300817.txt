 In this work modified BET model was applied to obtain phase diagrams and to design new eutectic mixtures . As a result the eutectic composition and the melting point of two mixtures based on salt hydrates LiNO

@highlight Two new eutectic mixtures based on Li Mn Na nitrate salt hydrates are obtained.
@highlight BET model predicts phase diagram eutectic composition and melting point.
@highlight Experimental verifications with T history and DSC showed good accordance.
@highlight Thermal and physical properties were evaluated.
@highlight New PCMs have potential for use in the solar assisted air conditioning system.
