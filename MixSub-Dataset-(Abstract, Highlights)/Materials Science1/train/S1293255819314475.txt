 This manuscript presents a simple efficient and environmentally benign room temperature aerobic catalytic process to the selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides by Dy substituted 5 oxopyrrolidine 2 carboxylic acid immobilized on SBA 15 . The catalyst could be reused seven cycles without any loss in performance . This is the first selective aerobic oxidation of sulfides using a Dy based heterogeneous system .

@highlight 5 oxopyrrolidine 2 carboxylic acid Glp dysprosium complex was anchored on SBA 15.
@highlight The SBA 15 Glp Dy was used as catalyst for selective aerobic oxidation of sulfides.
@highlight This catalyst could be reused seven cycles without significant loss in activity.
