 Remediation of the dye contaminated water has received a broad interest due to the health problems and defects in the ecological system originating from the presence of such toxic materials in water . Herein

@highlight Heat treatment of manganese malonate at 350 C under Ar and H
@highlight atmospheres results in formation of
@highlight nanocomposites.
@highlight The nanocomposites possess both microporous and mesoporous pores
@highlight The largest surface area was adopted by the nanocomposite obtained under H
@highlight The nanocomposite obtained under H
@highlight showed the highest removal efficiency for MB via adsorption process.
@highlight Also it showed efficient photocatalytic performance for the removal of eosin Y while exposing to sunlight.
