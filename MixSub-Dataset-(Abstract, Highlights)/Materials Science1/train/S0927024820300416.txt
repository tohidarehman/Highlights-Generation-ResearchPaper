 High quality perovskite films with uniform coverage and large grains are indispensable to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells with high efficiency and stability . However solution processed perovskite films usually possess small grains associated with abundant grain boundaries which induce high trap state density and then seriously degrade the device performance . In this paper the volatile Lewis base thioacetamide is employed as an additive to fabricate high quality methylammonium lead iodide MAPbI
