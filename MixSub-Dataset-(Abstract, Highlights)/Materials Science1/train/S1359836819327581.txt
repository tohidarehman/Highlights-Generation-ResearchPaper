 In this study we demonstrate enhanced mechanical properties of three dimensional graphene hydroxyapatite nanocomposites by employing the Taguchi method . The hydrothermal process time the total pressure the hydrothermal temperature and the weight percent of graphene to the hydroxyapatite were considered as control parameters . The results showed that all parameters were effective in controlling the process . According to the findings the hydrothermal temperature had the greatest effect on the results . The predicted strength fracture toughness was 2.080.03 MPa.m
