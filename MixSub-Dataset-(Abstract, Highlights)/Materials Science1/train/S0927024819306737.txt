 Solar steam generation is a kind of highly promising technology for harvesting solar energy and the production of fresh water . Here we report the fabrication of a novel Ca

@highlight Ca
@highlight crosslinked sodium alginate modified monolithic PPy sponge.
@highlight The PPy sponge exhibits micron sized channels low thermal conductivity 99 light absorption.
@highlight It shows high solar evaporation efficiency excellent salt resistant performance and recyclability.
