 We investigate the effect of graphene localization on the morphology and properties of Polyamide 6 Polyolefin elastomer blends . Two systems with different compositions were studied 60 40 and 80 20 . In this study we demonstrate that the migration behavior of graphene is strongly dependent on its dispersion state which is determined by mixing order . We show that the neat 60 40 blend has an unstable co continuous morphology which breaks up over time during annealing to a droplet matrix morphology with POE being the continuous phase . The addition of 3wt graphene leads to co continuous morphologies independent of mixing order . In the case of 80 20 systems preparation of nanocomposites with a POE master batch resulted in elongated POE dispersed domains which becomes a co continuous morphology at higher level of graphene content . However we observed a decrease in the continuity of the POE phase in the nanocomposite containing 3 wt of graphene due to a reduction of coalescence . Our rheological and electrical measurements revealed that the graphene formed a stronger percolated structure in 80 20 blend containing 3wt of graphene in comparison to 60 40 3 nanocomposites which resulted in lower electrical resistivity . The electrical percolation threshold in this system is 0.66wt which demonstrates that using graphene to induce co continuity in a highly asymmetric composition is a promising approach to design electrically conductive blends with a very low percolation threshold .

@highlight The location of graphene in the blend depends on its dispersion state which is determined by mixing order.
@highlight The addition of graphene results in a stable co continuous morphology for composition near to phase inversion.
@highlight Graphene induces co continuous morphology in asymmetric composition blends when it is localized in the minor phase.
@highlight The lower the minor phase content the higher the electrical conductivity.
