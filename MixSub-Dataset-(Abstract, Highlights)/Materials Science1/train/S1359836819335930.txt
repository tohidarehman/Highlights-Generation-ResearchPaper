 New biodegradable trays based on cassava starch blended with sugarcane bagasse as the main component and cornhusk malt bagasse or orange bagasse have been investigated . Gelatinized cassava starch solution was used as binder . The resulting trays displayed thickness between 3.5050.18 and 3.9640.52mm and density between 0.1990.01 and 0.2130.02g cm

@highlight Trays containing sugarcane and malt or orange bagasse or cornhusk were prepared.
@highlight All the biodegradable trays were more rigid than traditional EPS trays.
@highlight Addition of 20 and 30 MB or OB produced less mechanically resistant trays.
@highlight Trays stored under medium and high relative humidity had high water sorption.
@highlight After analysis for 60 days trays with 20 or 30 OB were completely degraded.
