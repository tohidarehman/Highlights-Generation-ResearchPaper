 Copper oxide is an exciting semiconducting material with interesting structural and optical properties . Transition metal doped CuO nanostructures have great potential to use in memory device applications . In the present work we describe in detail the synthesis of pure CuO cobalt and manganese doped CuO via low temperature co precipitation method . Various techniques like X ray diffraction Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy Raman spectroscopy X ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device magnetometer have been utilized to characterize the synthesized nanoparticles . XRD data exhibits a pure monoclinic phase of CuO for all synthesized samples . Surface morphology obtained from FE SEM clearly shows the presence of cluster like structure of grains . The magnetic investigations suggest that pure CuO nanoparticles exhibit the superparamagnetic state which further transforms to antiferromagnetic state with Co doping . However a peak of sharp intensity at T T
