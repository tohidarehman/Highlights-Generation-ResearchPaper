 We studied the effect of seed layer deposition time on the growth of ZnO nanorods by using potentiostatic electrolysis . Microstructural optical and photoelectrochemical responses of ZnO nanorods were determined from XRD FE SEM UVVis spectroscopy and MottSchottky measurements . Changes in seed layer time crystallinity diameter and density of ZnO nanorods were examined . The results show that the sample deposited with the seed layer time of 60s has a good crystallinity and preferred orientation along the plane and high nanorod density with smaller diameter size . The sample showed an enhanced photoelectrochemical response with low carrier density compared to other ZnO samples . The optical measurements showed high transmittance and direct band gap of around 3.24eV . The nanostructured ZnO deposited in this work is a promising candidate for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications .

@highlight Well oriented ZnO nanorods were electrodeposited using two steps process.
@highlight Density of ZnO Nanorods varies with ZnO seed layer deposition time.
@highlight The films deposited with 60 s in time of nucleation shows a good physical properties.
@highlight The nucleation step noticeably influences the Nanorods properties.
