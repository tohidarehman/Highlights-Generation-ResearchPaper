 The production of fresh water by means of solar steam generation has emerged as one of frontier technologies for addressing the global water shortage issue . Here we report the preparation of new photothermal materials by chemical modification of nickel foam with sulfur via a simple hydrothermal method for solar steam generation . The generation of nano nickel wire on the surface of skeleton of nickel foam by sulfur treatment could construct a much more dense network with hierarchical porous structure and hydrophilicity which significantly enhance their light absorption as well as water transportation . In the way the as prepared SNi foam possesses a high energy conversion efficiency of 83.6 under 1kWm

@highlight S Ni foam has high light absorption good thermal stability and an open pore structure.
@highlight OR S Ni foam is chemically modified with PDDA PFO giving it unique oil repellent properties.
@highlight OR S Ni foam possesses a high evaporation efficiency of 79.1 under 1 sun irradiation.
