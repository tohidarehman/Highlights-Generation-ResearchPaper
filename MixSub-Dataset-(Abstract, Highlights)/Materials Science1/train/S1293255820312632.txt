 The reactivity and electronic sensitivity of pristine B doped graphyne and Si doped graphyne sheet toward the methanol gas adsorption were explored by calculation of density functional theory . It was discovered that the pristine graphyne unstably adsorbs the methanol gas with a 6.28kcalmol

@highlight The effect of doping on the sensitivity of graphyne to CH
@highlight OH gas is studied.
@highlight The sensitivity is significantly improved by doping.
@highlight B and Si doped graphyne can be used as nanosensor to detect CH
@highlight OH gas.
