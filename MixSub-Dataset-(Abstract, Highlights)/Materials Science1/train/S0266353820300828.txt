 Carbon fiber reinforced bismaleimide resin composites were recycled by chemical methods . The degradation of bismaleimide resin was achieved in subcritical acetic acid . The C N bonds of BMI resin were selectively cleaved by Ca NO

@highlight BMI was successfully decomposed via selective cleavage of C N bonds and CF was successfully recovered.
@highlight N doped carbon materials were prepared from degradation products of BMI.
@highlight The N doped carbon materials were used as catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to DFF.
