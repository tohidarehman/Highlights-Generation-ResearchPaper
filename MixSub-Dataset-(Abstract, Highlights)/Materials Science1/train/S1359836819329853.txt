 Advances in bio based composite materials offer potential opportunities for economic revalorization of agroindustrial residues such as starchy tubers peels and bagasse . In this work cassava and ahipa peels and bagasse are studied as potential fillers of thermoplastic corn starch films . It was assessed the effect of studied organic fillers on thermal stability as well as optical water vapor barrier and mechanical properties of TPS . In all cases type and content of the filler had a great impact on the biocomposites properties . Results demonstrated that these fillers modify TPS properties and gives utility to these residues with low economic cost .

@highlight Cassava and ahipa starch extraction by products were used as biomaterials fillers.
@highlight . Thermomechanical properties were significantly affected by residue type.
@highlight Mechanical behavior of thermoplastic corn starch was improved by filler addition.
@highlight Filler type and content had a great impact on composites color and optical barrier.
