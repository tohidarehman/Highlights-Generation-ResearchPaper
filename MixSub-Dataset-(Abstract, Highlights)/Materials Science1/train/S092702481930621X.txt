 Plasmonic nanofluids are recently explored to promote steam generation showing great promise of such fluids for solar thermal applications . However plasmonic nanoparticles are opaque and the nanofluids require high mass concentration to achieve efficient evaporation which in turn leads to parasitic light absorption for the underlying particles . In this work we introduce bubbles into dilute plasmonic nanofluids to enhance solar water evaporation . The dynamic bubbles not only act as light scattering centers to extend the incident light pathway and amplify solar flux but also provide large gas liquid interfaces for moisture capture as well as kinetic energy from bubble bursting to improve vapor diffusion . The coupling effect between plasmonic heating and bubbly flow humidification results in a steam generation rate of 0.72kgm
