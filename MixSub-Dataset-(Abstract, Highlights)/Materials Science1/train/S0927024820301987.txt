 By integrating CdSeTe alloy into CdTe based thin film solar cells high efficiency above 19 has been obtained . However the role of O

@highlight We found the oxygen performed an important role in CdSeTe deposition process by close space sublimation CSS .
@highlight The effects of O
@highlight on the CdSeTe deposition material performance and devices have been studied.
@highlight Oxygen in the ambient can increase Se content in the CdSeTe alloy for the as deposited films.
@highlight With the oxygen appearance the composition of as deposited CdSeTe films and the source can be controlled relative stable.
@highlight The short circuit current density 
@highlight  and fill factor 
@highlight  of the cells are promoted with the introduce of oxygen.
