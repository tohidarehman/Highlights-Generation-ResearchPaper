 To offset the negative impact of photovoltaic modules on the environment it is necessary to introduce a long term strategy that includes a complete lifecycle assessment of all system components from the production phase through installation and operation to disposal . Recycling of waste products and worn out systems is an important element of this strategy .

@highlight LCA comparison for PV cells production with recovered and nonrecovered silicon was conducted.
@highlight Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the use of recycled silicon material represents 42 .
@highlight The total impact of PV production can be reduced by as much as 58 primarily due to reduced energy consumption.
