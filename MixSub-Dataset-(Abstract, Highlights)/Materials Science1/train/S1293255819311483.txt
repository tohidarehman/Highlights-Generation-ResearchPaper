 A facile eco friendly approach is proposed for fast preparation of a partially reduced graphene oxide carbon nanotube iron silver hybrid under ambient conditions . The partial reduction and exfoliation of GO the ultrafast growth of CNT on the rGO surface and the formation of AgNPs occurred simultaneously within 1030s using a domestic microwave oven . The morphology and structure of the rGO CNT Fe Ag hybrid are discussed in detail and a possible formation mechanism is proposed . The obtained rGO CNT Fe Ag hybrid exhibited high catalytic activity for reduction of 4nitrophenol by NaBH
