 This study firstly proposed the fabrication and characterization of novel multifunctional aluminum nickel perfluorosilane composites with stable thermal energy release capability and anti wetting properties via a controllable electrophoretic assembly deposition method through co assembly of aluminum and nickel nanoparticles and further surface functionalization with natural drying . Products exhibited promising reticulate like microstructures with uniform distribution and high degree of crystallinity . The controllable fabrication of composites can be realized conveniently by deeply analyzing the assembly dynamics of EAD process of different nanoparticles in an optimal suspension
