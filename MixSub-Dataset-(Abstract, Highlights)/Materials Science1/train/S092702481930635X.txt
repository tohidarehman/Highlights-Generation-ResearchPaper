 For boosting the power conversion efficiency of quantum dot sensitized solar cells metal oxide has been prepared via a facile mean and applied for CE materials in CdS CdSe ZnS QDSSCs . The electrochemical properties of the CoO counter electrode and photovoltaic performances of QDSSCs are investigated in detail . Under analogous sunlight illumination compared with traditional Cu

@highlight CoO metal oxide nanorod has been employed as a counter electrode to improve efficiency of QDSSC.
@highlight The CoO nanorods counter electrode CE showed better electrocatalytic activity compared with traditional Cu
@highlight S CE.
@highlight The PCE of QDSSCs applied with CoO counter electrode was increased to 6.02 .
