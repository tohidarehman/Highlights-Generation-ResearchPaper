 Molten salt is considered to be a significant medium of thermal energy storage used for concentrating solar power . Reasonably improving its thermophysical properties can realize the efficient utilization of solar energy . To investigate the effect of nanoparticle doped molten salt adding two size nano alumina with different content to solar salt by high temperature melting method . The using temperature zone had been broadened . For the same system the specific heat c
