 Though perovskite solar cells have reached high efficiency comparable to its counterparts it is still striving towards finding a strong hold in terms of long term stability . Several approaches have been made to prevent the degradation of PSC . Here we present low temperature ALD deposited Al

@highlight encapsulated PSC retained 84 of initial efficiency by the end of 300 days of intermittent measurement in ambient.
@highlight QCM showed non linearity in mass change until a complete surface coverage after which it reaches the linear growth regime.
@highlight FTIR revealed continuous addition of AlCH
