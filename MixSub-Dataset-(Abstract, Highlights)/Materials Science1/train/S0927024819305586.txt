 Two dimensional transition metal carbides carbonitrides have demonstrated wide application prospect in energy conversion and storage mostly in the form of electrochemical energy storage . Compared with the conversion between chemical energy and electrical energy an energy conversion process initiated by solar energy and driven by the physical change of energy materials will be a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy . Therefore a high performance MXene aerogel based phase change material for solar energy conversion and thermal energy storage is constructed . MXene nanosheets with an extinction coefficient of 25.67L at 808nm demonstrate excellent light absorption performance which can spontaneously convert the solar energy into thermal energy . The polyethylene glycol possessing high affinity with MXene acts the medium for thermal energy storage and release in the process of fusion and solidification . The
