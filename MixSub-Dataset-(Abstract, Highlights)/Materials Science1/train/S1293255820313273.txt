 Indoor plant growth can protect crops from damage caused by climate variations in outdoor lighting systems . For indoor plant cultivation artificial light sources are needed to enhance the plant growth . Regarding this problem a series of SrZr

@highlight Dy doped SrZr
@highlight  PO
@highlight nanophosphors were prepared using the sol gel method.
@highlight Rietveld refinement of XRD was carried out.
@highlight Surface states of the phosphors were studied by XPS.
@highlight The phosphor has shown CIE values 0.30 0.29 and CRI 77.
