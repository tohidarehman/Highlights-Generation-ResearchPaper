 Saharan silver ants can inhabit one of the hottest areas the Sahara Desert which benefits from their thermoregulatory functionality thanks to a sophisticated photonic structure of hairs . Mimicking the photonic structure we fabricated the flexible hair like photonic structures on polydimethylsiloxane . Attaching them to glass bottles for a proof of concept demonstration the considerably enhanced optical reflection was observed as well as the slightly improved mid infrared emission . These extraordinary properties enabled the temperature of the glass bottles to be reduced by around 5.6C in the hot daytime and keep relatively warm in the cold nighttime . On the basis of optical and thermal properties of the silver ants inspired photonic structures potential applications could be further found in wearable devices and personal thermal management .

@highlight We mimicked the Saharan silver ants hair and fabricated the biomimetic structures.
@highlight The biomimetic structures exhibited the improved optical reflection and heat dissipation as silver ants.
@highlight The temperatures of glass bottles covered by the biomimetic structures were reduced by 5.6C in the hot daytime.
@highlight The glass bottles did not exhibit the considerable heat loss in the cold nighttime.
@highlight The flexible biomimetic structures could be applied in wearable devices and personal thermal management.
