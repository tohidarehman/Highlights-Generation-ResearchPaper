 Inorganic organic nanocomposites composed of nanoparticles and polymers offer a vast space for tuning material properties have attracted considerable interest . In this work a nanocomposite composed of Cs

@highlight A Cs
@highlight WO
@highlight  PMMA nanocomposite with high transmittance and low haze was fabricated by an in situ polymerization process.
@highlight The nanocomposite exhibited excellent NIR absorbing performance.
@highlight The heat shielding ability of the nanocomposite is superior to ITO glass.
