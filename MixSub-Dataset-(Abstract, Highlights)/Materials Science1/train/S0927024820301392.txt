 In concentrating solar power technologies the absorber material should be spectrally selective under severe operating conditions i.e . 1000C under air atmosphere . SiCTiC nanocomposites could be good candidates for this application due to their spectral selectivity at room temperature however their behaviour under CSP operating conditions is unknown . Therefore the spectral selectivity and oxidation resistance of TiCSiC composites were studied up to 500C in air and at various compositions . During heating the emittance increased with the temperature . After heating the TiC grains at the surface were oxidized to TiO

@highlight SiCTiC nanocomposite materials have good optical properties spectral selectivity .
@highlight SiC improves the oxidation resistance of the TiCSiC nanocomposite.
@highlight TiC oxidation is limited by the formation of a protective silica layer.
