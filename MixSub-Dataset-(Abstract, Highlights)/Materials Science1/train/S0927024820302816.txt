 Reflection is the most disconcerting phenomenon for solar cover glass and Omnidirectional Broadband Antireflective coating enhances the transmission of the solar cover glass and power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cell . In this connection a facile synthesis route is adapted to develop hollow MgF

@highlight Successfully developed MgF
@highlight hollow nanoparticles from Magnesium carbonate precursor.
@highlight OBAR Films demonstrated excellent angle invariant antireflection property.
@highlight Transmittance enhancement of 540 over an angle of incidence ranging from 10 to 80.
@highlight MgF
@highlight hollow nanoparticles were thoroughly investigated by Small angle X ray scattering SAXS .
@highlight  10 net increment in the efficiency was observed for OBAR coated glass encapsulated device.
