 Many studies performed on multifunctional properties of epoxy based nanocomposites reinforced with carbon nanotubes and nanoclay whereas their synergetic effects on piezoresistive behaviour of ternary state nanocomposites still remains unaddressed . Therefore the hybrid effects of double walled CNTs and NC on the mechanical electrical and piezoresistive performances of the epoxy were addressed in this study . Nanocomposites were prepared in two different states i.e . the binary state and the ternary states . SEM FESEM and XRD were used for the microstructural analysis of the materials while tensile and mode I fracture tests were performed for mechanical and piezoresistive characterizations . The addition of NC to CNTs doped epoxy resulted in a better CNT dispersion hindering CNT re agglomeration . A significant increase in K

@highlight The first study on piezoresistivity performance of hybrid CNTs and nanoclay doped epoxy.
@highlight Developing a novel method using secondary nanofiller in order to thoroughly improve CNTs dispersion.
@highlight Ternary nanocomposite showed better mechanical electrical and electromechanical properties compared to the binary one.
