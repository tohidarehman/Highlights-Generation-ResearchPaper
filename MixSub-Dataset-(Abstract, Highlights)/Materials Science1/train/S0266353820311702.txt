 Hexagonal boron nitride as a high thermal conductive filler has been widely used to construct thermal transport network in polymers . However anisotropic thermal property of BN and its conventional thermal conductive network usually lead to high thermal conductivity in one direction that limits the overall heat dissipation effect . Herein we report a novel radially aligned three dimensional boron nitride nanosheets epoxy composite for thermal interface materials

@highlight Polymer BN composites prepared
@highlight freeze casting method commonly show anisotropic thermal conductive properties.
@highlight Thermal interface materials present high thermal conductivities at low BN ratio.
@highlight Bidirectional high thermal conductive composites are obtained from radial freeze casting method.
@highlight Bidirectional orientation of BN increases thermal conductivity.
@highlight Radially aligned lamellae structure provides bidirectional phonon transport pathways.
