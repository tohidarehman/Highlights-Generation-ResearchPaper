 Harvesting full spectrum sunlight for direct absorption solar collectors has attracted extensive attention and a number of potential nanofluids have been reported . In the current work oxygen deficient TiO

@highlight Oxygen deficient TiO
@highlight  TiO
@highlight  with full solar spectrum absorption are prepared.
@highlight Highly dispersed and stable oil based nanofluids are achieved.
@highlight DASCs with medium temperatures are established.
@highlight Au TiO
@highlight could improve solar thermal conversion by combining the advantages of Au and TiO
