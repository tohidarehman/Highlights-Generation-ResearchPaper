 Decreasing the thickness of perovskite absorption layer is significant for obtaining semi transparent tandem and flexible photovoltaic devices with high performance . However the light harvesting would be influenced due to the limited absorption . Introducing plasmonic metal nanoparticles into perovskite solar cells is regarded as a promising approach on the development of ultra thin PSCs . In this work gold nanostars with strong local electromagnetic field and SnO
