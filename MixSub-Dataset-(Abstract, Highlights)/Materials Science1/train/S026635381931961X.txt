 This paper deals with the evaluation of several homogenization methods for short fiber reinforced composites in isothermal linear elasticity . In order to have an unbiased assessment only full field finite element versions of the methods are developed and studied no analytical mean field models are considered . Firstly the FE homogenization of unidirectional SFRC is performed using two computational models representative volume elements and unit cells and comparing their predictions . Secondly for the homogenization of misaligned SFRC a model RVE seen as an aggregate of UD pseudo grains is homogenized in two steps . In the first step the effective response of PGs is obtained by FE analysis on UD unit cells . The second step is performed with one of three homogenization schemes Voigt Reuss and a FE based version of the Mori Tanaka model . The latter is equivalent to a direct MT homogenization of the RVE . The actual SFRC microstructure is 3D but because of limited computer resources the current article is restricted to 2D analyses which nevertheless provide some guidance . A parametric study is conducted using several fiber volume fractions and orientation tensor components . Both the effective properties of RVEs and the mean strains inside individual fibers are assessed against reference results obtained by direct FE homogenization of the actual RVEs .
