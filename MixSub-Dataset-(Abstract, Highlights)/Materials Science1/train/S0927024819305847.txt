 Understanding the relationship of doping density carrier lifetime and interface recombination to device performance is critical to designing solar cells with high power conversion efficiency . In turn it is necessary to understand how bulk material composition determines doping density and carrier lifetime . The most efficient kesterite Cu

@highlight Cu poor Zn rich compositions yielded longest carrier lifetimes highest PCEs.
@highlight Monocrystals enable fundamental studies to complement polycrystalline films.
@highlight Combination of experiments and simulations indicates pathway to higher PCEs.
