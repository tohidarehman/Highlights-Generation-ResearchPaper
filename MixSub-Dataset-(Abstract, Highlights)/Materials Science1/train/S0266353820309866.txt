 Three dimensional boron nitride scaffolds were fabricated by the ice templating method and polycaprolactone 3D BN composites were prepared by vacuum impregnation of caprolactone monomers into 3D BN scaffolds and then polymerization via the microwave assisted technique . The results reveal that hexagonal boron nitrides in the PCL 3D BN composites present three orientation patterns that is parallel and vertical alignment in the direction of ice crystal and random orientation . Moreover the orientation of hBNs plays an essential role in improving the thermal conductivity of the composite . The maximum thermal conductivities of the PCL 3D BN composite are 1.42 and 1.01Wm
