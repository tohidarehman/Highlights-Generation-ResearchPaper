 Soft actuators are now required to be smarter to perceive the outside world besides mechanical deformation which has broader applications in soft robotics wearable devices and biomedical electronics . However most of the sensory actuators in previous research were complicated because of the separation of sensing and actuating units . Here a shape memory soft actuator integrated with reversible electric moisture actuating and strain sensing was prepared with a compact sandwich structure . Silver nanoparticles were used to form a middle composite layer connecting a hygroscopically deformable polyvinyl alcohol layer with a high performance flexible shape memory polymer layer . With the electrothermal AgNP layer the PVA AgNPs FSMP composite shows quick recovery under ultralow voltage high strain sensing sensitivity and fast response to deformation . What is more the compact construction endows the PAF composite with electrical stability in 1000 bending cycles . Due to the novel combination of PVA FSMP and AgNPs the low power PAF actuator can efficiently load and unload target objects without additional cooling process and distinguish the presence and weights of them in real time . The results suggest that the soft PAF actuator has great potential applications in soft robotics and biomimetic devices especially in automated packaging production lines of food medicine logistics sorting and other industries .

@highlight A tri layer soft actuator consists of a hygroscopic layer a silver nanoparticle layer and a flexible shape memory layer.
@highlight The shape memory composite integrates reversible electric moisture actuating with sensitive strain sensing.
@highlight The reversible actuating is attributed to combination of electro active shape memory effect and swelling deformation.
@highlight Silver nanoparticles form the conductive middle layer that generates joule heat and provides the sensing property.
