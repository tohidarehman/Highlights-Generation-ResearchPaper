 Polyimide is an essential substrate or packaging material for various electronic devices . The decreased packaging size and high integration in electronic systems have caused the issue of heat accumulation issue . However the intrinsic low thermal conductivity of PI can not meet the requirements of certain electronic systems . Herein we report a facile and effective approach to fabricating highly thermally conductive polyimide based composites by constructing 3D nanofiller segregated networks in the matrix and realizing reduced interfacial thermal resistance between adjacent nanofillers . First a water soluble poly tertiary amine salt was utilized as a surfactant to facilitate the dispersion of hydrophobic boron nitride nanosheets in aqueous phase . Then a combination of the ice templating strategy and a hot pressing treatment was applied to control the oriented distribution of BNNS and the silver nanowires were incorporated and acted as thermally conductive bridges resulting in an obvious decrease of thermal interfacial resistance and forming an interconnected thermally conductive expressway . Thus a significant improvement in the thermal conductivity was achieved . The resultant nanocomposite with 20wt BNNS AgNW exhibited an in plane thermal conductivity of 4.75Wm
