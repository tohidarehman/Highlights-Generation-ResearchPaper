 Hydrogels have emerged as fascinating material for various applications in the chemical biomedical and energy fields . Generally their poor self healing performance mechanical properties and bioactivity limit the application of hydrogels in bioelectronics . Herein a self healable injectable stretchable self adhesive biocompatible and conductive poly

@highlight A PVA GA composite hydrogel was prepared via hydrogen bonding between the tertiary amide groups and hydroxyl groups.
@highlight The composite hydrogel possesses self healable stretchable self adhesive biocompatible and conductive properties.
@highlight The hydrogel can detect the physiological activity signals precisely for the application in wearable electronic sensors.
