 In this work we have investigated the impact of interstitial Fe contamination on the effective minority carrier lifetime of n type Cz silicon bulk material for high efficiency solar cells . The study covers a Fe concentration in the silicon bulk from 3.510

@highlight The impact of interstitial Fe contamination on the effective minority carrier lifetime of n type cz silicon was investigated.
@highlight The study covers a Fe concentration in the silicon bulk from 3.5 10
@highlight cm
@highlight to 2.7 10
@highlight cm
@highlight Five different concentrations 30 100 300 1000 and 3000ppb of Fe were added intentionally to a wet chemical process.
@highlight The surface Fe contamination is driven into the bulk mimicking a high temperature process during solar cell manufacturing.
@highlight The capture cross section for interstitial Fe could be extracted to be 6.45 10
@highlight cm s 2.23 10
@highlight cm s in good consensus with literature.
