 We performed detailed first principles Density Functional Theory Calculations of electronic band structure and predict the effective mass as well as the electronic fitness function

@highlight TaCoSn and TaIrSn are two newly discovered stable half Heusler compounds we determined some properties of the compounds using first principles method. The highlights are 
@highlight Presentation of the orbital contributions to the band structure via fat band determination.
@highlight Dependence of Seebeck coefficient on holes concentration.
@highlight Calculations of effective masses of the compounds.
@highlight Determination of electronic fitness function in both compounds.
