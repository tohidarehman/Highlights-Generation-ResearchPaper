 The conventional way to fabricate current sub ambient daytime radiative cooling systems is to maximally suppress the cooler s solar absorption and substantially improve its selective emissivity only in the atmospheric transparency window . This greatly limits the selection of materials and their practical applications . In this paper an alternative method which combines sunlight triggered fluorescent cooling particle scattering and broadband infrared radiation was presented for creating serial eco friendly coatings with the SDRC effect with conventional cost effective building materials . The presence of conventional fluorescent pigments in the coating composition increased the effective direct normal solar reflectance via sunlight excited fluorescent emissions to the level required for SDRC . When applied to various substrates the serial coatings exhibited distinct SDRC effects under direct and strong sunlight in typical temperate monsoon climate regions such as Beijing . The observed sub ambient temperature reduction of the coating with yellowgreen fluorescence over an aluminium plate was 3.5C under a peak solar intensity of 996W m
