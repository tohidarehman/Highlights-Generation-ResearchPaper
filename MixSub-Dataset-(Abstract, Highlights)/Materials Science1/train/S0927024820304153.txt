 Directional solidification of a cast mono silicon seed and of a float zone silicon seed was performed and the grain and defect structures of the seeds as well as of the regrown parts are analyzed .

@highlight X ray diffraction imaging EBSD and etching are used to characterize subgrains in a cast mono silicon seeded sample.
@highlight The subgrain boundaries grow with the solid liquid interface and cross or follow 3 and 9 grain boundaries during growth.
@highlight Subrain formation is probably related to the initial cellular dislocation structure in the seed crystal.
@highlight A special grain orientation relationship constitutes an obstacle for the propagation of the subgrain boundaries.
