 Here we report a method using laser beam induced current measurements to ascertain nonresponsive features of photovoltaic devices that are smaller than the measurement beam size . To demonstrate the method we determine the effective electrical width of laser scribed lines . Laser scribing is a critical process in producing thin film photovoltaics modules and minimizing the effective width of the laser scribed lines is important for closing the cell to module efficiency gap . However in addition to removing material laser scribing can also produce a heat affected zone in which the optoelectronic properties of the remaining materials may be adversely impacted . We measured the LBIC signal across scribe lines that were produced in CdTe thin films . The collected data was compared with the expectations based on the probing beam s shape and the profile of the scribed line . The approach allows the electrical dead width to be determined with a resolution that is substantially higher than the width of the LBIC beam . At the lowest scribing powers where the lines were the smallest the electrically determined widths were larger than the optically determined widths by nearly a factor of two . The ability to rapidly resolve features that are much smaller than the dimensions of the probing laser beam without the use of confocal optics may be useful in a manufacturing environment as demonstrated here or more generally for rapid defect identification on devices with areas ranging from centimeters up to meters .

@highlight Laser beam induced current LBIC is used to measure scribes that have a width smaller than measurement beam diameter.
@highlight The LBIC laser beam intensity profile is used to deconvolute the device current generation from the measured LBIC signal.
@highlight Defect features with orders of magnitude smaller sizes than the probing laser beam size can be identified.
