 Mixed tin lead iodide perovskite is considered the most promising low bandgap photovoltaic material for pursuing both low toxicity and high performance of perovskite solar cells . However their performance is still lagging behind the full Pb based analogues . In PSCs the hole transport layer is one of the most important fundamentals to affect the device performance . Herein the FASnI

@highlight Perovskite solar cells based on the 60 Sn perovskite were fabricated.
@highlight A CuI PEDOT PSS bilayer structure was employed to fabricate perovskite solar cells.
@highlight The introduced CuI can facilitate high quality film growth of FASnI
@highlight  MAPbI
@highlight Photovoltaic performance of devices was significantly dependent on the CuI thickness.
@highlight The double hole transport layer induced improving PCE and durability of devices.
