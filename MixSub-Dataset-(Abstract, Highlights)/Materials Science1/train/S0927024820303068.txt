 Radiative cooling is becoming more popular in various applications since the heat is dissipated passively with zero energy consumption . Radiative cooling for metallic substrates was developed in this study via electrophoretic deposition of a chitosan layer . The tailored optical properties generality to different metals and the cost effectiveness of the employed fabrication facility are described . The deposited areas are scalable without requiring high precision lithography and the chitosan itself has trivial environmental impacts . The addition of the chitosan layer increased the thermal emissions of stainless steel and platinum substrates by 52.4W m

@highlight Deposited chitosan layers cooled stainless steel and platinum samples radiatively.
@highlight Chitosan tailors optical properties and has trivial environmental impacts.
@highlight Chitosan thickness is estimated by ellipsometry combined linear regression modeling.
@highlight Thermal emission of stainless steel increased 9.0 times 52.4W m
@highlight  with chitosan.
@highlight Chitosan deposited stainless steel dropped 2.4C and 4.4C respectively in humid and dry environments.
