 The present work presents results from an analysis of the mode I and II interfacial fracture behavior of a new adhesive joint between thin titanium and CFRP adherents that is destined for application in the future aircraft s leading edge . The joint is stiffened with two aluminum beams to prevent large deformations during testing . An engineering approach for the design of fracture toughness tests for the present joint is followed . The vacuum assisted resin transfer molding technique is employed for the manufacturing of specimens subsequently tested using the double cantilever beam and the end notched flexure configurations . Towards the fracture toughness determination from the experimental data a new analytical model that considers the bending extension coupling induced by the presence of the aluminum beams and the manufacturing induced residual thermal stresses is applied . The analytical fracture toughness predictions are validated by two dimensional finite element analyses . Crack propagation analyses based on the virtual crack closure technique and the cohesive zone modeling are performed to capture the experimental behavior and extract useful fracture toughness properties of the joint . A comparison of various literature s data reduction schemes reveals the level of error if factors such as the bending extension coupling and or the residual thermal stresses are ignored .
