 Recently interfacial solar driven evaporation has received tremendous attention due to its potential for enhancing solar thermal conversation ability via heat localization at the evaporation interface . Diverse materials and configurations have been explored to boost the evaporation using plastic foam as the thermal insulator at the cost of complex assembly and environmental threats . Herein we demonstrate a biodegradable cost effective and scalable three dimensional cotton paper based solar steam generator prepared by one step laser induced forward transfer in the ambient atmosphere . The as prepared evaporator has excellent solar absorption ability . The defining advantages of this method are that it can easily form a 3D structure and it is free from hazardous raw material involvement and waste generation . With further novel design by using a natural air gap instead of artificial plastic material to insulate the steam generation area and the underlying bulk water the as prepared evaporation system can achieve a high evaporation rate of 1711gm
