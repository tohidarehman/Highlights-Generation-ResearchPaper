 The peculiarities of microstructure of nanocrystalline powders of nonstoichiometric niobium carbides have been generalized in all homogeneity interval of cubic NbC

@highlight Nanocrystalline powders of carbides NbC
@highlight are produced by high energy ball milling.
@highlight Microstructure of nanopowders is investigated by time of flight neutron diffraction.
@highlight Nanopowders contain two fractions with different composition and particle size.
@highlight Anisotropy of microstrains is very important in strongly deformed milled nanopowders.
@highlight The splitting of NbC
@highlight particles during milling occurs along 110 plane with least shear modulus.
