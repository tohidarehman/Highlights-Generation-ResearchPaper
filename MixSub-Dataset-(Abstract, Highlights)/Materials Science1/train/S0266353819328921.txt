 Based on the urgent demand of excellent wetting mechanical strength electrospun nanofiber separators and some doping compounds which are beneficial to enhance electrochemical performance for Li ion cell in this study a natty nanofiber composite membrane based on heat resistant polyimide matrix via introducing polar Octa polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane nanoparticles for the first time is resoundingly prepared by electrospinning technology . The hybrid PI OCP POSS separator with 3.5wt OCP POSS nanoparticles presents significant improvement in wetting mechanical strength eminent electrolyte retention rate together with a tendency of gelation phase and still exerts laudable high thermal stability . Meanwhile the battery with the HOPS separator exhibits preferable electrochemical stability window and exceedingly excellent ionic conductivity 2.810
