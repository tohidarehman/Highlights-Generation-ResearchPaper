 The concept and design of a photovoltaic system for harvesting salt and electricity at salt farm floor were proposed for the first time . Various concepts and designs were explored from the point of view of waterproofing salt resistance material and electrical safety maintenance and economic feasibility . Even though the concept and design are still evolving through field tests the first generation design of a photovoltaic system applied on the salt farm floor is unveiled . The power generation of the salt farm parallel system is comparable to that of conventional solar power plants . The cooling effect by seawater contributes more to the increase in the crystalline silicon photovoltaic module performance than does the absorption loss due to seawater by maintaining a certain height above the module .

@highlight The concept of salt farm parallel solar power plant is proposed first time in the world.
@highlight Salt farm modules showed higher electricity generation than land installed modules.
@highlight Cooling effect by sea water plays a role enhancing electricity generation.
@highlight Power generation of salt farm system is comparable to conventional solar power plants.
