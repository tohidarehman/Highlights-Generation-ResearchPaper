 To improve the use efficiency and broaden the application fields of PCMs in solar thermal energy storage the poly based polyurethane wood powder graphene oxide composite shape stabilized phase change materials with high thermal conductivity were successfully designed and prepared by using PEG as the phase change working substance WP and GO nanosheets as the supporting matrix and the GO nanosheets as the thermally conductive filler simultaneously . Scanning electron microscopy and X ray photoemission spectrometer reveal that the GO nanosheets were successful deposited on the WP surface via the simple impregnation process . With the increasing content of WP and GO the thermal conductivity of PU
