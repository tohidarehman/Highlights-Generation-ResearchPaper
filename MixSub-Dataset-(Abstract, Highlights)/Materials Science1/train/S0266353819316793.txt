 A novel multi stimuli responsive silica nanocomposite with a core shell structure is synthesized using reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization . The SiO

@highlight Preparation of core shell multi stimuli responsive nanocomposite via RAFT polymerization.
@highlight The macro RAFT agent was prepared by NIPAM SOM and DDMAT.
@highlight The synthesized smart nanocomposite showed multi stimuli responsivity with high performance in solutions and neat powder.
@highlight The smart nanocomposite excellent response to UV light pH temperature and the combination of pH and temperature.
