 The construction of highly efficient photo induced degradation methods is essential for water remediation . A novel nanocomposite was firstly synthesized which was consisted of Ag nanoparticles immobilized on black phosphorus nanosheets

@highlight nanocomposite was successfully prepared.
@highlight Enhanced photo induced activity was observed in NIR light.
@highlight exhibited high photo induced degradation efficiency of norfloxacin.
@highlight produced .O
@highlight by harvest of NIR light and high electron hole.
