 We demonstrate an industrial tunnel oxide passivated contacts silicon solar cell on large area n type silicon wafers . This cell has a boron diffused front emitter a tunnel SiO

@highlight We demonstrate i TOPCon cells with a best efficiency of 24.58 on 156.75mm156.75mm.

@highlight  poly Si films on wafers show an excellent contact passivation.
@highlight Major power losses are in the emitter including its bulk surface metal contacts.
