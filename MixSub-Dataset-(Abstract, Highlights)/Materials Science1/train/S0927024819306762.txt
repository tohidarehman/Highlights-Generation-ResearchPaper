 Indium tin oxide based multilayer structures with ultrathin silver deposition on colorless polyimide were investigated as touch sensor electrode materials in this study . The electrical optical structural and morphological properties of the ITO based multilayer structures were compared . The figure of merit of the ITO Ag ITO CPI multilayer structure in which the bottom ITO layer was deposited at 160C was calculated using Haacke s formula and the value was found to be 63.610

@highlight The ITO Ag ITO multilayer structure as the electrode fabrication on touch panel.
@highlight The SiO
@highlight as the passivation layer enhance the transmittance of the multilayer structure.
@highlight Ultra high optical transmittance of the SiO
@highlight  ITO Ag ITO CPI multilayer structure was 94.6 .
