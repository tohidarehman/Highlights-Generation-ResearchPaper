 Environmental concerns over chemicals used for protecting wood and wood products from biological degradation have prompted the development of natural wood preservatives with lower health risks and prolonged efficacy . In this study an effective and environmentally friendly method is demonstrated to substantially improve the durability of a strand based wood composite product by incorporating a natural wood preservative system . Specifically allyl isothiocyanate a mustard oil based natural biocide was encapsulated into the cavity of cyclodextrin and the as prepared CD AITC complex was applied in the strand based composite manufacturing process to produce a natural preservative treated engineered wood panel . The formation of the CD AITC complex was qualitatively confirmed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the inclusion yield of AITC was estimated to be 71 by thermogravimetric analysis . The preservative complex was blended with southern pine strands at 0 5 and 10 prior to the application of polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate resin and hot pressing . The application of the preservative system significantly improved decay resistance against brown rot fungi
