 Luminescent nanocrystals based luminescent solar concentrators are promising as a new concept for solar energy collection . The reabsorption behavior and the stability are two critical issues for the luminophores in LSCs . Here low loss LSCs are demonstrated based on silica encapsulated CdSe CdS quantum rods

@highlight Demonstrating low loss LSCs based on CdSe 
@highlight QRs with large Stokes shift.
@highlight QRs were encapsulated into silica shells to enhance the stability.
@highlight Layer to layer structure obtained by doctor blading avoids absorption loss.
@highlight align due to self assembly and benefit to the edge emitting.
@highlight LSCs shows low reabsorption and high edge efficiency.
