 Solar steam generation based on light absorbing materials has been considered to be one of the most effective methods to alleviate the problem of water shortage . Herein a novel 3D network structure and hydrophobic Ni G WO

@highlight The 3D Ni G WO
@highlight evaporator was first prepared for solar steam generation.
@highlight Strong light absorption by the synergistic effect of porous Ni graphene and WO
@highlight A high evaporation efficiency of 85 was achieved under 1 sun illumination.
@highlight The evaporator has a strong ability to desalination and purify sewage.
