 Solar cells with polysilicon based passivating and carrier selective contacts are in the nascent stages of industrialization . Advances in commercially available metallization pastes are necessary to further improve the efficiency of industrial polysilicon based solar cells and approach the best reported lab efficiency of such cells . In this work we have analyzed the front and rear screen printed metallization of large area

@highlight Poly Si based passivating contacts result in lower recombination current densities hence higher cell voltages.
@highlight Screen printed fire through metallization enabler for mass production with minimal loss in passivation.
@highlight Improvements in metal pastes for screen printed and fire through metallization result in higher cell voltages.
@highlight Cell efficiencies of 23 obtained for cells with best combination of front and rear metal paste and busbar less grid.
@highlight Higher cell efficiencies limited by the recombination from the front surface of a rear passivated contact solar cell.
