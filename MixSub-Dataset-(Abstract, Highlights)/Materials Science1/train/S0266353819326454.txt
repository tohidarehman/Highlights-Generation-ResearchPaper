 Flexible dielectric nanocomposites have shown great potential for electrostatic capacitors due to their excellent energy storage properties . In an effort to eliminate the disadvantages induced by the interfacial polarization of two different components in the nanocomposite in this work HfO

@highlight Core shell structured HfO
@highlight @BaTiO
@highlight nanoparticles are synthesized for the first time.
@highlight The 1wt P VDF HFP HfO
@highlight @BT nanocomposite film has maximum discharged energy density of 10.7J cm
@highlight The introduction of HfO
@highlight layer leads to more evenly distributed electric field in the nanocomposites.
