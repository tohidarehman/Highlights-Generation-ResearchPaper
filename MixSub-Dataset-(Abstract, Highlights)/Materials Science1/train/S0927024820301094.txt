 The first principle molecular dynamics simulations in combination with experimental measurements are applied to investigate the thermophysical properties and structural evolution of MgCl

@highlight Thermophysical properties of MgCl
@highlight NaClKCl MNK eutectic were simulated by FPMD.
@highlight Density and thermal diffusivity of molten MNK were first determined experimentally.
@highlight Microstructural evolution of MNK eutectic during melting was elaborated.
@highlight Relationship of structure and viscosity of MNK eutectic was revealed.
