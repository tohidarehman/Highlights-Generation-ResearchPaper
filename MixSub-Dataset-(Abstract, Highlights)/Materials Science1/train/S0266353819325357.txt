 Silanized plasticizer was chemically derived and synthesized from soybean oil co vulcanized with bis propyl tetrasulfide by using the sulfur accelerated curing system . SP extended styrene butadiene rubber silica composites have been studied for their improved filler dispersion through coupling interaction at the SBR silica interface . The effect of SP on cross link density thermal static and dynamic mechanical properties of SBR composites related to the tire performance were investigated . The results revealed that SP enhanced tensile strength modulus and hardness of the composites due to an improved matrix filler interaction together with an excellent control over oil migration . Further improvement was observed for SP with increasing TESPT content what was related to the increase in cross linking density and bound rubber content of the composite materials . Morphology and reduced Payne effect confirmed the silica particles have an even dispersion throughout the SBR matrix . The dynamic curves indicated the highest efficacy for wet and dry traction performances of SP extended SBR composites comparing to unmodified reference sample . This research provided the effect of SP as a novel reactive bio plasticizer to improve the performance of SBR silica composites for green tire manufacture while being eco friendly .
