 In this paper we present the synchrotron and laboratory X ray powder diffraction experiments made at normal conditions and also at different pressures . Then crystal structure and equation of state have been determined . These results are discussed together with experimental phase diagram . The binary phases of the SnTi Ti

@highlight An ordered ternary phase was identified and studied under mechanical pressure by investigating the phase equilibrium along the section Ti
@highlight Sn Ni.
