 A 3D convection diffusion reaction model was developed to describe CO oxidation in a continuous flow catalytic reactor containing a Pd single crystal surface . The model was studied with the help of the pseudo arclength continuation algorithm which is based on a matrix free NewtonKrylov method and enables a one parameter continuation of stationary solutions of large systems . The model was used to simulate the 3D spatial distributions of CO and CO

@highlight CO oxidation on Pd 100 in the mass transfer limited regime was modeled.
@highlight PLIF experimental data were simulated with realistic values of kinetic parameters.
@highlight Inhomogeneous spatial distributions of CO and CO
@highlight during oscillations were calculated.
@highlight The formation of a boundary layer near the catalyst surface was shown.
@highlight Metallic catalytic sites represent the most active phase on a partially oxidized catalyst.
