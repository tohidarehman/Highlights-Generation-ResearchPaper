 Since 2017 the efficiency record for cast multi crystalline silicon solar cells has been 22.3 using a TOPCon design on a 22cm

@highlight We demonstrate TOPCon cells with a best efficiency of 23.22 on large area quasi mono wafers.
@highlight We analyses the bulk lifetime before and after cell fabrication.
@highlight We give details about the optimization of the rear passivating contact.
