 Mesoporous calcium silicate was synthesized using the ultrasonic assisted template method by using calcium nitrate tetrahydrate and sodium metasilicate nonahydrate as raw materials and cetyltrimethylammonium bromidemethenamine as the template . X ray diffraction Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy and BrunauerEmmettTeller method were used for the characterization of MCS . The surface charge characteristics of MCS and its adsorption characteristics for Ni
