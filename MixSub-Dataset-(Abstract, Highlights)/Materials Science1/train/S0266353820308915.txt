 The performance of cellulosic filler polyolefin biocomposites is affected by the filler dispersion in the matrix . However this mechanistic factor is generally inferred from the physical properties of the final bulk material because of the limitations of analytical techniques . Herein we propose a simple method to quantitatively evaluate the dispersion of filler particles . To accomplish this the cellulose component in injection molded specimens of microcrystalline cellulose maleic anhydride modified polypropylene polypropylene composites was selectively fluorescently labeled with calcofluor white and the dispersion state of tens of thousands of MCC particles observed by fluorescence microscopy was analyzed . The close range aggregation behavior of the MCC particles can be evaluated by the area of the fluorescent particles

@highlight Fluorescent labeling of cellulosic filler in biocomposites can be easily performed.
@highlight Image analysis can separately evaluate aggregation and arrangement of the filler.
@highlight The image analysis data could distinguish the performance of compatibilizer.
@highlight The image analysis data correlated with strengths and water absorption.
@highlight This fluorescence method was also applicable to cellulose nanofiber composites.
