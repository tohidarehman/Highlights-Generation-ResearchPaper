 Glutamic acid clinoptilolite nanoparticles was used for the Mn removal in aquatic media . XRD FT IR SEM TG analyzer and energy dispersive analysis X ray spectroscopy were used for the characterization of the raw and the modified samples . Initial experiments showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 0.572mmol Mn g for the raw CNP while the modified CNP GA showed a value of 0.691mmol Mn g confirming the positive role of the CNP modification in Mn removal . Designing the experiments by response surface methodology showed a quadratic model for the processing of the data obtained in the removal process . The optimum conditions to achieve maximum adsorption were suggested as initial Mn concentration 583mg L contact time 132min CNP GA dosage 5gL
