 The energy density of a rechargeable device may be determined by the specific capacity of electrodes and the potential difference between the anode and cathode . Therefore high specific capacitances are required for energy storage devices with high energy densities . Electrodes with high surface areas generally provide good contact between the electrode and electrolyte hence the electrode material is important for supercapacitor applications . The structure and surface area of the electrodes may be affected by fabrication parameters and processes used . As the structure of the electrode is related to the performance of energy storage devices electrodeposition parameters of electrodes were studied . In this research the effect of electrodeposition potential on cobalt structure and capacitive performance of resulting electrodes were reported . Co based film was cathodically electrodeposited by applying different potentials on the graphite electrode . Morphological and structural characteristics of coatings were examined by SEM and FTIR . The electrodes were then immersed in an alkaline bath for capacitance measurements . The rate limiting reactions of the electrodes in KOH depending on deposition potential was studied . The galvanostatic charge discharge curves for the negative graphite electrode and positive cobalt based electrode were obtained . Electrochemical performances of the nano composite electrodes varied with the applied voltages . The electrode showed a maximum specific capacity of 1692Fg
