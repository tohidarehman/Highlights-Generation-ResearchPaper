 Resin matrix of carbon fiber reinforced resin laminates play a key role in transferring the external stress to carbon fibers . Especially in cryogenic environment the mechanical properties of CF reinforced resin laminates depend largely on the mechanical properties of resin matrix . In this work an epoxy functional polysiloxane Nano SiO

@highlight An epoxy functionalized polysiloxane Nano SiO
@highlight was prepared by simple co hydrolytic condensation reaction.
@highlight The grafting of EFPS on the surface of Nano SiO
@highlight can improve the dispersion of Nano SiO
@highlight in epoxy resin.
@highlight The EFPS and Nano SiO
@highlight can synergistically enhance the mechanical properties of epoxy and composite laminate.
@highlight Thermal cycling can affect the tensile properties of composite laminates.
