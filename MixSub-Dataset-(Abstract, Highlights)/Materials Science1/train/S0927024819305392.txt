 Cheap and efficient encapsulation methods are needed for successful commercialization of organic photovoltaics . Application of epoxy or acrylic UV curable adhesives is a fast and scalable way to encapsulate organic solar cells . Despite lower barrier properties acrylates have some benefits over epoxies such as higher cure speed better adhesion to various substrates lower viscosity and increased mechanical flexibility . In this work commercial and novel acrylic monomers were applied for encapsulation of OPV . It was found that monomers with phenyl ethyl ester group can have very high adhesion to polyethylene terephthalate good barrier properties and good compatibility with a layer stack of OPV devices .

@highlight Acrylic UV curable adhesives for OPV encapsulation were developed.
@highlight The adhesives have good curing speed flexibility and compatibility with OPV devices.
@highlight Novel monomers were synthetized and compared with commercial monomers.
@highlight Novel monomers have higher molecular weight and low cure shrinkage.
