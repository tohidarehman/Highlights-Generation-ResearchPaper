 In this work we design prototype test and analyse the first high performance Herringbone Bouligand microstructure inspired to the high impact resistant mantis shrimp s dactyl club . To this end we devised the first prototyping procedure to manufacture point by point tailorable Herringbone Bouligand CFRP microstructures this was based on the micro moulding of uncured CFRP prepreg and led to mimicking features of the club microstructure never achieved before with CFRPs . We investigated the damage tolerance of the prototyped Herringbone Bouligand CFRP laminates compared against classical Bouligand CFRP laminates using quasi static indentation tests . Our test results show that the Herringbone Bouligand microstructure resulted in delayed onset of delaminations reduced in plane spreading of damage increased energy dissipation capability and in the containment of damage within the tailored Herringbone Bouligand region . We conclude that Herringbone Bouligand CFRP microstructures offer an excellent tailorable damage tolerant solution with great potential for composite applications where resistance to through the thickness loads is paramount .
