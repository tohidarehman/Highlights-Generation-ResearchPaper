 Recent photoluminescence and admittance spectroscopy measurements point towards the defect responsible for Light Induced Degradation being a shallow level . Dopant dependent lifetime spectroscopy and temperature dependent lifetime spectroscopy on the other hand reveal the existence of a deep level driving the recombination activity of the LID defects . There is an apparent disagreement between admittance spectroscopy results and lifetime spectroscopy results . Here we overcome this apparent disagreement and we show that a negative U defect with one shallow level can explain both the doping dependent lifetime data and injection dependent data . The critical consequence of this model is that it readily explains the dependence of the LID defect on the hole concentration rather than the Boron concentration .

@highlight Describe the discrepancy between Admittance Spectroscopy Photoluminescence Spectroscopy and Lifetime Spectroscopy results.
@highlight Highlight the meaninglessness of the effective defect density for shallow levels.
@highlight Provide to a certain extent a unified interpretation of the LID defect as a shallow level that explains both Admittance Spectroscopy and Lifetime Spectroscopy including the dependence of the LID defect on the net doping rather than the boron concentration.
