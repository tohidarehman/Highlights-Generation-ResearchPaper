 Renewable energy has become of great interest over the past years in order to mitigate Global Warming . One of the actions gaining attention is the enhancement of the thermal energy storage capacity of Concentrated Solar Power plants . The addition of nanoencapsulated phase change materials to the already used materials has been proposed for that purpose due to the possibility of increasing thermal storage through the contribution of both core latent heat and sensible heat . In this work Atomic Layer Deposition has been used to synthesise SiO
