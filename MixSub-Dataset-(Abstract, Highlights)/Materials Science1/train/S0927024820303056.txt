 We have investigated new nano materials for their applicability as ice snow melting agents . They are based on nano textured anti reflective Si and compared with standard agents used in the industry . Nano needles of black Si decrease surface reflectance and enhance absorption of sunlight by Si . The effective ice snow melting properties of the black Si based samples outperform the most widely used chaff charcoal . This newest solar photo thermal conversion material agent has high potential to the farming in early springs at relative cold regions .

@highlight Highly effective snow ice melting agent than ever.
@highlight Re usable silicon based materials.
@highlight High efficiency of photo thermal conversion material.
