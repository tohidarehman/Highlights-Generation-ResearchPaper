 Solid polymer electrolytes replacing traditional liquid electrolytes are considered as an important strategy for developing lithium metal batteries with high safety and energy density . However poor ionic conductivity and weak mechanical performances have greatly limited the development of solid polymer electrolytes . Here we dispersed inorganic ceramic particles Li
