 In this work highly stable and efficient perovskite solar cells in n i p configuration has been fabricated . Application of poly interlayer into the perovskite films via solution based process and quaternary semiconductor Cu

@highlight CMTS nanostructure particles used as HTM and PVP applied as an interlayer.
@highlight Formation of PVP CMTS nanostructure particles interface leads to passivation of the trap states.
@highlight The PCSs based on CZTS HTM retained 97 of initial efficiency during 30 day due to the presence of PVP interlayer.
@highlight CZTS based devices with PVP interlayer reached the PCE of 13.57 and V
@highlight of 1.03V with low hysteresis.
