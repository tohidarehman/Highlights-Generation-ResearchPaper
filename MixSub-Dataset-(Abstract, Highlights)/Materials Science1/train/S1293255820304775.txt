 The paper presents the results of a study of the effect of the applied potentials difference on the properties of thin films based on CoCdSe . It is shown that the use of the galvanic deposition method allows not only controlling the thickness of the synthesized films by changing the applied potentials difference but also changing the stoichiometric and phase composition of thin films . It was found that an increase in the applied potentials difference leads to the domination of the CoSe phase in the structure of thin films leading to structural ordering and a decrease in the dislocation density of defects and an increase in the density of thin films . It was found that the formation of the CoSe phase in the structure of thin films and its subsequent increase leads to a shift in the band gap from 3.5eV to 3.8eV . The change in the band gap is caused by a change in the phase composition as well as stoichiometry of thin films with a predominance of cadmium in the structure . The prospects of using thin films based on CoCdSe as the basis for photocatalytic reactions are shown .
