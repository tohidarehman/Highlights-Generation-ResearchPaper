 Nanofluids have an advanced application prospect in the community of heat transfer fluids and particularly for the direct absorption solar collector . But most of body of available researches gave more attention to the thermal conductivity or rheology . We recently reported on the thermal conductivity and optical properties of the cyclodextrin modified carbon nanotubes nanofluids . In this paper we focused on the specific heat capacity and photo thermal conversion performance of ethylene glycol based CD CNTs nanofluids for DASC system . To this end a series of CD CNTs nanofluids with different volume fractions were prepared . The specific heat capacity decreased with the increase of CD CNTs loadings and the highest decrement in specific heat capacity was found to be 9.07 for 0.1vol . In addition the temperature had significant effect over specific heat capacity of the studied nanofluids . The volume concentration and irradiation duration time put an effect on the photo thermal conversion efficiency . In the nanofluid with appropriate concentration the photothermal conversion performance was improved with the extension of light irradiation time and the possible mechanism of carbon nanotube agglomeration was qualitatively analyzed . In summary the promising features could ensure the CD CNTs nanofluids application prospect to be utilized in practical DASC system .
