 We perform the first principles calculation based on density functional theory to study the structural electronic and mechanical properties of two MgSiO

@highlight Discover the transition pressure of monoclinic MgSiO
@highlight and trigonal MgSiO
@highlight according to the enthalpy values.
@highlight For the first time offer a comparison of the band gaps of MgSiO
@highlight under pressure within GGA PBE and HSE06.
@highlight Carry out a study under higher pressure up to 150 GPa for trigonal MgSiO
@highlight and 100 GPa for monoclinic MgSiO
