 Fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction is important to produce hydrogen fuel on a large scale via electrocatalytic water splitting . In this research a novel electrocatalyst based on star like molybdenum phosphide structure vertically grown on highly conductive graphene supported by a three dimensional nickel foam was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method followed by a phosphidization strategy at 300C . The exclusive hierarchical nanostructure with abundant porosity was beneficial for enhancing active site numbers and electrical conductivity . In particular the formation of MoP impressively changed electronic structure of the resulting material thereby accelerating electrocatalytic activity for HER in 1.0M KOH medium . The MoP GR NF required small overpotentials of 95 and 189mV to deliver current densities of 10 and 50mAcm
