 The Calcium Looping process based on the reversible carbonation calcination of CaO is a promising technology for thermochemical energy storage in Concentrated Solar Power plants . However the major drawback of this technology is the rapid deactivation of CaO due to sintering . In this work we have synthesized CaO based inert oxide stabilized composites through a space confined chemical vapor deposition process . Different synthesis parameters such as the inert material Al

@highlight Ca based composites were synthesized by a facile chemical vapor deposition process.
@highlight The sintering of CaO crystalline grains were inhibited through inert oxide deposition.
@highlight Only 5mol of Al
@highlight is required to effectively enhance the stability of heat storage.
@highlight The energy density of the composite still close to the theoretical value after 50 cycles.
