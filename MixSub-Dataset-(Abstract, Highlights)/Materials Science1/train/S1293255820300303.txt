 A co operative non aqueous self assembly route has been demonstrated to prepare zinc glycolate complexes those are further used to engineer zinc oxide nanoparticles . Lyotropic nanocolloids are prepared via dispersing the different amount of ZnO nanoparticles in non aqueous lyotropic phases . Hexagonal to lamellar phase transition has been observed in the lyotropic nanocolloids with the addition of ZnO NPs as confirmed from the structural characterizations . Optical properties like refractive indices and birefringence of LLC is strongly modified with ZnO NPs doping . The stronger dipole moment of the NPs shifted the optical band gap of nanocolloids from semiconducting to insulating region and also influenced the net dielectric permittivity of the nanocolloids . The conductivity of the nanocolloids is measured and correlated with the optical band gap and dielectric dynamics . In addition nanocolloids show ionic charge capturing properties .

@highlight ZnO NPS have been prepared via new co operative non aqueous self assembly route.
