 The spinel bimetal oxides with high specific surface area are favorable to promote the energy storage performance of Li ion batteries . A facile and fast colloidal solution combustion strategy is explored to the batch scale synthesis of porous zinc manganese oxide ZnMn

@highlight Porous ZnMn
@highlight with high SSA was prepared by colloidal solution combustion strategy.
@highlight The colloidal silica solution has a great influence on the SSA.
@highlight The ZnMn
@highlight 300 electrode shows superior Li storage performance.
