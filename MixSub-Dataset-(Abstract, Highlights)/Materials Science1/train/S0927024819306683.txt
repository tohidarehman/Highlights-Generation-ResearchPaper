 Two dimensional semiconductor materials have attracted much attention in solar energy utilization due to their unique structure and excellent photoelectrical properties . However the band bending in the 2D materials based photoelectrodes is limited when the thickness of 2D flakes are too thin which normally leads to weak driving force for charge separation and transfer . Constructing heterojunction is an effective way to enhance the band bending by creating additional space charge layer in semiconductors . Herein we intentionally introduce a 2D SnS
