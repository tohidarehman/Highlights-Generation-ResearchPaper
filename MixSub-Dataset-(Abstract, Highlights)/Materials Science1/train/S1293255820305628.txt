 Well organized hollow hierarchical hydroxyapatite microspheres were prepared hydrothermally via a template free process . Citrate was used as chelating or morphology regulating agent in this study . In the presence of regulating agent two dimensional monetite phase evolved into three dimensional hollow hydroxyapatite microspheres with an average diameter of 4m . Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed the importance of Citrate Calcium ratio in regulating the particle morphology . The results indicate that the surface morphology of microspheres can be engineered from nanosheets to nanorods by regulating agent concentration . X ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed crystallinity and purity in the synthesized powders . Brunauer Emmett Teller indicated an increase in the specific surface area with the change from hydroxyapatite microspheres with nanosheets to hydroxyapatite microspheres with nanorods on the surface . Thermodynamic and kinetic theories are proposed to account for the observed changes in the surface morphology and crystal growth .
