 The impact of non covalent interactions and reaction conditions on formation and self assembly of ionic pairs of Rh complexes with 4 4 disubstituted bipyridine ligands

@highlight Metallophilic chains can be obtained by controlling the non covalent interactions.
@highlight Utilization of different interactions can be used for changing the assembly of metal complexes in solid state.
@highlight Crystallization conditions determine the assembly metal complexes.
