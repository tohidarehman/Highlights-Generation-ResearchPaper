 In this study shape stabilized composite phase change materials were fabricated by the impregnation method based on dodecanoic acid as energy storage material and graphene as a supporting matrix . The supporting material was prepared via in situ filling with Na

@highlight Multifunctional composite PCMs were synthesized via an in situ synthesis method.
@highlight The composite PCMs achieved up to 101.4 thermal energy storage capacity than expected energy storage capacity.
@highlight The composite exhibited a photo thermal conversion capacity up to 78 .
@highlight The stability and thermal conductivity of composite PCMs were highly improved.
