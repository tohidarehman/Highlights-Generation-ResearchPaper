 A perfect spectrally selective solar absorber based on dielectric filled fishnet shape tungsten grating has been proposed and numerically investigated . The designed structure achieves a total solar absorption efficiency higher than 94 and a total emittance less than 5 at 100C resulting in a total photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.4 irradiated by one sun . In addition the proposed selective solar absorber exhibits nearly perfect absorption in visible and near infrared regions and the underlying physical mechanisms for the excellent performance including the impedance matching with surrounding medium surface plasmon resonances and cavity resonances are elucidated in detail . Furthermore effects of the proposed solar absorber geometric parameters on the absorption properties of it are also analyzed . Moreover the solar absorber exhibits angular independence up to 60 and polarization insensitivity . The proposed spectrally selective solar absorber promises potentially valuable applications for thermophotovoltaic conversion thermal emitters solar energy harvesting and so on .
