 Perovskite solar cells have been appearing as a superior photovoltaic device owing to their high photovoltaic performance and low cost of fabrication . The formation of a compact and uniform perovskite layer with large crystal size is a significant factor to get the best device performance . In this work polyvinylidene difluoride was used as a ferroelectric polymer additive to fabricate high performance mesoporous CH

@highlight Ferroelectric polymer additives PVDF significantly increase the PCE of mixed halide perovskite solar cells.
@highlight 18.6 efficiency is reached after directing dipoles by external bias.
@highlight The enhancement is associated with both morphological smoothness and the local dipole field.
@highlight Ferroelectric polymer promotes efficient electron extraction and the lower charge carrier recombination.
@highlight The electron transfer layer perovskite interface is very critical.
