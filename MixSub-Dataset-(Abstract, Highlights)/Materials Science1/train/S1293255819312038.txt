 In this article a simple and environmentally benign one pot hydrothermal strategy has been developed for the synthesis of nano grass flower hierarchical manganese dioxide without the use of either templets or acid . Because of synergistic effects of nano grass and nano flower the nano grass flower hierarchical structure exhibits specific capacitance of 230Fg
