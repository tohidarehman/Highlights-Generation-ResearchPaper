 Exploring the inherent spectral selectivity of ultra high temperature ceramics is of great significance to prepare solar absorber coatings with a simple structure and low cost . The present work shows a further improvement towards the design and deposition of the multilayer spectrally selective absorber coatings based on HfB

@highlight solar absorber coating is designed by CODE software.
@highlight The coating exhibits a high spectral selectivity of 0.93 0.07.
@highlight After 5 cycling thermal shock resistance experiments the optical properties do not degrade.
@highlight Oxidation is the main reason for the optical attenuation of the coating.
