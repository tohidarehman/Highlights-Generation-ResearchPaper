 Two dimensional photocatalysts have attracted increasing attentions in the past decades due to their unique physical and chemical properties . In this work the photocatalytic performance of TiSe

@highlight TiSe
@highlight plates was synthesized by a facile trioctylphosphine free chemical method.
@highlight TiSe
@highlight plates with thickness of 35nm have good dispersity and crystallinity.
@highlight The photocatalytic performance and the degradation mechanism are studied.
@highlight The Rh B solution is degraded 96 after 30min irradiation.
