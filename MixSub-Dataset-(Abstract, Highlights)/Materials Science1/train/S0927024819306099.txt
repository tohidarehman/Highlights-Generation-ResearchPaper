 Organic phase change materials are broadly used in thermal energy storage systems especially for the efficient utilization of solar energy and industrial waste heat whereas their low shape stability and poor heat transfer performance have hindered the practical applications . In this work we aim at producing high performance phase change composites with high anisotropic thermal conductivity and good shape stability . The PCCs are supported by a biomass derived porous carbon scaffolds which are constructed with graphene wrapped and vertically aligned hollow carbon fibers . The PCC with a filler content of 8.5wt exhibits a high lateral thermal conductivity of 1.36Wm

@highlight Heat transfer properties of paraffin PCM were reinforced by carbon scaffold with unique structure.
@highlight Biomass carbon scaffold consisted of 1D aligned and graphene wrapped carbon fibers was prepared.
@highlight Composite showed anisotropically high thermal conductivity of 2.68Wm
@highlight  10.7 times improved.
@highlight Composite showed high latent heat good shape stability and thermal reliability.
