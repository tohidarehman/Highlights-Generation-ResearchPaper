 The utilization of boron doped Si solar cells based on the structure of a passivated emitter and rear cell in the solar industry has increased recently . However this type of high efficiency solar cell is exposed to a so called light and elevated temperature induced degradation . A suppressing of mc Si LeTID has been studied through a regeneration treatment at high temperature under illumination or in the dark but most was about the lifetime samples . In this work to evaluate the applicability of regeneration and annealing at industrial relevant conditions industrially made BGa co doped cast mono Si PERC solar cells were treated in a light soaking tool in which the intensity of light and substrate temperature could be adjusted separately and a rapid thermal process system . This treatment was evaluated during a subsequent intentional degradation under conditions of 75C with an LED white light source at an intensity of 1kW m

@highlight B Ga co doped cast mono Si PERC solar cells were treated in a light soaking tool and a RTP system.
@highlight Properly regenerated samples by light soaking suffered from the lower degradation than the untreated solar cells.
@highlight The performance of the solar cells could be improved by RTP treatment but less stable than the regenerated samples.
@highlight Combining with two processes may be a potential method to provide both the improved performance and low LeTID properties.
