 As a new kind of electronic waste waste solar cells have posed a great threat to the environment . Solar cells contain a mass of hazardous organic components such as ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and polyethylene glycol terephthalate . The degradation of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and polyethylene glycol terephthalate may produce toxic substances to the environment . This paper proposed molecule co fracture to dispose the organics in order to judge the hazard of degradation products to the environment . Co fracture kinetics analysis showed that the heating rate with highest co fracture efficient was 30

@highlight This paper provided a novel method of disposing EVA and PET in waste solar cells.
@highlight No hazardous substance was produced under heating rate at 30
@highlight C min.
@highlight The product differences depended on the different energy supply at different heating rates.
