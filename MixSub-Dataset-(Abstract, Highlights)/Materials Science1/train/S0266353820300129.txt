 Hydrogels with a combination of high mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity are promising for soft and wearable electronics devices . However the trade off between poor strength toughness and high electrical resistance of the hydrogels severely hamper their practical application in diverse areas . In this work we reported a facile and effective strategy for fabricating mechanically robust and electrically conductive nanocomposite hydrogels via incorporating chitosan
