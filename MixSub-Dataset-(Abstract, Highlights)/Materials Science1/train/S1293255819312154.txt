 Synergistic effects of ion exchange and complexation in Cd removal was studied by the modification of nanoparticles of clinoptilolite zeolite by pentetic acid as a family of EDTA . XRD FT IR BET TG DTG and SEM EDX were used for the characterization of the NCP and NCP DTPA . The interactions of solution pH NCP DTPA dosage concentration of cadmium solution and contact time were studied by Response Surface Methodology . The pH adsorbent dosage and pH C

@highlight More efficiency of NCP DTPA for Cd II removal with respect to the raw NCP.
@highlight Synergistic effect of ion exchange and complexation for Cd II removal in the modified sample.
@highlight Involving mono and multi layer adsorption for Cd II removal by the adsorbent.
@highlight More importance of pH C
@highlight and pH adsorbent dose interactions in Cd II removal.
