 Radiative cooling is a passive means of cooling that does not require the consumption of additional energy and has broad application potential . While experimental spectral measurements have been conducted the daylighting of buildings photovoltaic cells and vehicles has seldom been considered . Here we use spectrum selective coatings to resolve the competing demands of daylighting and radiative cooling . A simple liquid blade coating method that was inexpensive convenient and scalable was used to achieve radiative cooling with ultrahigh transmittance in visible light and excellent cooling performance . Resonant polar dielectric SiO
