 Photovoltaic backsheets are exposed to harsh outdoor weathering conditions throughout their service lives that can compromise their protective function through adhesive debonding between their constituent layers and between the backsheet and the module . A large scale study on adhesive degradation was conducted on 37 field exposed modules that spanned 19 different module manufacturers that were deployed among six KppenGeiger climatic zones and that were fielded between 0 and 28 years . Six outer layer polymer classes were identified among the backsheets polyamide polyethylene terephthalate polyvinyl fluoride polyvinylidene fluoride fluoroethylene vinyl ether copolymer and tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene vinylidene fluoride copolymer . Two adhesion tests were used to measure the adhesive strength the wedge test and the width tapered single cantilever beam test . Adhesion energies were compared across exposure time and KppenGeiger climatic zone . Many of the PET PVF and PVDF based backsheets experienced degradation of the adhesive layer between the backsheet outer and core layers . A consistent trend of decreasing adhesion energy with exposure time was observed in five out of the six backsheet types . Trends among adhesion energy and climatic zone while expected were not observed possibly due to broad ranges in temperature humidity and precipitation defining KppenGeiger climatic zones . The cantilever beam measurements produced an upper cutoff of approximately 100J m
