 Graphite crucibles are potentially interesting for the directional solidification processing of photovoltaic silicon because contrarily to standard silica crucibles they can be used many times . In the present work two types of graphite crucibles are studied i graphite directly coated with the Si

@highlight The ingot is successfully released from the crucibles and the crucible is re used several times.
@highlight For SiC graphite crucibles no contribution of the crucible to the contamination of silicon by carbon is observed.
@highlight Graphite crucibles suppress the important source of oxygen contamination coming from silica crucibles.
@highlight No contamination of silicon by electrically active impurities coming SiC graphite crucible is observed.
@highlight Conversion efficiencies of cells from SiC graphite crucible are as good as those from silica crucible.
