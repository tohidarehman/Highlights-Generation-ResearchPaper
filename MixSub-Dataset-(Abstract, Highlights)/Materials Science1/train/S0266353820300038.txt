 Composite phase change materials with excellent light adsorption and high thermal conductivity have great potentials in the efficient solar to thermal energy utilization . In order to improve the light absorption and solar to thermal conversion efficiency reduced graphene oxide nanosheets decorated with CoO nanoparticles

@highlight with CoO nanoparticles is used as support for polyethylene glycol.
@highlight CoO and rGO enhance the light absorption and solar thermal conversion capacity.
@highlight CoO acts as heat transfer intermediate and reduces interface thermal resistance.
@highlight  PEG exhibits enhanced thermal conductivity and shape stability.
