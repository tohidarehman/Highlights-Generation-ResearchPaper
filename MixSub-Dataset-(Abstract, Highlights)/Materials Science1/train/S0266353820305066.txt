 Carbon nanotubes could be an effective additive for polymeric anticorrosion coatings due to their electrical conductivity . For enhancement of the interfacial compatibility and dispersion homogeneity of CNTs in the polymer matrix functionalization of CNTs with matrix polymer is attractive . In this work polybenzoxazine as the matrix polymer is chemically bonded to multiwalled CNT without altering the benzoxazine reactive groups through the radical transfer and addition reaction . The PBz functionalized MWCNT has been carried out with FTIR XPS and Raman spectroscopies . The PBz fraction of PBz MWCNT is also quantitatively and qualitatively observed with thermogravimetric analysis and high resolution TEM respectively . PBz MWCNT has been utilized as an additive for crosslinked PBz based anticorrosion coatings for cold roll steel . An effective protection efficiency of 99.91 with an ultralow corrosion rate of 0.179m y
