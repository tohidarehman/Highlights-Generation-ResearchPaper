 The major obstacles delaying the commercialization of thin film solar cells based on hybrid organic halide perovskite are the expensive materials instability of the devices and the complicated multi step fabrication process . To solve these challenges we present a simple and high material utilization strategy which employing the polyethyleneimine interface abduction to

@highlight Depositing two layers perovskite and hole transportation layer by single step.
@highlight A phase separated strategy for mixed materials with different polarities.
@highlight The process is dozens of times for the cost saving.
@highlight The devices employing phase separated strategy exhibit higher air stability.
