 Thermal storage performance of form stable phase change materials is often compromised by the heavy use of the supporting materials . Here lightweight mesoporous carbon fibers with continuous graphitic walls are prepared by carbonization of polyvinylidene fluoride on magnesium oxide fibers for form stable PCMs . The structure of the MCFs are comprehensively investigated to show their merits for supports of the PCMs . The MCFs are rich in relatively ordered mesopores which can provide effective loading of paraffin and give high thermal storage capacities per unit weight . The paraffin loadings of the as obtained MCF 700 MCF 800 and MCF 900 reach 93 90 and 92wt with maintained shape stability and deliver the thermal storage capacities of 176.54 183.35 and 177.75kJkg

@highlight Lightweight porous carbon fibers were prepared for form stable phase change material.
@highlight High paraffin loadings 90wt within MCFs were obtained for high thermal storage capacities.
@highlight Continuous graphitic walls of the MCFs provided the composite with rapid thermal transfer from outside in.
@highlight The form stable composite was suitable for direct harvesting of solar energy.
