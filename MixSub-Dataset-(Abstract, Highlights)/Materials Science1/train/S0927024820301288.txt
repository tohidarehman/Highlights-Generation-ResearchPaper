 The development of a textile that cools skin both in sunshine and in room can not only protect the human body from a severely hot working environment but also save energy by lowering air conditioner load . Herein we have developed a concept that combines solar energy reflection and passive radiative cooling for strengthening both solar energy blocking and heat dissipation through long wave infrared radiation at wavelengths of 813m . The current technique is achieved by coating a textile with an Al

@highlight A textile modification strategy was proposed to strengthen passive radiative cooling and block solar radiation.
@highlight The modified textile can reduce the temperature of simulated skin by 2.38C in the sunshine.
@highlight The modified textile can avoid the overheating of actual human skin by 0.61.0C in the sunshine.
@highlight The high LWIR long wave infrared emissivity material is proven to be practicable in personal thermal management.
