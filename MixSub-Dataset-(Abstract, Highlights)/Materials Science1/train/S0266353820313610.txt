 Formation of segregated structure in conductive polymer composites is an efficient strategy to achieve high electrical conductivity at relatively low filler loading . Nevertheless not every polymer can meet the requirements for the conventional hot compression molding and it will always result in the weak interfacial bonding among the polymer domains . Herein a clean and energy saving approach based on selective microwave sintering was proposed to fabricate the segregated poly carbon nanotube composites with significantly enhanced electromagnetic interference shielding and mechanical performance . CNT nanoparticles were selectively dispersed and coated on the surface of POE granules under an external force field . The coated CNT layer served as the microwave absorber thus inducing the local melting and welding of the neighboring POE domains without destroying the original CNT segregated network . In this way the intense inter diffusion and entanglement of POE chains occurred in the interface regions to ensure high quality sintering among POE granules . The prepared conductive POE CNT composites were endowed with the significantly enhanced mechanical properties showing nearly 2 times of tensile strength and over 10 times of elongation at break than the samples prepared by hot compaction . Also the SMS composites with only 2.10vol CNT exhibited the excellent electrical conductivity of 26.0S m and EMI SE of 34.7dBat the frequency of 12.0GHz respectively . What s more the sintering process reinforcement mechanism and fusion behavior among neighboring polymer granules were intensively investigated via infrared thermography and COMSOL simulation .
