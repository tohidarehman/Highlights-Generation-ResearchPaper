 The complementary hybridization of nanomaterials enables to realize newly synergistic properties which is a central concept in next generation widespread applications . In particular it is well established that the hybridization of ZnO nanostructure with zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 allows the improvement of gas selectivity owing to molecular sieving capability caused by inherently size defined porous structures of the ZIF 8 . Here we focused on a different viewpoint related with the preconcentration effect of ZIF 8 hybridized with ZnO nanowires array on NO

@highlight The hybridization of ZnO with zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 ZIF 8 was implemented.
@highlight Morphological features of the ZIF 8 encapsulated in the ZnO NWs were optimized.
@highlight The preconcentration and molecular sieving effects of ZIF 8 with ZnO NWs were explored.
