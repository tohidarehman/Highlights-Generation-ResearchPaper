 Nickel oxide and pyrite composites were prepared by impregnation method and employed in the dielectric barrier discharge catalytic removal of gaseous styrene . The properties of the NiO Pyr composites were characterized systematically . The removal efficiencies of styrene and energy yields had been examined as a function of initial concentration of styrene gas flow rates and input powers . The results showed that the NiO Pyr composite had excellent catalytic performance in DBD removal of gaseous styrene while mass ratio of NiO and Pyr was 0.2 and calcined temperature was 500C . When the initial concentration of styrene was 240mgm

@highlight Nickel oxide and pyrite NiO Pyr composites were prepared by impregnation method.
@highlight Dielectric barrier discharge combined with NiO Pyr had excellent synergistic effect.
@highlight DBD NiO Pyr had excellent catalytic performance on styrene degradation.
