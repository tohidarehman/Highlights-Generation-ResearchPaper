 Heavy metal pollution has raised serious concerns due to the potential threat to public health and the environment . Adsorption is an important method for removing metal ions from wastewater but many current adsorbents are limited by high cost low adsorption efficiency and poor cyclability . Herein a compressible composite with a porous structure is prepared by a simple chemical treatment of nanowood with polyethyleneimine . Modification of NW with PEI enables the efficient adsorption of metal ions . PEI NW shows excellent adsorption efficiency . Adsorbed heavy metal ions can be rapidly desorbed by simply immersing PEI NW in a desorption solution . PEI NW can be reused by employing the squeezing method because of its excellent compressibility . The adsorbent can remove the heavy metal ions from polluted water with 60 of adsorption efficiency even after 50 adsorption desorption cycles . This compressible composite provides new insights for the design of efficient cleaners for heavy metal ion removal and offers approaches to the development of functionalization of biomass based composites .
