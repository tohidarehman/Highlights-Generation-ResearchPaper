 Hybrid structures combining a photo active material and non noble metal oxide co catalyst nanoparticles are of strong interest to produce efficient photoelectrodes for hydrogen production while limiting the cost due to noble metals . In order to get some insight on the mechanism change induced by such co catalyst nanoparticles we conducted a comparative study between cobalt and nickel oxide nanoparticles deposited onto TiO

@highlight Reactive Pulse Laser Deposition allows controlled deposition of cobalt and nickel oxide.
@highlight Oxide co catalyst allows to triple the conversion efficiency under solar light.
@highlight Cobalt oxide is photoactive in the visible spectral domain.
@highlight CoO TiO
@highlight heterojunction has an improved charge separation than NiO TiO
