 Due to their enhanced thermophysical properties encapsulated phase change materials have gained attention in solar thermal energy storage applications . In this work we report the encapsulation of an optimized concentration of solar salt 60 40 of NaNO

@highlight Sol gel technique to encapsulate Solar Salt 60 40 of NaNO
@highlight  KNO
@highlight  for solar thermal energy storage.
@highlight The optimized synthesis condition was found to be 24 h of stirring at 600 rpm and a pH between 2.6 and 3.0.
@highlight Thermal conductivity of the encapsulated salt increased by 51 compared to pure salt.
@highlight The reduction in phase change enthalpy was found to be minimum with an encapsulation efficiency of 92.78 .
@highlight Time taken for charging and discharging reduced for the encapsulated salt compared to pure salt.
