 In the present study we report a systematic first principles study which investigates and tunes the percentage of spin polarization in few Co based full Heusler alloys Co

@highlight Co
@highlight CrX X Al Ga In compounds found stable mechanically and dynamically.
@highlight Under Pressure Co
@highlight CrGa undergoes an Electronic Topological Transition ETT .
@highlight This ETT drives the compound Co
@highlight CrGa from metallic to halfmetallic phase.
@highlight The T
@highlight of all the compounds is found to increase under pressure.
@highlight The Spin polarization of all the compounds is found to increase under pressure.
