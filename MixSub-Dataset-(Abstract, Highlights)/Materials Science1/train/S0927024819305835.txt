 The design and synthesis of solar steam generation materials is a green and promising approach to produce freshwater from seawater or contaminated water . Here we develop a highly efficient and stable bilayer evaporator by assembling WO

@highlight A bilayer evaporator by assembling WO
@highlight nanorods onto the wood surface was designed for solar steam generation.
@highlight The solar evaporator has 94.0 solar absorptance.
@highlight The energy conversion efficiency can reach at 82.5 under one sun.
@highlight The evaporator shows great performance toward water evaporation from seawater and contaminated water.
