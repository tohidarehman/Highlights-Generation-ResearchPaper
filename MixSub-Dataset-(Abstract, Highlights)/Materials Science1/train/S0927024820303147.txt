 Silicon solar cells are now less than 3 absolute from the theoretical efficiency limit . Advanced passivated contact architectures have demonstrated surface saturation current densities close to 1fA cm

@highlight Optimized i a Si H layer by controlling the deposition temperature and the silane to hydrogen dilution ratio.
@highlight 40m thin wafers were used as a testbed to increase the sensitivity to the surface passivation.
@highlight Average surface saturation current densities of 0.6 fA cm
@highlight were measured on textured wafers.
@highlight Implied open circuit voltages over 760 mV were accomplished on n type CZ wafers with wafer thicknesses below 50 m.
@highlight We manufactured screen printed silicon heterojunction solar cells on 40 m thick wafers with efficiencies close to 21 .
