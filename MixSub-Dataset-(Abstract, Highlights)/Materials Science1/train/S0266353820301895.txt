 Inspired from a famous Chinese pigskin jelly cuisine flexible and conductive hydrogel was prepared by incorporating 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxy radical oxidized nanocellulose stabilized carbon nanotubes into pigskin matrix in the present study . Due to the assistance of the TC the CNT could homogeneously disperse within the PS and build strong and integrated conductive network . The prepared conductive hydrogel was then used as the flexible conductive sensor for detecting daily human body motion . The supercapacitance properties of the conductive hydrogel was also studied . The results indicated that the TC s CNT PS could quickly and accurately response to the cyclic tensile and pressing forces with stable and repeatable resistance change signals . Moreover the TC s CNT PS was able to detect real time human body motion of different body parts . Besides the prepared hydrogel also had a specific capacitance of 65F g with 60 of the capacitance retention after 2000 consecutive charge discharge cycles . The present study provides a new view to utilize animal food waste for the construction of high performance conductive electrical devices as flexible sensors and supercapacitor electrode .
