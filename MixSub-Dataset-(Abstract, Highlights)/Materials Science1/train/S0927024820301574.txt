 Modeling radiative transfer on a dusty photovoltaic module is a complicated problem . In this work an improved optical light pathway model was established based on a three layer system this system models radiative transfer by considering absorption reflection and transmission . Transmittance and reflectance formulae based on the light transmission and reflection pathway were obtained . Optical experiments were conducted for incident light with a spectral range of 0.300.7m to verify the improved model . The results show that when the thickness of the particle layer was larger than the sum of the minimum and maximum diameters the theoretical spectral transmittance and reflectance agree well with the experimental data . The relative errors of spectrum transmittance and reflectance were 1.1716.79 and 4.1711.68 respectively . Spectral transmittance through the composite layers was very low and the dust particle composition and layer thickness had strong inhibiting effects on the transmission of incident light .

@highlight An improved model was proposed to explain light passing through the dust layer.
@highlight The light energy reduction rate was analyzed along the light propagation path.
@highlight Experiments on dust covered PV module were conducted to verify improved method.
