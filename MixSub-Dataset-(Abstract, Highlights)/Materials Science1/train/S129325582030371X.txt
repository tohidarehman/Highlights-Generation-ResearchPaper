 Zeolite beta with high crystallinity has been successfully synthesized by using kenyaite conversion method with seed crystals under hydrothermal treatment at 125C for 36h . The OSDA free synthesis of zeolite beta could be obtained from the mixture composition of 0.96 NaOH SiO

@highlight High crystalline and pure zeolite beta could be obtained through the conversion of kenyaite by a seed directed OSDA free rount in 36h.
@highlight Changes of medium range structure during the crystallization were investigated.
@highlight The various parameters as reaction temperature time the quantity of beta seeds and gel composition all have very important influence on zeolite beta synthesis.
@highlight The synthesized zeolite beta with relatively high thermal stability exhibits certain catalytic performance in the cyclohexanol dehydration reaction system.
