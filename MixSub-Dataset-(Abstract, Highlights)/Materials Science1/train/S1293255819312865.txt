 The large work function difference between two semiconductors will effectively adjust the interfacial electronic distribution and catalytic performances of heterojunction . In this work a novel

@highlight The carriers mobility and lifetime are adjusted due to the electron redistribution.
@highlight The reduction ability is enhanced and the oxidation active sites is increase.
@highlight The photocatalytic activity is increased by 9.4 and 2.9 times for RhB and TC H degradation under visible light.
