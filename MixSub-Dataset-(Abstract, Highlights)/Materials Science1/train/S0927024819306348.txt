 As building integrated photovoltaics are becoming increasingly popular the demand for optimized utilization will be increasing with respect to efficiency aesthetics and reliability . In cold climate regions we predict that there will also be a growing focus on how to avoid snow and ice formation on the exterior surfaces of BIPV . During the winter period there is substantially less incident solar radiation . This is also the period when the solar radiation is most needed for heating lighting and power production purposes . The task to avoid accretion of snow and ice is challenging due to the fact that snow ice and ambient weather conditions exist in countless variations and combinations . Snowfall freezing of rain water and condensation of air moisture with subsequent freezing are examples of aspects that have to be addressed in a satisfactory way . The present study aims to review the cold weather challenges facing BIPV the strategies for overcoming them and the opportunities that follow from successfully overcoming them .
