 Radiative cooling has gained considerable attention recently mainly due to its spontaneous thermodynamic process of dissipating surplus heat from the terrestrial object to deep space without any external energy . However challenges still remain to meet better the stringent requirement on spectral selectivity for improving the current unoptimized cooling performance especially for the multilayer type radiative coolers . In this work we proposed a radiative cooler with seven layers of SiO

@highlight A multilayer radiative cooler made of a widely available material combination is designed fabricated and characterized systematically.
@highlight The emissivity spectrum possesses a unique spectral selectivity within and beyond the atmospheric window whereas that of many other radiative coolers is non selective in the mid infrared.
@highlight All day radiative cooling is achieved with a maximal temperature drop of 8C even under a hot and humid climate.
