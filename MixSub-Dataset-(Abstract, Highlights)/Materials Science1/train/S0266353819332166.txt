 This work investigates the effect of adding relatively low amounts of graphene nanoplatelets to a biocomposite based on polylactic acid and a lignocellulosic filler achieved by grinding

@highlight Adding GNP improves mechanical properties of green composites.
@highlight A modified Halpin Tsai model fits experimental results at low GNP content.
@highlight Low GNP contents accelerated the degradation of green composites.
@highlight Formulation affects the hydrolysis mechanism.
