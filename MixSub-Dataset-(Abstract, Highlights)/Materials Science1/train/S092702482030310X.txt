 Intense pulsed light is capable of entirely replacing thermal annealing within back end processing of silicon solar cells with passivating contacts . In order to demonstrate this full size silicon heterojunction cells with IPL processed screen printed metal contacts are fabricated . The device with the highest conversion efficiency reaches 23.0 which is confirmed by Fraunhofer ISE CalLab . On average IPL annealed SHJ cells outperform their thermally treated pendants by 0.30.4
