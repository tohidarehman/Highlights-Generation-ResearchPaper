 Molten salt based nanofluids are involved in Thermal Energy Storage Systems both as heat transfer fluids and energy storage materials . Rheological and wetting properties play an acute role in the handling and storage of materials and are closely related with pumping and corrosion issues . In this study the effect of nanoparticle addition on the aforementioned properties of molten salt nanofluids is investigated . The solar salt 60 NaNO

@highlight Both the contact angle and viscosity of the Solar salt are affected by NPs.
@highlight No significant variation is observed in the cases of NaNO
@highlight and KNO
@highlight DSC measurements show that the nanoparticles inhibit the phase transition of the mixture but not the individual salts.
