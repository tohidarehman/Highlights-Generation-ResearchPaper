 In this work one triple cascade structure is proposed as the electron transporting layer for efficient perovskite solar cells . By combining TiO

@highlight A cascade structure of TiO
@highlight  SnO
@highlight  PC
@highlight BM is proposed as the electron transporting layer ETL in perovskite solar cells.
@highlight The perovskite solar cells with cascade ETL exhibit excellent charge extraction and recombination suppressing ability.
@highlight Better performance and reproducibility are obtained by cells with cascade ETLs compared to those with single or bilayer ETLs.
