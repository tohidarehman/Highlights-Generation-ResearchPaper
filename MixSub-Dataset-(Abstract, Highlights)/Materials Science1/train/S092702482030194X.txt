 Efficient solar evaporation requires photothermal conversion materials with broad band absorption in solar spectrum high specific area for water evaporation and sufficient water transport paths . In the current work porous carbonaceous membrane consists of continuous ultrafine carbon fibers was prepared by electrospinning followed by carbonation and oxidation . The carbonaceous membrane can absorb more than 95 of incident solar energy in the range from 250 to 2500nm . The carbonaceous membrane has hydrophilic characteristics and continuous channels for sufficient water transport . The ultrafine carbon fibers on the surface of the membrane provide tremendous interfaces for water evaporation . With localized heating design the carbonaceous membrane delivers a water evaporation rate of 1.33kgm
