 Thin films comprising three dimensional germanium quantum dot lattices formed by nitrogen assisted magnetron sputtering deposition in alumina Al

@highlight Ge quantum dot lattices in oxide matrices usually suffer from Ge oxidation.
@highlight Addition of N during the Ge QD preparation in alumina helps in oxidation reduction.
@highlight The photo induced current in these materials and their quantum efficiency depend on the Ge QD size.
@highlight Multiple exciton generation effect is observed for the film deposited at 500C.
