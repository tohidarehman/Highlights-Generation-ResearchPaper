 Metalorganic frameworks have come up as potential advance materials for energy applications owing to high surface area and tuneable porosity . The poor electrical conductivity and stability of MOFs restrict their vital use in supercapacitor applications . Herein a smart approach was employed to synthesize NiOx nanoparticles decorated with nitrogenous porous carbon
