 In this article we propose a scheme using the conformal coating of p NiOx nanoparticles on the n GaN photoanode to prevent the photoelectrodes from corrosion and thereby enhance conversion efficiency . Furthermore the various weight ratios of NiOx are explored to optimize the study . NiOx nanoparticles avoid corrosion on the n GaN surface decrease the solar water splitting reaction overpotential and enhance the photocurrent density at a working electrode applied bias of 1V in the two electrode system . Finally in the stability test the hydrogen evolution rate of NiOx is more effective than that of pristine n GaN even after 5h . These results indicate that NiOx nanoparticle decorated n GaN gains higher photostability and hydrogen production performance in PEC cells .
