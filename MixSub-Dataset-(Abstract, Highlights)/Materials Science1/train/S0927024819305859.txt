 In this work we investigated the gettering of the in situ phosphorus doped polysilicon passivating contact that was realized through plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technology . Interstitial iron Fe

@highlight In situ doped polysilicon junction prepared by PECVD shows excellent gettering capability.
@highlight Different measures for improving gettering effectiveness are investigated.
@highlight Phosphorus doped polysilicon layer is considered as gettering pool for iron atoms.
@highlight Polysilicon junction prepared by PECVD is able to remove 99.99 Fe
@highlight contamination.
@highlight Champion iV
