 The red shifting absorption of non fullerene acceptor materials is the most important reason for the increasing efficiency of polymer solar cells . However the low absorption of non fullerene materials in the short wave direction and the full width at half maximum of the absorption spectra for active layer materials are only around 100nm which limits the further improvement of power conversion efficiency . Herein we report a novel double cabled material ITLYBT with the same molecular fragments of donor and acceptor moieties . The absorption spectra of ITLYBT are the superimpose of the donor backbones and the acceptor pendants with nearly 200nm blue shift caused by the enhanced steric hindrance which works as an ideal third component for highly efficient ternary PSCs to broaden and complement the absorption spectra of the photoactive layer . By introducing ITLYBT into PBDB T 2F ITIC 4F blend the ternary device shows enhanced

@highlight For the first time the IDT acceptor unit was applied to a double cabled conjugated molecule.
@highlight A novel type double cable polymer synthesized by IDT and BDT unit to complement the low absorption of non fullerene material.
@highlight The ternary blends cell not only improved the short circuit current but also improved the open circuit voltage by 0.05V.
