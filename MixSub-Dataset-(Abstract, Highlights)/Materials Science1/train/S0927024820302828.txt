 Recently the technology of mixing phase change materials with high thermal conductivity fillers was developed which has allowed thermal energy storage to be implemented in a wide range of industrial technologies and processes . In the present study a hierarchical bionic porous nano composite was prepared which efficiently merged the nanomaterial characteristics of magnetism and high thermal conductivity in order to form a magnetically accelerated solar thermal energy storage method . The morphology and thermo physical properties of materials were analysed . The experimental outcomes of phase change heat transfer demonstrated that the maximum storage efficiency increases by 102.7 when the hierarchical bionic porous structure is used and a further 27.1 improvement can be achieved with the magnetic field . At the same time the heat transfer process of energy storage in hierarchical porous composites under external physical fields is explained by simulation . Therefore this magnetically accelerated method demonstrated the superior solar thermal energy storage characteristics within a hierarchical bionic porous structure which is particularly beneficial for the utilisation of solar direct absorption collectors and energy storage technology .
