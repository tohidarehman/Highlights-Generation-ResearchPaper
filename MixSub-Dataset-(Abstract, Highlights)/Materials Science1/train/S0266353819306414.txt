 Construction of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resin composites with excellent mechanical properties and desired flame retardancy is of particular interests for both academia and industry . In this work an interfacial treatment strategy is used to address the above issues instead of adding flame retardants into the composites without additional other flame retardants EP is fire retarded and reinforced only by surficially treated CFs which are fabricated by quickly soaking CFs in aqueous solution of polyelectrolyte complexes consisting of polyethyleneimine and ammonium polyphosphate at room temperature . Both the content and the morphology of the resulting PEC coating are conveniently tuned by adjusting the coating conditions . Without any change in the molding process of the EP CF composites compared with the conventional process the phosphorus containing PEC coating of CF surfaces endows the EP CF composites with high fire retardancy exhibiting a high limiting oxygen index of 43 UL 94 V 0 rating and a 47 reduction in the peak heat release rate from cone calorimetry tests . Moreover the PEC coating greatly improved the interaction between CFs and EP matrix and enhanced the mechanical properties and glass transition temperature of the composite . Therefore this work presents an effective and facile strategy to develop fiber reinforced composites with superior fire retardant and mechanical properties for future massive production .

@highlight The surficial flame retardant coating of CF was achieved by simply soaking in aqueous solution of polyelectrolyte complexes.
@highlight The loading and morphology of CFs flame retardant coatings were easily controlled by altering soaking conditions.
@highlight The surficially treated CF composites showed superb fire retardancy and mechanical properties without any additional flame retardants.
