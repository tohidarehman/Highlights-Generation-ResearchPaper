 Providing a good contact between electroactive materials and their substrates is an important factor for developing supercapacitors . In our work a Graphene cuprous oxide Cu

@highlight Binder free Graphene Cu
@highlight O nanocomposite is fabricated by electrodeposition.
@highlight The nanocomposite acts as both anti corrosion and boosted electroactive material.
@highlight Its specific capacitance is 161.31F gr at 10mVs
@highlight in 6M KOH.
@highlight The synergistic cooperation is responsible for its enhanced capacitive performance.
