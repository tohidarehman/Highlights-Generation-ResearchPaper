 The strength ductility trade off dilemma has inhibited the applications of many structural materials TiAl alloys in particular . Here we report a new insight into the potential for increasing the ductility of Ti

@highlight 3 TiAl 111 incoherent interface plays a dual role during the compression.
@highlight This incoherent interface has a hierarchical atomic structure.
@highlight This incoherent interface bonding characteristics are multiple and inhomogeneous.
@highlight The weakest interface region can act as the nucleation site for primary dislocation.
@highlight The local disordered interface region can act as the sink for secondary dislocation.
