 This work describes an approach to direct evaluate the role of selected modifier added over hematite photoanode interfaces for light assisted water splitting . Hematite photoanodes with thickness varying from 25 up to 130nm were designed via spin coating deposition of polymeric precursor that provides mesoporous planar morphology . The photoelectrochemical data analyzed in terms of global efficiency parameter

@highlight Enhanced efficiency of mesoporous hematite photoanode designed via spin coating deposition of polymeric precursor solution.
@highlight Sn over hematite photoanode enhanced the charge separation however with the cost of creating surface states.
@highlight Ni Fe based materials suppress the surface states by passivation.
@highlight Interfacial engineering revealed the role of different modifiers on catalytic and separation efficiencies.
