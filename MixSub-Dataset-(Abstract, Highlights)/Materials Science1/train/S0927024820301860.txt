 Previous studies have considered the same temperature for all components of the silicon etching solution and the effect of the temperature of the individual components on the etching results has not been explored . In the present study a diamond wire sawn multi crystalline silicon wafer was etched twice for 50s each time . The initial temperature of HF was selected to be room temperature 55 and 66C whereas those of H

@highlight An optimized texture of Si by H

@highlight  HF resulted in cell efficiency of 18.21 .
@highlight partially oxidizes Cu that leaves metal residues and decreases cell efficiency.
@highlight Smaller specific surface area and less metal residues are helpful for raising
