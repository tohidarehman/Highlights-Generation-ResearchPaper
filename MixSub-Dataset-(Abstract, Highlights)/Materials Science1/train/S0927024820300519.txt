 Polysulphide has proven to be an efficient electrolyte for QDSSC but at the cost of corroding the counter electrode and degrading the sensitizer due to its high redox potential . In this view for the first time we have used oxide nanoceramics as low cost easily processable and highly porous solid state electrolytes for QDSSCs . High residual porosity and formation of liquid phase nanodomains across grain boundaries have added advantages for adsorption and diffusion in these hole transport layer . Yttria stabilized zirconia and ceria co doped yttria stabilized zirconia are the two solid state electrolytes designed in place of polysulphide . Dopants namely Y

@highlight Nanoceramics low cost easily processable and highly porous solid state electrolytes for QDSSCs.
@highlight Formation of liquid phase nanodomains across grain boundaries allows better diffusion of electrolyte.
@highlight Ceramics act as barriers or passivation layer to suppress electron recombinations resulting in high stability and Voc.
