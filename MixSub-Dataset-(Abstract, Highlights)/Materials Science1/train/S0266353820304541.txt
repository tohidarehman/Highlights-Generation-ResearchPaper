 Textile based supercapacitors having intrinsically mechanical flexibility are regarded as hopeful power sources for wearable electronics . Herein four PANI graphene textile electrodes are successfully synthesized using a simple dipping and drying procedure followed by

@highlight Densely packed PANI is evenly decorated on the graphene functionalized fabric.
@highlight Ultrahigh areal specific capacitance energy and power densities are realized.
@highlight Great mechanical flexibility and capacitive stability are demonstrated.
@highlight The differences among four dopants are systematically analysed and clarified.
