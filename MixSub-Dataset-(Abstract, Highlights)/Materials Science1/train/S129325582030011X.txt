 The high quality of reduced graphene oxide supported platinum nanoparticles was synthesized by a simple efficient rapid clean surfactant free and single step of hydrothermal assisted formic acid process . The as synthesized rGO PtNPs catalyst was extensively characterized in which demonstrated that the PtNPs have successfully anchored on the surface of rGO with the small average particle size of 4nm . The evaluation of electrocatalytic activity and durability performance of the as synthesized rGO PtNPs nanocomposite catalyst towards methanol oxidation reaction as well as the determination of electrochemical surface area were carried out by cyclic voltammogram and chronoamperometry . Besides the as prepared rGO PtNPs nanocomposite catalyst has further proved the remarkably higher electrocatalytic property which exhibited superior maximum forward peak current density 64.04mA cm
