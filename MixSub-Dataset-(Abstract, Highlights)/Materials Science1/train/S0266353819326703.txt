 Natural biopolymers such as chitosan and cellulose have demonstrated huge potential in important and rapidly growing environmental and biomedical applications . However it is always challenging to create advanced functional biopolymer materials with enhanced hydrolytic stability cost effectively . Here we report an advance in preparing biopolymer polyelectrolyte complexed materials based on chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose using a dry thermo mechanical kneading method . Despite the high hydrophilicity of chitosan and CMC the resulting films showed excellent dimensional stability and structural integrity . In comparison chitosan only films were swollen dramatically under the same conditions with a 138 dimensional expansion and a 913 rise in weight which were also fragile . We propose that our processing method led to polyelectrolyte complexation between chitosan and CMC generating physical crosslinking points in the materials which stabilised the films in water . Interestingly the greater hydrolytic stability of chitosan CMC films is in contrast with their higher surface hydrophilicity a contribution from CMC . Our simple approach to engineering high performance biopolymer materials without resorting to complex chemistries can be envisioned to bring about a new direction in the design of advanced functional materials where sustainability and cost effectiveness are priorities .
