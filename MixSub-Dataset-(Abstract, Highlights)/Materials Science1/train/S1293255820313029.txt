 High energy density and low cost anode materials are essential for lithium ion batteries . Herein we proposed a strategy that combined electrospinning technique with water bath method to prepare a free standing nanorod structured

@highlight composite was prepared by electrospinning technique.
@highlight 3D vertical ZnO nanorod promotes fast redox reaction kinetics.
@highlight Carbon fiber constructs a transportation and diffusion path for electron and Li
@highlight The
@highlight film exhibits good cycling and rate capability for the Li ion batteries.
