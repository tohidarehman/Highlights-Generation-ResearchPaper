 As the soul of cement based materials hydration is a complex process involving many chemical reactions which is one of the intrinsic driving forces for the evolution of the microstructure and macroscopic properties of cementitious composites . The predominant lines of previous researches on cement hydration models are dominated by spherical particles . However the actual shape of cement grains is non spherical . Herein a continuous based hydration model of non spherical cement particles is developed in which the hydration kinetics strongly depend on the morphological features of cement grains . Subsequently the proposed HYD NSP model is validated by experimental results . By applying the HYD NSP model we further investigate the evolution of microstructures of cement paste including icosahedron shaped cement grains over time . Results reveal that the influence of the shape of cement particles on the degree of hydration and the porosity of cement paste is mainly reflected by their specific surface area .
