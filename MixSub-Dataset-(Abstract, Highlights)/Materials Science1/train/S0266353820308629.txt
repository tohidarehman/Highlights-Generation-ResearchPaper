 Carbon materials have extensive applications and research prospects as microwave absorbing materials but their absorbing properties are limited by the lack of magnetic properties . Here a simple grinding method was used to prepare the Co

@highlight Spherical porous composite material can be obtained by directly pyrolysing the physical mixture of ZIF 8 and Co
@highlight The methods of physical grinding and solid pyrolysis are facile for large scale preparation.
@highlight value of 31.53dB with broadband absorption bandwidth of 6.3 GHz was achieved at 2.5 mm.
@highlight Co nanoparticles and micron porous structure accounted for reinforced microwave absorption performance.
