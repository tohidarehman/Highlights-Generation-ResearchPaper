 The dimensions of halide perovskite materials have been tailored for optoelectronic and energy conversion applications . The halide perovskite dimension has reached the ultimate size the molecular state . In this manuscript we employ first principles calculations to understand the dimensional tailoring of halide perovskite materials that combine the molecular state and the three dimensional state focusing on the cesium based Cs
