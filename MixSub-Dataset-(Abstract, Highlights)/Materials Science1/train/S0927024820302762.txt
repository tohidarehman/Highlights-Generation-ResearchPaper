 Molten chlorides are promising heat transfer fluids and thermal energy storage materials for third generation concentrated solar power plants . Despite their low cost and wide operating temperature ranges structural materials experience severe corrosion in commercially available chloride salts . The understanding of the corrosion mechanisms is therefore critical for successful plant design to ensure constant power generation over the 30 years of expected lifetime . This work investigates the corrosion behavior of ferritic martensitic P91 steel and Inconel 600 nickel based alloy in molten NaCl KCl MgCl
