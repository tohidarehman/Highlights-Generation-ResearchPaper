 Electrochromic energy storage devices that possess characteristics of energy storage and electrochromism are highly desirable and have increasingly attracted research interests whilst devices that can be stretched or are flexible have received very little attention . Herein we report a flexible and rechargeable aluminium ion EC battery which consists of a WO
