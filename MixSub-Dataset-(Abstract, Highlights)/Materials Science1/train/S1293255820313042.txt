 Photodegradation has been taken as a promising technology in solving global environmental pollution . In this paper the flower like hierarchical architecture of BiOI ZnO

@highlight Flower like hierarchical architectures of BiOI ZnO were synthesized.
@highlight p n junction between p type BiOI and n type ZnO was constructed.
@highlight The formation of p n junction fascinated the separation of photogenerated carriers.
@highlight BiOI ZnO composites showed remarkable visible light photodegrading activities.
