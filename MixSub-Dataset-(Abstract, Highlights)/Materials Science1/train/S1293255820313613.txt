 It is reported that two compounds containing several rare earth elements simultaneously was obtained recently . It is proposed to call them polyelement solid solutions . Single crystals of RE hexaborides and RE digallides PSS were obtained some of their characteristics and features are given . These PSS were obtained by mass crystallization from melts solutions in Al and Ga . PSS hexaborides exhibit a densification of their crystal structure when RE atoms are introduced into the base LaB6 crystal lattice . The incorporation is facilitated by the presence of a homogeneity region in RE hexaborides and RE digallides . The stepwise chemical analysis of the recently obtained 6 element PSS of lanthanum hexaborides and digallides shows a high uniformity of the RE distribution along the sample . The complex process of the formation of PSS of hexaborides RE and digallides of RE is analyzed and the possibility of obtaining different groups of PSS is discussed .

@highlight Polyelement solid solutions of RE hexaborides and RE dihallides have been obtained and investigated.
@highlight An excellent homogeneity of RE distribution in 6 element hexaboride LnB
@highlight was determined.
@highlight The compaction of the crystal structure of polyelement LnB
@highlight solid solutions was established.
@highlight The microhardness of polyelement LnB
@highlight solid solutions was increased markedly.
