 Gallium phosphide is an important material in terms of III V semiconductors integration on Si . In this work we study photovoltaic properties of GaP Be GaNP E

@highlight For the first time MBE grown GaNP based solar cell on Si is fabricated.
@highlight The fabricated device is thoroughly characterized with IV DLTS and EBIC measurements.
@highlight Theoretical model of the device is introduced to find out prospects for future development of the photovoltaic devices of the proposed design.
