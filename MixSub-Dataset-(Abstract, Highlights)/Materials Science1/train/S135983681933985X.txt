 Extrusion processing and properties of fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites may be influenced by the fiber feeding route upon extrusion . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of fiber feeding route on the fiber length distribution electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness tensile and flexural properties and heat deflection temperature of resulting composites with different fiber contents . HNiCF polypropylene and SNiCF polypropylene pellets were produced through two different feeding routes of nickel coated carbon fiber hopper feeding and side feeding upon extrusion process respectively . NiCF reinforced polypropylene composites were fabricated by means of compression molding using each pellet respectively . The effect of fiber feeding route on the electromagnetic mechanical and thermal properties of the composites with various NiCF contents was studied . SNiCF PP composites exhibited the EMI SE tensile and flexural properties and heat deflection temperature higher than HNiCF PP composites . The improved properties of SNiCF PP composites were ascribed to higher aspect ratio and longer fiber distribution of NiCF remaining in the composite than HNiCF PP counterparts due to less shearing and fiber damages during extrusion .
