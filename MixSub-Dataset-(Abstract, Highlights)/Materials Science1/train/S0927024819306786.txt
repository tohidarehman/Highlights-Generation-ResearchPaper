 Lead halide perovskite solar cells have potential toward commercialization because of their high efficiency and low cost . The hole transport layer of p i n perovskite solar cell is usually made of NiO

@highlight We developed a facile method to obtain high quality NiOx films annealed by NIR in a short time of 50s.
@highlight The PVSCs fabricated from NIR NiOx film show a comparable PCE to those fabricated from traditional HP NiOx.
@highlight The NIR NiOX film is replaced by NIR Co NiOX film to further improve the PCE of PVSCs from 15.99 to 17.77 ..
