 It is well known that the quality of contact passivation can greatly influence the efficiency of Si solar cells . In this work the impact of annealing a wet chemically formed silicon oxide SiO

@highlight Impact of annealing wet chemical SiO
@highlight prior to n poly Si deposition is studied at varying temperatures 425900C .
@highlight Improvement in passivation quality along with increase in thickness is observed upon annealing at high temperatures in air and forming gas.
@highlight Lower values of contact resistivity were measured indicating pinhole formation at higher temperatures.
@highlight Best SiO
@highlight  n
@highlight poly Si passivated contact showed low recombination current density 4.2fAcm
@highlight  and contact resistivity 0.27cm
@highlight  .
@highlight This annealing optimization of SiO
@highlight resulted in 1.2 efficiency improvement compared to the non annealed reference samples.
