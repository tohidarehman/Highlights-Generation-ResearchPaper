 In contrast to commonly adopted harmful reagents which are not favorable for human body and environment a facile environmental friendly dedoping approach is proposed to modulate carrier transport and thermoelectric properties of single walled carbon nanotube polyaniline composites by ethanol treatment . Compared with the pristine composite films PANI is partially dedoped after treatments which results in typically increasing of Seebeck coefficient and deteriorative electrical conductivity . As the interconnected conductive CNT networks provide extra pathways to facilitate carrier transport the electrical conductivity is only slightly decreased . Consequently an enhanced power factor of 362Wm
