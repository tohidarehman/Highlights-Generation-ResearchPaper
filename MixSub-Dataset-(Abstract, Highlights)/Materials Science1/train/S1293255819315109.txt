 Two Schiff bases 4 methylidene amino 1 5 dimethyl 2 phenyl 1 2 dihydro 3H pyrazol 3 one and 4 amino 1 5 dimethyl 2 phenyl 1 2 dihydro 3H pyrazol 3 one derived from 4 aminoantipyrine are reported . The compounds were recrystallized in methanol and characterized using spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X ray diffraction analysis . The XRD structure shows that APNA and SBAP crystallize respectively in the orthorhombic and monoclinic crystal systems space groups of

@highlight The crystal systems and space groups obtained from the crystals gave APNA orthorhombic 
@highlight 2 1 and SBAP monoclinic C2 c .
@highlight Additional hydroxyl group in SBAP raised the TPSA more than APNA which had more aromatic ring.
@highlight The biological activity of the compounds against the tested bacterial is moderate.
@highlight The compounds were able to cleave DNA.
