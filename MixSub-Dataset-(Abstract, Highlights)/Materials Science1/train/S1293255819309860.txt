 High temperature high pressure conditions were used to insert liquid bismuth in 46nm diameter amorphous silica nanotubes . A combination of transmission electron microscopy and neutron powder diffraction indicate that the final composite consists in 56nm semi conducting Bi nanowires confined in insulating mesoporous quartz . Such a nanostructured material could be of considerable interest for thermoelectric applications .

@highlight Bismuth was inserted into 46nm silica nanotubes under high pressure high temperature conditions.
@highlight The host amorphous nanotubes crystallize in the form of quartz.
@highlight The obtained nanocomposite consists of 56nm Bi nanowires imbedded in mesoporous quartz.
@highlight The formation of Bi nanowires modifies their physical properties compared to bulk Bi.
