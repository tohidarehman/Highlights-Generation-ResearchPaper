 The present research aimed to investigate tin selenide nanoparticles films and study effects of indium dopant on their physical properties . The X ray diffraction pattern results confirmed the formation of polycrystalline nature of orthorhombic SnSe . Also addition of In dopant reduced the size of crystallite and increased the amount of strain in the crystalline lattice . Field emission scanning electron microscopy images showed nanostructures in the form of spherical shapes in nano dimensions on surface of film . Optical studies also indicated the band gap energy in an appropriate range for absorbing sunlight rays . The electrical characteristics indicated an improvement in the electrical conductivity of doped samples compared to the un doped sample so that the solar cell efficiency was obtained at 0.36 for the sample with the highest dopant concentrations . The role of In ions was investigated on the photovoltaic properties of samples by examining physical properties .
