 Laser doped boron selective emitters are an ideal candidate for enabling less emitter recombination lower contact resistance and better blue response of efficient n type silicon solar cells . However the low boron concentration of the borosilicate glasses formed during boron diffusion processes and the implementation of ultraviolet lasers have hindered the commercialization of laser doped boron selective emitters . In this contribution separate BBr

@highlight diffusion processes for green laser doped selective emitters were developed based on the higher boron dose BSG grown during BSG deposition and B driving in.
@highlight Green laser and boron diffusion furnace in the fabrication of industrial PERC and n Si solar cell respectively were used instead of expensive ultraviolet laser and other complex boron resources.
