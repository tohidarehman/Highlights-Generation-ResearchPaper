 Planar structure perovskite solar cells have attracted more and more attention because their simple and low temperature preparation processing . However the performance of perovskite solar cells is currently limited by defect induced recombination at interfaces between perovskite and charge transport layers . In this work a filmy poly methyl methacrylate layer introduced in Perovskite Spiro OMeTAD interface to passivate the interfacial and interganular defects by which a high open circuit voltage is acquired and the optimal device shows a steady state power conversion efficiency of 20.5 and negligible hysteresis . Femtosecond transient absorption measurement confirms a significant reduction in non radiative recombination for passivated devices . Mott Schottky measurement indicates improved flat band potential and carrier density in passivated devices consisting with the increased voltage . In addition PMMA film can protect perovskite film from moisture and oxygen erosion . The unsealed device still maintains 95 of the initial efficiency under ambient conditions with 60 relative humidity for one month . This approach solves one of the main limitations of interfacial recombination and shows its potential to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells in the future .

@highlight An ultrathin polymer film is used to passivate the interfacial and intergranular defects in PSCs.
