 Different from the opaque conventional types transparent solar cells have the great advantage of generating energy without blocking of human vision . And thus this invisible power generator can be applied to cell phone screens displays and windows of vehicles and buildings . The electric power conversion from UV absorption spontaneously removes the UV induced damage on skin and eyes .

@highlight All inorganic transparent photovoltaic cell is realized by p NiO n TiO
@highlight heterostruture.
@highlight Intermediate formation of Ti
@highlight formation absorbs the longer wavelength light.
@highlight Self doped TiO
@highlight  NiO transparent solar cell is stable more than 30 days.
@highlight Transparent solar cell moves a fan 0.3V and 2.5mA under LED light.
