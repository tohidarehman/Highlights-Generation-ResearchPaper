 The rapid development of optoelectronic devices puts forward higher requirements for flexible transparent films with good mechanical and thermal properties . To further improve the mechanical thermal and optical properties of the PVA co PE nanofiber reinforced epoxy composite film cellulose nanocrystals was selected as modifier to enhance the interfacial adhesion between the reinforced nanofibers and matrix . Benefiting from excellent hydrophily high strength transparency and ultra low thermal expansion coefficient of CNCs dramatic improvements in tensile strength transparency and thermal stability of CNCs PVA co PE epoxy composites were observed over pure PVA co PE nanofiber epoxy film . Typically when the CNCs concentration was 3 the transparency of CNCs PVA co PE epoxy film increased from 83.4 to 90.4 the tensile strength increased from 11.4MPa to 16.4MPa the CTE dropped from 33 to 10ppm K. Furthermore as the reinforcement for matrix and the carrier for functional materials the CNCs PVA co PE nanofiber membrane was used to prepare the patterned photochromic and thermochromic films encapsulated with epoxy indicating the potential application of CNCs PVA co PE epoxy composites in the light emitting devices .

@highlight The transparent CNCs PVA co PE epoxy film with enhanced mechanical and thermal properties was prepared.
@highlight The interfacial adhesion between the PVA co PE nanofibers and epoxy matrix was enhanced by introduction of CNCs.
@highlight The CNCs PVA co PE NM is not only the reinforcement for matrix but also the carrier for functional materials.
@highlight The photochromic and thermochromic films with repeatable color change properties were prepared.
