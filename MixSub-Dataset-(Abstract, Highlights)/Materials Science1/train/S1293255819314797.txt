 Two mesoporous ordered silica with MCM 41 pores arrangement were synthesized and surface modified by a post synthetic treatment . The first composite has aminopropyl functionalities while the other features aminopropyl and methyl surface groups . Both composites were used as sorbents for Cr removal from aqueous media at pH 2 . In order to test the stability and durability of the sorbents the samples were subjected to alkaline extreme conditions at different times and after that tested again for Cr removal . The bi functionalized MCM 41 retains its Cr elimination capacity unchanged after 16h of alkaline treatment while the aminopropyl MCM 41 sample suffer a drop of about 30 . The fresh and alkaline treated samples were characterized by X ray diffraction at low angles nitrogen sorption at 77K Fourier transform infrared Thermal analysis . The presence of the methyl moieties increases the hydrophobicity of the composite s surface which inhibit the approaching of the water molecules avoiding the hydrolysis of SiOSi bonds of the MCM 41 pores walls . Besides this protective effect is reflected in the textural properties changes before and after alkaline treatments while the specific surface area of aminopropyl MCM 41 goes from an initial value of 793 to 495m

@highlight Aminopropyl functionalized MCM 41 is able to reduce Cr VI .
@highlight Aminopropyl methyl functionalized MCM 41 is not able to reduce Cr VI .
@highlight The presence of the methyl moieties increases the hydrophobicity of the MCM 41 composite s surface.
@highlight The non polar heads of the methyl functionalizing group improve the MCM 41 composite stability.
