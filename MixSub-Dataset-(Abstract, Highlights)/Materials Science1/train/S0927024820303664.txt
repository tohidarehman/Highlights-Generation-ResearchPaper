 Thin films of electrochromic W oxide were prepared by reactive DC magnetron sputtering and were immersed in electrolytes of LiClO

@highlight Potentiostatic rejuvenation of electrochromic WO
@highlight thin films was studied.
@highlight Films were immersed in electrolytes of LiPC with 0.53.0wt of added polyethylene oxide.
@highlight Film degradation was investigated in potential ranges of 1.54.0 and 2.04.0V
@highlight Li Li
@highlight The addition of PEO led to significant improvements of stability in the potential range 1.54.0V.
@highlight Optical properties after rejuvenation are best for PEO concentrations in the range 1.52.5wt .
