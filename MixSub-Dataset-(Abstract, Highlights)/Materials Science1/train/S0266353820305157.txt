 Recently anisotropic polymer ceramic composites have attracted great attention because of their high thermal conductivity for the extensive usage in microelectronic devices . However further enhancement of their thermal conductivity is a great challenge due to the presence of interface thermal resistance and lack of efficient heat conduction pathways . Herein epoxy aluminum nitride honeycomb composites were fabricated through a two step method including freeze casting of the AlNH reinforcements and EP infiltration . The results showed that the vertically aligned and interconnected thermal conductive networks contributed to the enhanced thermal conductivity and thermal stability of the composites with the increase in AlN loading . The composites exhibited maximal thermal conductivity values of 9.48Wm
