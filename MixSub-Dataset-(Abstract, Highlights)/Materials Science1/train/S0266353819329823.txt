 Bio inspired self healing polymer foams containing novel calcium alginate capsule system was developed for load bearing application . The capsules were created by a multi stage encapsulating process that can encapsulate two mutually reactive healing agents within single capsules . The capsules had a bilayered structure with the epoxy resin encapsulated within the inner layer and the hardener within the outer layer . To evaluate the mechanical self healing performance the following tests were conducted i.e . cyclic quasi static compression tests for foams quasi static three point bending tests for foam core sandwich beams and high speed soft impact tests for foam core sandwich beams . Cyclic quasi static compression tests demonstrated bilayered capsule systems had better multiple self healing effect compared to the dual capsule system without external interventions and bilayered capsules could enhance the stiffness and strength of foams . For foam core sandwich beams the bilayered capsules did not have a noticeable effect on the effective stiffness of the beams however it could provide a noticeable selfhealing effect when the damage occurred . The images obtained from scanning electron microscope and X ray microcomputed tomography suggested that the micro cracks induced by the static and impact loading were either fully or partially healed by the released healing agents without external interventions .
