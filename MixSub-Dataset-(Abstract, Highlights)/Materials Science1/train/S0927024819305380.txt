 Fiber shaped Dye Sensitized Solar Cells represent one of the most interesting technologies aimed at the light harvesting and the production of electricity for wearable applications . In order to boost DSSFs commercialization their production costs and environmental impact must be reduced . To this end a suitable strategy could be to build thin film based devices endowed with metal free organic sensitizers exploiting their higher molar extinction coefficients compared to typical ruthenium containing organometallic dyes . In this work three thiazolo 5 4
