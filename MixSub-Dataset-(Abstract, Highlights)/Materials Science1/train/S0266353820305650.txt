 Synthesis of bulk superhydrophobic composite materials with durable and repairable properties is of important theoretical and practical significance . Herein a bulk superhydrophobic composite film is fabricated by integrating organic polymer components polyurethane acrylate and polydimethylsiloxane and inorganic component silica particles SiO

@highlight A composite film based on polyurethane polysiloxane and silica is proposed.
@highlight The composite film exhibits a bulk superhydrophobic state.
@highlight The composite film possesses high damage insensitive behavior.
@highlight The superhydrophobic film presents repairable ability via sanding treatment.
@highlight The aquatic show is successfully realized for the first time.
