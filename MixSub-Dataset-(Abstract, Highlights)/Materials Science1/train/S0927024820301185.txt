 Slurry iron aluminide coatings deposited by spraying on 9wt Cr P91 alloy as well as uncoated P91 were exposed isothermally at 650C to a ternary molten salt mixture based on a Na K and Li carbonate eutectic under static and dynamic conditions . Uncoated P91 evidenced considerable mass gains and extensive spallation in both conditions . Indeed P91 developed a very thick fast growing multilayered oxide scale which included LiFeO

@highlight Corrosion of P91 by molten carbonates at 650C takes place at very fast rates.
@highlight Dynamic conditions lead to higher corrosion degradation of coated and uncoated samples.
@highlight Non uniform corrosion takes place on FeAl coated systems.
@highlight Mn from the substrate reaches the corrosion scale surface on coated and uncoated P91.
