 Thin film solar cells have attracted increasing attention due to its low material cost and large flexibility but they also face the challenge of low solar absorption due to reduced active layer thickness . Through exciting surface plasmon resonance plasmonic metal nanoparticles are usually placed on the cell front surface to enhance solar absorption . However if eliminating the unuseful intrinsic absorption in nanoparticles we find that dielectric ones are better choices to enhance a Si thin film solar cell absorption efficiency . Moreover a composite light trapping structure with dielectric nanoparticles on the front surface and metal hemispheres on the rear surface is proposed to achieve broadband absorption enhancement in both short and long wavelengths with the aim to get a higher conversion efficiency . The finite difference time domain simulation results show that compared with bare 100 nm thick amorphous silicon solar cell the short circuit current density and photoelectric conversion efficiency could be respectively improved by 21 and 18 with addition of optimized composite light trapping structure . The general method proposed in this study could provide valuable guidance to light trapping structure design for various kinds of thin film solar cells .
