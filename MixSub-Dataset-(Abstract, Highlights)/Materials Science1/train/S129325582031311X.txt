 Fine grained boron carbide and metal boride composites are known for their superhardness which is used in many industrial technologies . The introduction of binder components in free metallic state and or additional ceramic components can further improve the material mechanical properties by making it more dispersive . A new chemical method is proposed for the synthesis of the fine grained powder complex composites boron carbidetitanium diboridetungsten boridecobalt B
