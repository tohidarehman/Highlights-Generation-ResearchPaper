 Graphene oxide nanosheets were employed as the additive to make composites of erythritol a promising medium temperature PCM candidate . GO nanosheets modified with hydroxyl groups were applied to improve the dispersion stability of the composites . A systematic characterization on the latent heat storage performance was performed for both pure and composite erythritol in order to identify the benefits and challenges of the composites . It was found that the thermal conductivity is increased by nearly twice and the degree of supercooling was lowered from 64C to 48C at the loading of 1.0wt GO nanosheets . The addition of GO nanosheets also leads to an increase of the retrievable latent heat during crystallization from 187kJ kg to 225kJ kg at the same loading by increasing the crystallinity . However the introduction of GO nanosheets can also lead to a rise in the dynamic viscosity of erythritol . As a result the crystallization rate is slowed down and accordingly the duration of crystallization becomes 62 longer when the loading reaches 1.0wt . In addition favorable dispersion stability of the erythritol composites is observed and their melting point remains almost unchanged during 50 melting crystallization cycles . Functionalized GO nanosheets have been shown to be an efficient additive for improving the performance of erythritol but a trade off analysis on the loading would be required to achieve the best overall performance .
