 Environmental economics is accelerating the urgency to develop recycling technologies for the ever growing quantity of discarded carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites . Herein an imine containing epoxy hardener was synthesized by condensation of lignin derived vanillin and methylcyclohexanediamine . The epoxy resin cured by ICH has sufficient glass transition temperature tensile strength and solvent resistance . The incorporated dynamic imine bonds allow the epoxy resin to be reprocessable and degradable . The reprocessed resin has slightly increased glass transition temperature

@highlight An imine containing epoxy resin with high performance and versatile recyclability.
@highlight The recycled epoxy resins show high performance retention rate.
@highlight Closed loop recycling of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites.
