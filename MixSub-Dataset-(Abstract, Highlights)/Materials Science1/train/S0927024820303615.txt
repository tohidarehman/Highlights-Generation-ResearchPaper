 The performance of OPV module is strongly dominated by the innovating materials and state of the art processes . Herein we present a large area and solution processable OPV module which the non fullerene based active layer and interlayers are all deposited by blade coating . The module achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.5 under 100mW cm

@highlight OPV module with a power conversion efficiency of 9.5 is demonstrated.
@highlight The module is fabricated on a 30 cm by 20 cm substrate.
@highlight The result shows a feasibility in the fabrication of large scale modules with excellent performance.
