 A novel hybrid nanocomposite made of cellulose matrix and pumice volcanic rock as a nature basis is presented . This heterogeneous nanocomposite is has also been applied as a suitable biodegradable catalytic system for facilitating the organic reactions . In this work firstly we try to perform well characterization on the prepared cellulose pumice nanocomposite . Further the catalytic activity of cellulose pumice nanocomposite is investigated in the synthesis reactions of 1 4 dihydropyridine derivatives . Moreover the role of ultrasound wave irradiation using an ultrasound bath with 60KHz and 150WL

@highlight A novel nature based catalytic system is presented.
