 A biomimetic diodon skin nanothorn epoxy resin antireflection film was presented to reduce the incident reflection loss of Si solar cell and thus improve power conversion efficiency . The fabricated epoxy resin DSNT film designed using finite difference time domain method was added on bare Si substrate using a polydimethylsiloxane stamps with soft imprint lithography . Optical characteristics showed the reflection was reduced in wavelength range of 3001100nm from 40.0 of bare Si substrate to 15.8 of epoxy resin DSNT film Si substrate . In addition we found the designed DSNT structure can be facilely transferred onto any flat substrates without deformation into unexpected shapes using soft imprint lithography . Moreover the epoxy resin DSNT film exhibited superior hydrophobic and self cleaning properties . By introducing the epoxy resin DSNT film on top of Si solar cell the reflection loss of the Si solar cell was reduced by 7.8 and thus the PCE was increased from 18.99 to 19.88 . Thus the epoxy resin DSNT film is a good candidate of AR film for photovoltaic application .

@highlight A biomimetic diodon skin nanothorn DSNT epoxy resin antireflective coating were designed using finite difference time domain FDTD method and prepared using non contact direct write UV laser photolithography together with two imprint lithographies.
@highlight Experimental results and theoretical simulations consistently showed the biomimetic DSNT structure can reduce the incident reflection of Si solar cell and thus improve power conversion efficiency.
@highlight The biomimetic DSNT epoxy resin antireflective coating can enhance self cleaning capability of solar cells.
