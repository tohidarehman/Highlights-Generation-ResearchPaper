 In this study describes the in situ pyrolytic synthesis of zinc stannate graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite material and its potential application in electrochemical sensing of nitrobenzene . The ZSO gCN nanocomposite was characterized by X ray diffraction fourier transform infra red X ray photoelectron spectroscopy high resolution transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping to determine the crystalline morphology and functionalities of the resultant nanocomposite material . The ZSO gCN was used to modify the glassy carbon electrode surface and investigated for electrochemical determination of nitrobenzene . The ZSO gCN modified GCE showed good electrocatalytic activity towards nitrobenzene than other modified electrodes . The ZSO gCN GCE having the electron transfer rate constant k
