 Highly ductile and wet durable bio composites from keratin reinforced by chitin nanoparticles with engineered deacetylation have been developed . Though featuring good biodegradability and biocompatibility poultry feather extracted keratin based composites usually suffered from poor ductility and moisture stabilities because of poor interfacial properties limited recovery of ordered protein structures and crosslinkages . In this work chitin nanoparticles with engineered deacetylation were used to reinforce keratin . Via engineered deacetylation chitin nanoparticles not only improved interfacial interactions but also formed crosslinkages with keratin . As a result ordered keratin structures with high degree of entanglement in composites were substantially formed without addition of any coupling agents . Furthermore engineered deacetylation for chitin could adjust the wet performance of composites via control of hydrophilicity of matrix and reinforcements . Via control of regularity and hydrophilicity of molecules by chitin nanoparticles mechanical properties and wet performance of keratin based composites can be substantially improved . Reinforced keratin composites had a 230 260 540 increase in breaking strain breaking stress and ductility respectively as well as 94 weight retention after immersed in water for 1 week .
