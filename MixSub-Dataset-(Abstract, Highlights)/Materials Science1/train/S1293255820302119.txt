 In the present study a novel hexagonal mesoporous silica functionalized by nitrilotriacetic acid anhydride and 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane was synthesized NH

@highlight NH
@highlight  HMS NTAA adsorbent was synthesized for BSA adsorption.
@highlight NH
@highlight  HMS NTAA with NH
@highlight and OH groups showed high adsorption capacity via electrostatic and hydrogen binding interactions..
@highlight Maximum adsorption capacity was 1000mg g.
@highlight Langmuir isotherm was the predominant model with mono layer adsorption.
@highlight Adsorption was spontaneous exothermic physical and follows pseudo second order kinetic.
