 Based on crystal chemistry rationale and calculations within the density functional theory DFT the U B system is complemented with additional binary compounds UB

@highlight Completing the U B system with new phases from DFT.
@highlight Hexagonal 2D to 3D boron networks crossover.
@highlight Magnetic 2D UB3 and 3D UB6 with different M V behaviors.
