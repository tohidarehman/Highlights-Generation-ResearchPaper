 A vital part of poly Si passivating contacts is the ultrathin interfacial oxide layer sandwiched between heavily doped poly Si and c Si absorber that will herein be investigated in detail . The stoichiometry of differently prepared interfacial oxides in the as grown state was investigated by XPS . The findings are correlated with the thermal stability of the oxide layers integrated in tunnel oxide passivating contacts which experience further structural modification during the high temperature annealing step . More specifically it was observed that a more stoichiometric interfacial oxide is a more effective diffusion barrier for dopants and thereby enhanced the thermal stability of TOPCon structures with respect to the passivation quality . Furthermore stoichiometric changes in the oxide layer upon subsequent contact formation were analyzed by XPS after selective etch back of the doped poly Si layer . It is found that the interfacial oxide becomes more stoichiometric during annealing . In addition a slight increase in oxide thickness was observed which tentatively could be explained by a large amount of unbound interstitial oxygen in the interface region .
