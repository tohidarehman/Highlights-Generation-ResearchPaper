 A new application of the differential junction photovoltage measurement technique is introduced . The technique s capability to determine the sheet resistance of charge carriers in inversion layers

@highlight Differential JPV measurement is proven to provide contactless and reliable determination of sheet resistance of inversion charge carriers within 1s.
@highlight Differential JPV technique detects and qualifies inversion layers induced by fixed charges within SiN
@highlight and AlO
@highlight layers.
@highlight Accurate sheet resistance test method for cell concepts utilizing inversion layers e.g. inversion layer solar cells applicable even in production lines.
@highlight Differential JPV combined with corona charging provides the contactless mobility measurement of inversion charge carriers without test device fabrication.
@highlight Contactless mobility results feature high sensitivity to interface quality and surface morphology but not influenced by fixed charges.
