 The localized surface plasmon resonance is considered as one of the effective strategies to broaden the spectral absorption range and improve quantum conversion efficiency or photocatalyst . Because of low cost and LSPR absorption peaks in the visible light region Cu based plasmonic photocatalysts have attracted concern in recent years . However the mechanisms of generation modulation and application of LSPR effects of Cu nanoparticles are still insufficient . To this regard by using finite difference time domain simulations and density functional theory calculations the intrinsic mechanism of LSPR in the system of Cu nanosphere loaded onto TiO

@highlight Variations of LSPR effects of Cu NSs was investigated by theoretical calculations.
@highlight Generation and modulation of LSPR of Cu TiO
@highlight NS was discussed in details.
@highlight Configurations of Cu TiO
@highlight NS can predominantly impact LSPR effects of Cu NS.
@highlight Embedding configuration of Cu TiO
@highlight NS maybe has better photocatalytic performance.
