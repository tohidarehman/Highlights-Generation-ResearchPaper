 In this paper an extensive experimental study was performed to quantify and understand secondary bending in multi bolt single lap joints composed of quasi isotropic and cross ply carbon epoxy laminates for two laminate thicknesses . The out of plane displacement which represents SB was measured experimentally using a 3D digital image correlation system . The SB ratio was quantified as the ratio of out of plane displacement

@highlight Secondary bending in three bolt single lap composite joints was investigated via DIC.
@highlight Secondary bending builds up in the early loading stage and generate interlaminar stresses.
@highlight Secondary bending ratio is 30 higher in joints with cross ply than with quasi isotropic laminates.
@highlight Higher secondary bending ratio in joints with cross play laminates contributes to their increased weakness.
@highlight Out of plane displacement increases with the laminate thickness.
