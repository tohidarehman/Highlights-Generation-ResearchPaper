 Magnesium zinc oxide is a promising front contact material for CdTe solar cells . Due to its higher band gap than traditional CdS MZO can reduce parasitic absorption to significantly increase short circuit current density while also providing a benefit of conduction band offset tuning through Mg Zn ratio optimization . MZO has been successfully implemented into CdTe devices however its stability has been of concern . The MZO stability issue has been attributed to the presence of oxygen in the CdTe device processing ambient leading to double diode behavior in the current density voltage curves . Here we report on MZO thin films deposited by reactive co sputtering . The reactively co sputtered MZO thin films have encouraging stability show no significant variation in work function of the surface over a period of 6 months as measured by Kelvin probe . Energy conversion efficiencies of around 16 have been achieved both with and without presence of oxygen in device processing ambients across multiple research facilities . These efficiencies should be possible to increase further by tuning of the thin film deposition and device processing parameters especially through optimization of the back contact .
