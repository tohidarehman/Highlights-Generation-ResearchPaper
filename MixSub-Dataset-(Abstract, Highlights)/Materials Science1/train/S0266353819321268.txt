 Natural silk nanofibers have been attracted more attentions in flexible functional devices and biomaterials . However its mass production and complex fabrication process remains challenging . In this study we successfully developed a new physical chemical strategy to fabricate natural SNFs with high yield . The natural SNFs performed an excellent dispersion in aqueous solution with uniform diameter and 1030m length . The high flexible natural SNFs single wall carbon nanotube composite films were prepared to evaluate their potential in electronic devices . The composite films exhibited remarkable dimensional stability chemical durability and Young s modulus . Furtherly the composite films also presented excellent electrical heating properties and potential utilities in electronics . These natural SNFs CNTs composite films with high mechanical and electrical features offer new starting materials for bioelectronics devices applications such as conductive wire electronical heater and capacitor .
