 Praseodymium and dysprosium isonicotinamide complexes grafted onto modified mesoporous MCM 41 with 3 chloropropyltriethoxysilane as two novel catalysts were synthesized . The catalysts were determined using SEM Mapping EDX FT IR TGA XRD ICP and BET analysis . The catalysts were further studied for the oxidation reaction of sulfur containing compounds . Catalytic results displayed that the MCM 41 INA Pr and MCM 41 INA Dy show high effectiveness for promoting the oxidation reaction of sulfur containing compounds . The catalysts could be recycled for seven runs with negligible destruction of catalytic performance .

@highlight Two novel and eco friendly MCM 41 INA Pr and MCM 41 INA Dy catalysts were prepared and characterized.
@highlight These catalysts can be used for oxidation of sulfides and oxidative coupling of thiols.
@highlight The products were obtained in high to excellent yields in a short reaction time.
@highlight MCM 41 INA Pr and MCM 41 INA Dy catalysts could be reused several cycles without significant loss in activity.
