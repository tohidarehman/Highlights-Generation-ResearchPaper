 The development of phase change materials with high energy density is of great importance for thermal or solar energy storage . Here we report for the first time the exploitation of fatty amines as a new family of organic PCMs with the latent heat in the range of 260437kJkg

@highlight Fatty amines FAs were first exploited as a new class of phase change materials PCMs .
@highlight FAs show extremely high latent heat in the range of 260437kJkg
@highlight It is the highest value for organic PCMs reported to date.
@highlight FAs show low supercooling degree 10C and phase transition temperature of 25.871.6C.
@highlight Form stable PCMs composites with enhanced FAs uptake were also prepared.
