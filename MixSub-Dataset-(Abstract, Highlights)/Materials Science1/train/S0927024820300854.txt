 PbS colloidal quantum dot solar cells are promising photovoltaic devices with a broad spectral response solution processability and long term air stability . Recently major progresses have been achieved in the performance enhancement of CQDSCs through the chemical surface passivation of CQDs and the device engineering . However the p type PbS EDT hole extraction layer presents high surface trap density which induces charge recombination risk and blocks the hole extraction at the PbS EDT Au interface . Herein we demonstrated a method to passivate the surface traps of PbS EDT film by post depositing an aluminum oxide Al

@highlight PbS EDT Au interface was modified by the ultrathin ALD Al
@highlight layer.
@highlight ALD Al
@highlight passivated the surface defects of PbS EDT.
@highlight ALD Al
@highlight efficiently removed the hole extraction barrier at the PbS EDT Au interface.
@highlight Device with ALD Al
@highlight layer reached an efficiency of 7 34 improvement compared with that of the reference device.
