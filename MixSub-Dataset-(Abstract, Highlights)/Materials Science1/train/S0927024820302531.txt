 Next generation concentrated solar power plants are expected to work above the current temperature limit of 565C for the benefit of enhanced efficiency . This poses significant challenges in the construction materials among others in terms of corrosion . In this work we investigate the spray graphitization method to improve the compatibility of SS310 and SS347 with molten Li

@highlight Graphitization improves compatibility of SS310 and SS347 with molten carbonate salt.
@highlight Carbonate carbide formation prevent chromium oxide dissolution and peel off.
@highlight Reaction of graphite with metal results in carbide formation the case of SS310.
@highlight Oxidation of graphite results in carbonate formation the case of SS347.
@highlight Carbonate phase provides superior protection compared to carbide phase.
