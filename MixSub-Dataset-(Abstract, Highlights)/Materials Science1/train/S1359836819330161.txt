 There have been major efforts to make polyacrylonitrile flame retardant using halogens heavy metals transition metals and phosphorus organic compounds . These retardants may reduce the risk of fire but they also involve high cost toxicity and related ecological issues . In an effort to mitigate some of these negative factors we herein report the development of a green flame retardant PAN based on bio inspired dopamine methacrylamide co monomer . This polymer was synthesized through free radical polymerization of AN and acetonide protected dopamine methacrylamide followed by deprotection of ADMA . Systematic investigation of the structural evolution of P AN

@highlight The bio inspired DMA co monomer and polymers P AN 
@highlight  DMA were newly synthesized.
@highlight Catechol unit of P AN 
@highlight  DMA provides a kinetic advantage for TOS process and high flame retarding properties.
@highlight P AN 
@highlight  DMA showed ultra low heat release capacity 58 Jg
@highlight  and high limiting oxygen index 37 .
