 The ceramic particle reinforced foam filled carbon fiber reinforced composites sandwich unit cell subjected to quasi static and dynamic compressions are studied experimentally . The weight fraction of the ceramic particle is discussed to analyze its effect on the failure and energy absorption of the composite cells . The results show that the failure modes and energy absorption mechanisms of the cell are influenced significantly by the strain rate and ceramic particle reinforcement effects . The cluster of the particle makes the strut experience node failure under impulsive loadings not the strut buckling and fracture shown at other cells . The mechanical property especially the plateau stress is enhanced noticeably as the foam is reinforced with the higher weight fraction of ceramic particles . The filling foams improve the impact resistance of the cells by transmitting less impulses and absorbing more energy . With a higher energy absorption efficiency the foam filled cell with higher weight fraction of ceramic particle has the highest energy absorption capacity under the quasi static compression . Under the impulsive loading the increasing ceramic particles can reduce the transmitted impulse but can not absorb additional energy .
