 Sensible heat storage is a cost efficient and scalable technology for energy storage . The state of the art storage systems in concentrating solar power plants use the storage material Solar Salt which is a nitrate salt mixture . Chemical stability of this salt material is crucial for lifetime reliance and for development of the storage technology towards higher temperatures . High temperatures enhance the storage capacity but also promote decomposition reactions . For instance harmful gases can evolve and oxide ions are produced which aggravate corrosion . Up to now it is unclear how to describe the salt chemistry and how to quantitatively predict the problematic decomposition products . The experimental method in this study is chosen with regard to the exclusion of mass transport limitations . Thin films of salt are heated to 560630C . The salt composition is analyzed by ion chromatography and acid base titration . The ratio of nitrite to nitrate ions stabilizes which indicates chemical equilibrium of the nitrite forming reaction . The oxide content increases continuously over time and is interpreted in terms of a kinetic rate law . A consistent mathematical description of Solar Salt chemistry at high temperatures in contact with air is presented . It includes thermodynamic parameters in particular the reaction enthalpy of 954kJmol
