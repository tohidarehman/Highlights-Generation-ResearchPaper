 Using the First Principles calculations within the frame work of density functional theory the structural electronic and magnetic properties were determined . Co doping of halogen atoms in the host MgO with 12.5 concentration was performed and the half metallicity property was investigated . It is very interesting that co doping of halogen atoms in the host MgO plays a vital role in exhibiting the half metallic nature of the super cells Cl
