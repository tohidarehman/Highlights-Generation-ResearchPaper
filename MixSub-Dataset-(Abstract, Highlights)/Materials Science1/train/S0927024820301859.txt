 Superhydrophobic self cleaning covers exhibiting small roll off angles of water droplets mitigate the soiling of photovoltaic modules . In this work microcone textured fluorinated ethylene propylene covers attached to the front side of PV modules offer improved performance via dual functionality namely via self cleaning and reduced parasitic reflection losses . The aspect ratio of the FEP microcone textures was investigated in view of both functionalities . The best performing microcone textured cover demonstrated a significant enhancement in short circuit current density

@highlight Superhydrophobicity achieved with microcone textured FEP for all aspect ratios.
@highlight Optimum aspect ratio of 0.7 enhances both self cleaning and light harvesting.
@highlight Significant self cleaning enhancement observed for two distinct soil types.
@highlight Relative 2.9 power conversion efficiency enhancement for CIGS mini modules.
@highlight Even imperfect microcone textures in FEP achieved superhydrophobicity.
