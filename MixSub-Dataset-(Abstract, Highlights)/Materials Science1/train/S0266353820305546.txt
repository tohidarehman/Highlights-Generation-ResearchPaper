 Radar absorbing structures with multiple resistive frequency selective surfaces are of great potential in the aerospace and marine fields . However reliable theoretical prediction models of multilayer circuit analog absorbers together with proper optimizing programs have not yet well been established despite the large number of reported investigations . Herein a precise and comprehensive optimization method was proposed for the design of lightweight and broadband absorbing structures based on improved genetic algorithm . To this end the spatial scale effect of the entire structures and interlayer interference effects between FSS films were firstly considered . Several absorbing sandwich structures composed of fiber reinforced epoxy facesheets polyvinyl chloride foam and FSS films with square patterns of various periods were then fabricated . The environmental adaptabilities of the as obtained absorbing structures were assessed through electromagnetic and load bearing experimental tests under different ambient temperatures and marine corrosion durations . The optimized absorbing sandwich structures displayed ultra broadband absorbing capabilities from 2 to 17GHz and average bending strength of 80MPa . The influence of ambient temperature on absorbing capability was slight due to the thermostability of carbon conductive ink . In addition degeneration effect of marine corrosion on the absorbing capability was initially severe but tended to stabilize as corrosion process proceeded . The results of this study provide a useful guideline for the design of integrated multi functional absorbing composite structures for actual applications .
