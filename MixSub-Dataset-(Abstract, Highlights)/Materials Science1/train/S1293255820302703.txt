 Wurtzite form of ZnS has been prepared by heating zinc ethane thiol complex at a relatively low temperature of less than 300C . This low temperature synthesized high temperature form of ZnS is quite stable and does not undergo conversion to cubic form even at annealing temperatures as high as 900C . The
