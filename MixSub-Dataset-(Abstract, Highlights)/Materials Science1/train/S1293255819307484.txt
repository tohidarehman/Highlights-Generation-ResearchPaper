 Oxygen vacancy in ceria based support is a dominate factor for catalyzing the water gas shift reaction by faster a redox cycle between Ce

@highlight Strain and unbalanced upon addition of Sm
@highlight lead to formation of oxygen vacancy.
@highlight Oxygen defects in CeO
@highlight lattice play a role in facilitating redox cycle.
@highlight Faster redox cycle between Ce
@highlight and Ce
@highlight lead to higher catalytic activity.
@highlight Faster redox cycle can be evidenced by temperature resolved in situ XANES.
@highlight Sm addition improve redox properties and promote dispersion of Pd on CeO
@highlight surface.
