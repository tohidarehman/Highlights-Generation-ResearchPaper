 In this study the feasibility of a novel tactile display based on the magnetorheological elastomers was studied . To this end initially a survey on various requirements of tactile displays for surgical applications was performed . The survey showed that MREs would make a good fit for tactile displays . To further study the MREs the samples were characterized perpendicular to the magnetic field similar to the actual use cases . Also to compensate for the loss of MR effect due to the non parallel application of compression and magnetic field MREs were composited in bi layer configuration with a non MRE elastomer . The results of mechanical characterization showed that bi layer composition increased the MR effect in MREs by 42 . This study showed that further enhancement of MR effect in MREs is possible through bi layer composition with a non MRE elastomer . Also it was shown that the development of an MRE based tactile display is feasible using the proposed enhanced MRE composites .

@highlight MREs are the most compliant modality for tactile displays in minimally invasive and robotic surgery applications.
@highlight MR effect of various MREs were enhanced through bi layer composition with a non MRE without changing iron particle content.
@highlight The enhancement of MR effect through bi layer composition was comparable to the effect of increasing iron particle content .
