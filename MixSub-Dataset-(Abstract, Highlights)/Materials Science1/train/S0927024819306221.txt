 In this work a series of dual functional materials 4 4 4 4 tetrabenzoates were developed with an aggregation induced emission luminogenic center and electrochromically active moieties . The highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of the ETBAs were determined via density functional theory calculations . The fluorescent electrochemical and electrochromic performances of the ETBAs were characterized via fluorescence spectroscopy cyclic voltammetry UVVis spectroscopy and chronoamperometry . All the ETBAs demonstrated an AIE effect in water N methyl pyrrolidone . The ETBAs underwent a quasi reversible reduction oxidation . Electrochromic devices based on the ETBAs exhibited a significant color change from a transparent bleached state to a colored blue state high optical contrast and large coloration efficiency . The used substituents markedly influenced the cyclability and response time and compounds with a larger conjugation degree had lower energy gap values and faster response time . Compound
