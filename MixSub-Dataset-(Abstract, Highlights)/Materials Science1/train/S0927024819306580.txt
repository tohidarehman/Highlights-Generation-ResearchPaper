 Conductive polymer polyaniline demonstrates potential applications in developing integrated smart energy devices based on the bi functional electrochromic optical modulation and electrochemical energy storage . One challenge is to improve the structural stability of PANI films in response to repeating doping and dedoping of anions during the electrochemical redox process . Herein a facile and effective approach is developed for improving the electrochemical performance of PANI by coating onto the carbon nanotube conductive networks . The introduction of CNT firstly provides multiple directions for electron transfer and thus enhances the charge capacity of PANI . Then the polymerization of PANI onto the CNT

@highlight polymerization of PANI onto theCNT conductive networks contributes to the formation of a 3D network film.
@highlight Bi functional electrochromism and energy storage of PANI improves by coating onto the CNT conductive networks because multiple directions for electron transfer enhancesthe charge capacity of PANI.
@highlight A smart electrochromic supercapacitor is developed whose energy storage level could be detected by a visual chromatic transition.
