 New electrochromic devices based on six extended viologen derivatives with various aromatic substituents were manufactured and systematically investigated . With the introduction of various substituents six extended viologen derivatives exhibit an unprecedented electrochromic property among previous researches on viologens . Electrochromic devices containing these derivatives as the working electrode present vivid color changes high optical contrast fast response and excellent durability . Additionally the extended skeletal pyridine system endows these viologens derivatives with unanticipated electrofluorochromic behavior which provides the devices of these extended viologens multifunction . To sum up preeminent optical and electrical performances indicate that these extended viologen derivatives are promising for new generation electrochromic applications .

@highlight Six extended viologen derivatives with such benzene substituents have rarely been investigated in the electrochromic field.
@highlight ECDs of the six derivatives achieve high optical contrast in the range of 59 81 .
@highlight ECDs reveal infrequent crimson and darkorchid tint in colored state among previous researches in viologens.
@highlight ECDs of Hydro V Oxy V and Dioxy V exhibit fluorescence which is same as the electrofluorochromic materials.
@highlight ECDs reveal rapid switching behavior within few seconds and outstanding stability over thousand cycles.
