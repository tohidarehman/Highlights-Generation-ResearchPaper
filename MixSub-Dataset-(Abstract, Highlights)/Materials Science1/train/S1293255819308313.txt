 This report signifies the synthesis of ZnO nanorods cotton ball like structures nanospheres and their Cu loaded counterparts for effective photocatalytic degradation of methyl parathion pesticide under UV light . Pesticides accumulation in ecosystem becomes major problem which affects health . Zinc oxide is a promising photocatalyst for degradation of pesticides and dyes because of its higher stability low cost and non toxic nature . Herein the synthesized catalysts were characterised by diffused reflectance spectroscopy X ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy techniques and transmission electron microscopy . ZnO nanorods proved to be better catalyst as compare to other synthesized nanostructures because of its elongated morphology . ZNR were nearly 1.4 times more efficient than ZnO cotton ball like structures . Moreover photocatalytic activity was also enhanced by Cu loading due to low recombination rate of excitons . Cu loaded ZNR were found to degrade whole compound up to 99 in just 80min whereas bare ZNR took 3h under similar conditions . Thus efficiency of Cu ZNR had been increased nearly 6 folds as that of bare ZNR .

@highlight Morphology of the catalysts influenced reaction efficiency.
@highlight Cu loading has improved methyl parathion MP degradation rates.
@highlight Cu deposited ZnO nanorods like particles degraded MP upto 99 in just 80min.
