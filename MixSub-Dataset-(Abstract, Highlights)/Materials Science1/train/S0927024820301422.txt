 Soiling impacts the photovoltaic module performance by reducing the amount of light reaching the photovoltaic cells and by changing their external spectral response . Currently the soiling monitoring market is moving toward optical sensors that measure transmittance or reflectance rather than directly measuring the impact of soiling on the performance of photovoltaic modules . These sensors which use a single optical measurement are not able to correct the soiling losses that depend on the solar irradiance spectra and on the spectral response of the monitored PV material . This work investigates methods that can improve the optical detection of soiling by extracting the full soiling spectrum profiles using only two or three monochromatic measurements . Spectral transmittance data measured with a spectrophotometer and collected during a 46 week experimental soiling study carried out in Jan Spain was analysed in this work . The use of a spectral profile for the hemispherical transmittance of soiled PV glass is found to significantly improve the soiling detection returning the lowest errors independently of the PV materials and irradiance conditions . In addition this work shows that it is also possible to select the measurement wavelengths to minimize the soiling loss detection error depending on the monitored PV semiconductor material . The approaches discussed in this work are also found to be more robust to potential measurement errors compared to single wavelength measurement techniques .

@highlight Using spectral models increases the accuracy in optical soiling detection.
@highlight The full soiling spectral transmittance can be modelled with 3 measurements.
@highlight Each PV material has wavelength combinations at which the error is minimized.
@highlight Spectral models can adjust the measurement to various materials and irradiances.
@highlight The use of spectral models is expected to be more beneficial as soiling increases.
