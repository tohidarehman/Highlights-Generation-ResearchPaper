 Due to the chemical inertness of the polyester fiber surface it often needs to be immersed in a traditional resorcinol formaldehyde latex dipping solution before it can be used in rubber composite . However the RFL dipping system contains toxic components resorcinol and formaldehyde and is gradually banned . In this article a novel resorcinol formaldehyde free environmentally friendly adhesion promoter for dipping treatment of PET fiber was synthesized . Specifically water soluble ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether and diethylenetriamine were introduced into the new dipping solution to replace the toxic ingredients of resorcinol and formaldehyde in RFL dipping system . We use polyester fabrics to study the effects of reaction conditions chemical structures and interfacial adhesion mechanism on the treatment results to achieve the level of conventional RFL treatment . The surface chemical compositions of modified PET fabrics were characterized by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy . The results showed that the fabric surface was successfully coated with the dipping layer . In addition interfacial adhesive properties between modified PET fabrics and rubber were studied . The results showed that the peel adhesive strength between the modified PET fabric and the rubber was 17N mm which was comparable to the RFL dipping system .
