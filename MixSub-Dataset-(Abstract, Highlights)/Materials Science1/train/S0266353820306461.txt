 Herein two sets of shape memory polyurethane nanocomposites comprising 3 and 1wt of reduced graphene oxide and reduced octadecyl isocyanate functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets respectively were fabricated by solution casting approach . Fourier transform infrared analysis verified linking of octadecyl isocyanate to GO nanosheets via addition reaction of NCO groups with OH and COOH groups and formation of urethane and amide functionalities . The grafting content was determined through thermal gravimetric analysis which was about 15wt of R nanosheets . The appropriate dispersion of R nanosheets compared to R nanosheets in PU was studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy . Additionally better distribution level of R nanosheets caused PU R nanocomposites to possess greater modulus and lower elongation at break than PU RGO nanocomposites . Moreover PU R nanocomposites showed greater shape memory fixities due to more effective stress transfer of R nanosheets than that of RGO nanosheets .

@highlight Graphene oxide nanosheets were functionalized by octadecyl isocyanate.
@highlight The modified nanosheets were chemically reduced.
@highlight The resulting nanosheets were used to prepare shape memory PU nanocomposites.
@highlight Thermal mechanical and shape memory properties of the nanocomposites were studied.
