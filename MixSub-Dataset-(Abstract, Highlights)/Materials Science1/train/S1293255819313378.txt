 Cool Spark Plasma Sintering recently emerged as an efficient approach to sinter thermodynamically fragile materials . In the context of an exploratory study aiming at the identification of new fragile ferroic materials high density ceramics of copper acetate diamine Cu CH

@highlight Cool SPS allows densification of molecular material.
@highlight Pressure can be used to stabilize the phase at higher temperatures.
@highlight Sintering does not impact structure quality of the material.
