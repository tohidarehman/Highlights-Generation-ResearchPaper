 In this study conductive cellulose nanocrystals were coated with polypyrrole using in situ chemical polymerization to form CNC PPy conductive nano network . The one pot polymerization of hard segment methyl methacrylate was continued onto above functionalized CNCs then blended with soft molecular segment polyvinyl alcohol to contain self healing and conductive composite film fabricated by soft hard network . In addition the tensile strength of CPMV films with 2wt CNC PPy was enhanced by 47.1 . Also CPMV films exhibited self healing properties due to the presence of hydrogen bonding dynamic network and showed sensitive resistance changes under external stimuli which could be used to monitor various actions of the human body . Thus the CPMV films present potential applications in electronic devices such as flexible electrodes biosensors and implantable devices .
