 This paper elaborates the compatibility of SS316L alloy with LiNaK carbonate for concentrated solar power plant applications . In this study corrosion behavior and corrosion mechanism of SS316L in the eutectic LiNaK carbonate molten salt at 600C and 700C were investigated in detail . The results revealed that the corrosion process of stainless steel 316L in the LiNaK carbonate molten salt is mainly divided into four successive steps selective oxidation process of metals lithiation reaction of the oxide formation of a dual structured corrosion scale separation and spalling of corrosion products . Moreover increasing temperature to 700C results in a severe corrosion of SS316L in the molten carbonate salt . Therefore it is imperative to explore a suitable protective coating for SS316L to use it as a structural material in concentrated solar power plant .

@highlight Compatibility of SS316L with LiNaK carbonate was elaborated for CSP applications.
@highlight The corrosion mechanism for SS316L in carbonate salt was studied in detail.
@highlight The corrosion products were arranged in a dual structured scale after long test time.
@highlight Higher temperature accelerated the corrosion process.
