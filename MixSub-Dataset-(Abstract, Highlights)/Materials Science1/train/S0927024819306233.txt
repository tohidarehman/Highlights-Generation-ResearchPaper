 The degradation induced polymer photoluminescence and absorbance spectra of two differently stabilized commercial EVA grades are investigated under conditions of exposure to dry heat at 85C 115C and 135C and moisture of 85 relative humidity at 85C . In addition to the photoluminescence signal as described before new features are identified for both absorbance and photoluminescence spectra . Most prominently the formerly suggested initial luminescence signal of the model of degradation induced polymer photoluminescence is identified at an emission wavelength of about 310nm . It is shown to exhibit a sequential reaction kinetics and to be related to the absorbance of carbonyl sates at 285nm . The kinetic parameters of these signals are quantitatively evaluated and discussed in the scope chemical degradation and physical relaxation processes . We demonstrate that additive formulations can be distinguished by means of degradation induced polymer photoluminescence enabling its application for the characterization and optimization of polymeric materials .

@highlight New photoluminescence and absorbance signals related to the chemical degradation of polymeric materials have been identified.
@highlight It is shown that photoluminescence kinetics can be employed for the characterization of stabilized EVA materials.
@highlight Quantitative evaluation of kinetics leads to apparent activation energies consistent with reports in the literature.
