 An extra large pore aluminophosphate molecular sieve with CLO topology was successfully synthesized in low dosage ionic liquids via a simplified ionothermal route for which all raw materials were firstly mixed together and then ground into homogeneous gels followed by high temperature crystallization . A representative CLO type sample was characterized by XRD SEM N
