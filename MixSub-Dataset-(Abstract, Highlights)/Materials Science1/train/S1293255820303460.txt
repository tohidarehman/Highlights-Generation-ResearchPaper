 1 dimensional GaN nanowires and nanorods grown using catalyst assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition are investigated for their structural and optical properties and their electronic band structure . X ray Diffraction studies reveal that biaxial strain increases with aspect ratio which is corroborated by Raman studies wherein phonon related confinement effects are observed for NR due to the crystal strain . Photoluminescence studies show 3 and 6 times enhancement in the intensity of band edge emission of NW and NR respectively signifying the presence of a large number of band tail states . A small red shift in NW and large red shift in NR is reported which are attributed to the change in the band gap and band structure of these morphologies . Valence band studies by X ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy reveal the presence of band tail states for NR and surface bond contraction for NW . The effect of crystal strain on the electronic band structure on optical properties of 1 D GaN nanostructures with different aspect ratios is elucidated .

@highlight One dimensional GaN nanostructures with high and low aspect ratio have been grown using Chemical Vapour Deposition by VLS mechanism.
