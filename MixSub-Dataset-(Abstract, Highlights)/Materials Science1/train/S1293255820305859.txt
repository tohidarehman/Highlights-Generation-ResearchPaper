 The main goal of this work is to study the effect of irradiation with protons with an energy of 0.51.5MeVat a fluence of 110

@highlight Dynamics of changes in the degree of disorder of the crystal lattice.
@highlight Studies of the mechanical and strength properties.
@highlight Changes in the degree of destruction of ceramics before and after tests.
@highlight The dependences of the degree of radiation damage occurring upon irradiation with protons.
