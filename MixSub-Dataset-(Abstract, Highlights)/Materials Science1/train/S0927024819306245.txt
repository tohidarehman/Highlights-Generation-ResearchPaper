 Currently photovoltaics have been used on a large scale for commercial and civilian use . Aging short circuit fire and other reasons will bring great security risks . In this paper an experimental study of burning and toxic hazards was carried out on a widely used flammable photovoltaic panel with a sample size of 180mm 180mmat atmospheric conditions . Combustion experiments were performed on the early stage fire characteristics bench of State Key Laboratory of Fire Science in China . Several important combustion parameters were investigated by oxygen consumption method under four representative external thermal 15kW m

@highlight PET laminated photovoltaic panels have a high risk of thermal runaway.
@highlight Experimental combustion characteristics and thermodynamic data were compared.
@highlight The toxic gas hazard of photovoltaic panels caused by thermal runaway is concerned.
@highlight Toxic gas model in International Standard was used to assess the toxicity hazards.
