 Interfacial solar steam generation is an eco friend and energy efficient way of harvesting solar energy for desalination and wastewater treatment . For the solar steam generation the primary focus is to design new materials that are fully sunlight absorption fast photothermal conversion and low heat emissivity . Here a novel hollow copper sulfide nanocubes with concave surface is used for rapid and efficient solar steam generation through the micro thermal management . Interestingly the emissivity of CuS foam is as low as 0.64 whose absorption is more than 97 and strongly dependents on the structure and morphology . The unique concave structure of hollow CuS can trap the sunlight by reabsorption as well as recover radiative and convective heat loss . As a result the CuS based generator exhibits a high evaporation efficiency of 91.5 under one sun illumination . Furthermore the device can maintain a stable performance of solar steam generation during the cyclic seawater desalination . The novel structure design based on the micro thermal management offers a new insight into the future development of highly efficient solar steam generation .
