 Nano texture has the potential to reduce the optical losses of crystalline silicon solar cells . RIE fabricated black silicon enables near zero reflectance across a broad range of wavelengths and the angular dependence has been shown to be superior to existing technologies . However in front contact cells which are the current industrial mainstream architecture the emitter is located on the front textured side and is typically realized by POCl

@highlight The electrical properties of POCl
@highlight diffused nanotextured emitter were studied.
@highlight In situ oxidation has shown to be effective in reducing emitter recombination on nanotextured surface.
@highlight Enhanced field effect passivation has shown to be crucial for further improvement.
@highlight Two fundamental limiting factors on the electrical performance of nanotextured emitter surface were suggested.
