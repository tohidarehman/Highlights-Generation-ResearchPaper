 In this research study we investigate the structural electronic and optical properties of the Cr doped rocksalt CdS using a full potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the density functional theory . The calculations are made within the GGA and GGA U approaches employed in the Wien2K code . Adding the Hubbard term gives better description of the system with strong correlation of
