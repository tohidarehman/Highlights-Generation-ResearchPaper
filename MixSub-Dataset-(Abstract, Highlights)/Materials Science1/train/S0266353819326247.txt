 Nanoparticles significantly reinforce rubber and enhance nonlinear rheological behaviors while the underlining mechanisms are not yet clear . Herein a time concentration superposition principle is employed for constructing master curves of high frequency linear rheology of hydrophobic silica filled natural rubber compounds with reference to the matrix . The effect of dynamics retardation of the matrix disclosed by the TCS principle is explained by the time dependent diffusion double reptation model that predicts linear rheology well covers the TCS mater curves in the nonterminal region . With aid of the convective constrain release model the Payne effect of the compounds is shown to originate mainly from the filler promoted disentanglement of chains in the matrix whose local strain amplitude is amplified by the filler . Furthermore the filler is shown to be able to enhance both the elastic and viscous nonlinearities of compounds under large strain amplitudes .

@highlight Dynamics retardation of the matrix contributes to reinforcement and dissipation.
@highlight Chain disentanglement of retarded polymers can account for Payne effect and strain overshoot.
@highlight Filler can enhances both the elastic and viscous nonlinearities by strain amplification.
