 Nano crystalline powders of LuAG Eu with different grain sizes were prepared by Pechini and co precipitation methods . XRD and FTIR analyses were done . The XRD measurement confirmed the cubic structure of nano crystalline powders . The morphology and grain size of nano crystalline powders were confirmed by TEM analysis . The minimum and maximum of crystallite sizes were obtained 17 and 46nm by the Rietveld method . The results of UVVisible absorption analysis showed that the energy absorption value was increased for nano crystalline powder prepared at 900 1200C by Pichini and co precipitation methods . The emission excitation and quantum efficiency were investigated . The overall shape of emission and excitation spectra was not changed with increasing of nano crystalline powder size but the emission intensities were increased . Decay time was decreased with increasing the size of nano crystalline powders . The X ray luminescence results were examined at room temperature for different currents and a constant voltage . The luminescence intensity was increased linearly with increasing the X ray current . TL glow curves of nano crystalline powder exposed to X rays for 2 4 and 6min showed two main peaks around 400 and 600K . A glow curve deconvolution and origin software were used to calculate TL kinetic parameters .
