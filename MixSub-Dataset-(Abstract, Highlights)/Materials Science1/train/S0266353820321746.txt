 Comprehensive utilization of bio based polymers such as cellulosic materials for water purification has drawn intensive attention in recent years . Herein we demonstrate using cellulose rich corncob residues as scaffolds for in situ anchoring Ag NPs decorated ZIF 8 nanohybrids to fabricate multifunction biosorbents with robust adsorption catalytic performance and antibacterial activity for the above purpose via a simple tea bag strategy . Results show that upon delignification and TEMPO oxidation the porous corncob particles have high contents of cellulose fraction and carboxyl groups with rough surfaces thus facilitating the anchoring and dispersion of the nanosized ZIF 8s via enhanced coordination . The corncob supported porous ZIF 8s loaded with well dispersed Ag NPs in their matrix can lead to corncob based adsorbents Ag
