 Heat localization has been proposed as a new strategy to utilize solar energy efficiently . In the past few years extensive research on heat localization has been limited to solar steam generation . Many devices have been designed to improve the efficiency of photothermal conversion but the complex preparation processes and the cycle instability limit its large scale practical application . Herein we fixed reduced graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles on a melamine sponge skeleton by a simple coating method . The modified sponge retained the high porosity of the sponge substrate and exhibited photothermal properties and hydrophobicity . Consequently the modified sponge showed a high solar steam evaporation efficiency under one sun irradiation and an excellent adsorption capacity to organic solvents and low viscosity oils . The modified sponge also reduced the viscosity of the heavy crude oil under the driving of solar energy to achieve a high adsorption capacity of heavy crude oil . Because of the excellent mechanical properties of the melamine sponge substrate the modified sponge had great reusable performances and met the simple and scalable manufacturing requirements in practical applications . This material provides a new idea for the recovery of heavy crude oil and provides new applications for photothermal conversion materials .
