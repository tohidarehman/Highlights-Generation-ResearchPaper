 In this study to investigate the possible structural change at 550K the temperature dependence of powder X ray diffraction patterns of rhombohedral boron for a wide temperature range between 270 and 873K was measured . We indexed all powder XRD patterns as rhombohedral boron for a whole temperature range however we observed that at 550K the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters changed their slope . Moreover at a temperature 600K we observed a drastically structural and local B

@highlight We investigate the possible structural change of rhombohedral boron around 550K by powder X ray diffraction experiment.
@highlight Drastically structural and local B12 icosahedral cluster volume change is observed above 550 K.
@highlight Our observation is the direct verification of the inter atomic hopping of boron atom above 550K.
