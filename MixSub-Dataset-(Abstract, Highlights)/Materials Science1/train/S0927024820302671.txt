 Current sub ambient daytime radiative cooling designs are generally evaluated in a well insulated apparatus to suppress heat convection and conduction with the surrounding environment . In a companion study we experimentally demonstrated that serial waterborne coatings which combined particle scattering sunlight excited fluorescence and mid infrared broadband radiation exhibited pronounced SDRC effects on various substrates installed on a well designed rooftop setup under different climatic conditions . In this study we experimentally show that the coating with yellow green fluorescence can achieve meaningful SDRC under real working conditions . When applied to a concrete scale model building the FR coating showed a significant SDRC effect compared with other substrates installed on the rooftop cooling device and an assembled corrugated steel house . The average decrease in sub ambient temperature under direct sunlight was 10.11.4C with a maximum value of 12.4C under a peak solar intensity of 999W m

@highlight The FR coating exhibits a distinct SDRC effect under real working conditions.
@highlight The FR coating over a concrete roof surface shows a more notable SDRC effect.
@highlight The SDRC design does not necessarily result in detrimental effects in winter.
@highlight The FR coating has excellent durability and outstanding self cleaning properties.
