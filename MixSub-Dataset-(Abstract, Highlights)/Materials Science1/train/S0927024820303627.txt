 Four Moroccan local industrial wastes were identified as potential high temperature thermal energy storage materials for application in solar tower power plants . These wastes are namely induction furnace slag from the metallurgical industry and three solid wastes from the coal fired power plant industry coal bottom ashes and coal bottom clinker . In the present paper these wastes would be used as raw materials to develop synthesize novel low cost high temperature TES materials for the same application . The main motive of this work is to manufacture enhanced versions of the selected wastes in order to eliminate their main points of weakness i.e . their glassy form which restricts their structural strengths transform the wastes in the form of powder into solid crystalline materials with improved TES properties and in the desired regular shapes . To fulfill this aim a summary of the results of the different conducted characterizations on the four raw materials is presented . Then the used synthesis method is described from the preparation of the raw materials formulations to the obtained final products . Finally a laboratory experimental investigation was conducted on these obtained materials in order to assess their potential for TES application up to 1000C . Thus their structural and thermophysical properties were evaluated as well as their thermal stability up to 1000C . The obtained results suggest that most of the synthesized materials are good candidate materials for high temperature thermal energy storage application .
