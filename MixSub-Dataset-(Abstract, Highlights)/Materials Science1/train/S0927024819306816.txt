 This paper addresses the influence of III V nucleation routines on Ge substrates for the growth of high efficiency multijunction solar cells . Three exemplary nucleation routines with differences in thickness and temperature were evaluated . The resulting open circuit voltage of triple junction solar cells with these designs is significantly affected whereas minimal differences in short circuit current are observed . Electroluminescence measurements show that both the Ge bottom cell and the GaAs middle cell present a V

@highlight III V Ge nucleation routines play an important role when growing high efficiency multijunction solar cells by MOVPE.
@highlight The Ge bottom cell depends on both the nucleation routine and the thermal load associated to the growth of upper subcells.
@highlight Nucleation routines affect not only to the Ge cell performance but also to upper layers such as the Ga In As middle cell.
@highlight Nucleation routines with smaller thermal loads produce notably higher J
