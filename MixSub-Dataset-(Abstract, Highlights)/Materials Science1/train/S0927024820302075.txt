 In recent times solar driven desalination has emerged as a sustainable solution for the impending water crisis . Herein we report a novel solar driven steam generator manufactured from porous carbon derived from sweet lime peels and polyvinyl alcohol sponge for efficient steam generation and its application in solar seawater desalination . The solar steam generator fabricated with a unidirectional pathway design satisfactorily absorbed incoming solar illumination provided localized heat at the air water interface and produced steam at a rate of 1.386kgm

@highlight A novel solar steam generator utilizing biomass materials i.e sweet lime peels.
@highlight An extremely high solar thermal efficiency of 90.88 was achieved at 1 sun illumination which is among the highest reported till date.
@highlight The steam generator had excellent steam generation performance at low incident solar intensities as well.
@highlight A facile passive solar still was utilized for successful sea water desalination and 100 salt removal efficiency was obtained.
@highlight The solar still had excellent performance even under low solar intensities.
