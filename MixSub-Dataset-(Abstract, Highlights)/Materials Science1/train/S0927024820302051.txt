 Among common methods to form polycrystalline silicon films for passivating contact solar cells physical vapor deposition in particular sputtering is the safest one as it does not require any toxic gaseous precursors . One of the critical parameters to control the properties of sputtered silicon films is their deposition pressure . In this work structural and optoelectronic characteristics of ex situ boron doped poly Si SiO

@highlight Effects of sputtering pressure on the structural and optoelectronic properties of the as deposited a Si films and their corresponding ex situ boron doped poly Si SiO
@highlight passivating contacts were investigated.
@highlight The SiH stretching modes observed by FTIR in the as deposited films are likely a consequence of residual hydrogen incorporated to the oxide layer during its chemical growth.
@highlight The resultant poly Si SiO
@highlight contacts show a reasonably good initial passivation quality with J
@highlight of 24fA cm
@highlight at 2.5 mTorr which improves to 9fA cm
@highlight after hydrogenation treatments.
