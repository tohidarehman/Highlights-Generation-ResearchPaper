 Herein nanozeolite carbon nanotube composites with the covalently immobilized enzyme as novel bionanocomposites were synthesized and used for pollutant bio degradation . Different amounts of carbon nanotube were used to synthesize carbon nanotube zeolite nanocomposites . The synthesized nanomaterials were silanized and cross linked by glutaraldehyde . Finally the enzyme was immobilized on them to prepare Laccase immobilized nanomaterials . The biocatalysts were characterized using Scanning electron microscopy X ray diffraction pattern Fourier transform infrared Brunauer Emmett Teller and Transmission Electron Microscopy . The effect of operational parameters on bio degradation was investigated and optimized . The synthesized biocatalyst nanocomposite retained more than 95 of its initial activity over the first 5 cycles and its efficiency is still intact . After 10 cycles relative activity decreased gradually to 69 . Results revealed much higher stability for Laccase after the immobilization and 84 of the maximum activity of nanocomposite was preserved at 80C . The activity of free Laccase lost over 60 of its activity after 8 days of incubation while the nanocomposite retained about 80 of its maximal activity . They had high storage stability over 8 incubation days and good performance at thermal stability experiments .
