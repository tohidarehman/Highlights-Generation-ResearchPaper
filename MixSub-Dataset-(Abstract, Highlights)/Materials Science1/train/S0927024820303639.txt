 Optically transparent p type materials play a critical role in transparent electronics including photovoltaic devices . P type sulfide materials offer an alternative to oxides for PV application due to improved hole transport properties . Here we report the solution based synthesis of earth abundant p type transparent conducting barium copper sulfide BaCu

@highlight P type
@highlight  BCS films of 100nm thickness shows high visible spectrum transparency.
@highlight BCS thin films were prepared directly on CdTe by a solution spin coating process.
@highlight BCS films helps to increase efficiency by significant improvement of V
@highlight without intentional Cu doping.
@highlight We demonstrate a semi transparent CdTe solar cell using BCS ITO as back contact layer.
