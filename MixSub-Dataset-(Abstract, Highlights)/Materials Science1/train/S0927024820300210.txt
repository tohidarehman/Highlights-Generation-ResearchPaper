 Hole transporting layer is crucial in the development of high performance perovskite solar cell . Here Cb OMe bisaniline was prepared as a new hole transport material and stacked on poly poly layer to adjust the energy level and improve the anode interface in inverted PSCs . Cb OMe had a relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy and high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy . Its deposition on PEDOT PSS as bi HTL afforded efficient carrier transport from the perovskite absorber layer to the HTL because of the favorable energy level alignment and enhanced electrical conductivity . Furthermore since Cb OMe has a large energy band gap high optical transparency was obtained when it is stacked on PEDOT PSS . Also the obtained HTL is more hydrophilic which improved the wettability of the perovskite films . Finally the devices based on PEDOT PSS Cb OMe showed the enhanced efficiencies compared to the other conditions which were PEDOT PSS or PEDOT PSS 4 4 bisaniline based devices . As a result the introduction of Cb OMe into the cascade structure is an important help in accelerating hole carrier transport .

@highlight Newly designed Cb OMe was applied as an efficient charge transport accelerator due to its unique structural effects.
@highlight Enhanced affinity and the cascade effect of energy alignment were achieved via stacking Cb OMe between PEDOT PSS and MAPbI
