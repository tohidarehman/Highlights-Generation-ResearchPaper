 Various molar ratio CdS nanoparticles were successfully decorated on the surfaces of anatase TiO2 nanobelts synthesized by hydrothermal method . When the molar ratio of CdS to anatase TiO2 is 10 100 CdS NPs with smaller size were uniformly decorated on the anatase TiO2 NBs . The XRD results indicated that the products were composed of anatase TiO2 and hexagonal CdS . Photoluminescence emission UVVis absorption spectra photocurrent spectra and electrochemical impedance spectra of the as prepared samples demonstrated that the CdS NPs contributed to the enhancement of properties of composites . And the TC 10 exhibited the best photoelectrochemical properties . The rhodamine B photocatalytic degradation experiments under 300W Xenon lamp irradiation showed that CdS favors the improvement of degradation ratios . The TC 10 has the highest degradation ratio of RhB which should be attributed to the formation of homojunction heterojunction and the uniform distribution of CdS nanoparticles with small sizes .
