 Mesoporous solid bases catalysts were prepared by impregnation of a certain amount of alkaline earthmetals species on the synthesized MCF support and used in the methanolysis of PC . Compared with the synthesized SBA 15 solid base catalysts CaO MCF catalysts with larger pore size pore volume and higher active species dispersion exhibited higher catalytic activity . The influences of supported catalyst physicochemical properties and methanolysis conditions were also investigated . The results indicated that methanolysis rate of PC was closed to 100 and yield of BPA was over 95 under the proper reaction conditions with the excellent performance of 12 CaO MCF catalyst . The catalyst stability study showed that 12 CaO MCF had good catalytic activity after five circles . At the same time the possible methanolysis mechanism of PC was proposed .

@highlight The CaO MCF catalysts having a large and open pore structure are favorable for the methanolysis of PC under milder conditions.
@highlight Well dispersion of CaO crystallite on MCF could enhance catalytic performance.
@highlight The catalyst is easily recycled and exhibits good chemical and structural stability.
@highlight An environmentally friendly strategy was provided for methanolysis of PC waste.
