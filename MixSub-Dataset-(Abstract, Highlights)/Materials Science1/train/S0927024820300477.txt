 Phase change materials store or release thermal energy during phase changing processes but their practical applications are limited by inherent deficiencies such as leakage over melting point low thermal conductivity and single driving way . We propose a novel strategy to prepare a shape stabilized PCM with enhanced thermal conductivity and efficient electric thermal light thermal energy conversion by encapsulating polyethylene glycol in composite scaffolds of boron nitride and graphene oxide

@highlight rGO bridged BN scaffolds were prepared from microwave reduction.
@highlight rGO bridged BN scaffolds were used to encapsulate polyethylene glycol.
@highlight Composite PCM exhibited good shape stability and leak free.
@highlight RGO brought enhanced thermal conductivity and various charging responsiveness.
