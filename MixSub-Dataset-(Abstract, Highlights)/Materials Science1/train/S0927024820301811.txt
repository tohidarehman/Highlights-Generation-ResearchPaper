 The implementation of inexpensive scalable thermal energy storage will play a crucial role in the successful establishment of dispatchable renewable energy technologies . Storage based on molten nitrate salts is one of the most relevant technologies implemented in the GWh scale . Yet there is significant cost reduction potential in replacing the conventional two tank system by a single tank thermocline system . The latter involves the use of a single tank design where a large fraction of the costly salt is replaced by an inexpensive filler material . Industrial waste materials such as AlferRock red mud derived Fe

@highlight A novel filler material for thermocline storage is investigated.
@highlight Salt chemistry and cross section analyses are performed.
@highlight The mixed Fe Ti Si O phases in AlferRock show high stability in Solar Salt.
@highlight Little structural changes are observed after exposure tests.
@highlight No otherwise typical dissolution of metal species in molten salt is observed.
