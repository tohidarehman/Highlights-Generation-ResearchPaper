 Tellurium allows attaining heavy n type doping levels in GaAs which is suited to achieve very low contact resistivities in solar cells . Besides it modifies the energy bandgap of MOVPE grown GaInP by reducing the group III sublattice ordering and presents a strong memory effect which induces residual n type doping in subsequent layers potentially detrimental to the performance of the solar cell . In this work we present an inverted rear heterojunction GaInP solar cell that employs a thick Te doped GaInP layer as absorber with a doping profile obtained exclusively by controlling the memory effect of Te coming from the preceding growth of a heavily doped GaAs contact layer . In this way GaInP is partially disordered with the use of no additional surfactant leading to an increase in the solar cell bandgap of around 35meV as compared to traditional samples doped with silicon . In the proof of concept experimental devices developed so far the use of a rear heterojunction configuration and the bandgap increase results in a global open circuit voltage enhancement of 109mV . The photocurrent decreases by 1.32mA cm

@highlight Electrical doping of an inverted rear heterojunction GaInP is obtained exclusively by Te memory effect.
@highlight Te acts at the same time as n type doping element and surfactant promoting GaInP disordering and increasing its bandgap.
@highlight The bandgap shift and the enhancement of the radiative efficiency leads to an open circuit increase of 109mV.
@highlight A large reduction of the emitter sheet resistance is achieved and its potential for concentration photovoltaics is assessed.
