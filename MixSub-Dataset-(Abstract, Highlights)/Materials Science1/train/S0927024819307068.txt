 The surface passivation strategy is one of the effective ways to improve the power conversion efficiency of quantum dots sensitized solar cells . In this work a novel ZnS SiO

@highlight Zn Ti MMO based LDH were used as QDSSC photoanode.
@highlight ZnS SiO
@highlight coating was used as passivation layer for QDSSC.
@highlight Passivation layers improves PCE of the QDSSC.
@highlight Best PCE achieved 4.91 with ZnS 1h SiO
@highlight coating.
@highlight The existence of ZnS SiO
@highlight outer layers play a decisive role.
