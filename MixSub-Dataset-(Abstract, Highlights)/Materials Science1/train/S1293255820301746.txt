 In this manuscript we have explored the potential of Copper Zinc Tin Sulfide nano crystals for thermoelectric power generation application by the engineering of secondary phases . CZTS nano crystals were grown on various substrates multi crystalline silicon Soda Lime Glass and Indium Tin Oxide coated glass using sol gel solution technique . The grown samples were sulphurized in tube furnace at 500C for 20min under vacuum . It was observed that sample grown on mc Si has highest Seebeck coefficient of 667V

@highlight Growth of CZTS nano crystals by sol gel on different substrates.
@highlight Seebeck coefficient and power factor measurements.
@highlight CZTS mc Si has highest value of Seebeck coefficient and power factor.
@highlight The enhancement in Seebeck coefficient is due to secondary phases in CZTS mc Si.
@highlight The presence of secondary phases confirmed by XRD Raman spectroscopy SEM and UVVis.
