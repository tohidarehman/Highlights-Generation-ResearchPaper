 Hybrid nanofluids have an advanced application prospect in the community of heat transfer fluids and particularly for the direct absorption solar collectors . Therefore stable ethylene glycol based SiC MWCNTs nanofluids with mass fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1 were prepared in this study . Combined with the unique properties of these two nanomaterials the studied hybrid nanofluids displayed excellent stability optical properties and photothermal conversion properties . The purpose of this paper is to simultaneously achieve the enhanced stability and high solar thermal conversion efficiency of hybrid nanofluids used for DASC applications . The stability of hybrid nanofluids was confirmed . In addition the hybrid nanofluids displayed an excellent solar irradiation absorption capacity in both visible and near infrared regions . The fact proved that the hybrid nanofluid was effective working fluid in DASCs where 0.5wt SiC MWCNTs nanofluids could absorb 99.9 solar energy at only 1cm path length . In addition the solar thermal conversion efficiency of hybrid nanofluids increased with the mass concentration . The maximum value of solar thermal conversion efficiency was found to be 97.3 on 1wt SiC MWCNTs nanofluid at 10min which was 48.6 higher than that of pure EG . The application potentials of SiC MWCNTs hybrid nanofluids in low temperature DASCs system were presented .
