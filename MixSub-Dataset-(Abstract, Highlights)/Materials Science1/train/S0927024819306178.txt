 Nanostructured NiO as hole selective contact for perovskite solar cells is deposited on ITO from the potentiostatic anodic electrodeposition of NiOOH . Along with the large surface extension due to the honeycomb like morphology the electrodeposition route imparts different electrochemical features in respect to the classic sol gel derived NiO which are two interesting features for optoelectronic applications . CH

@highlight Anodic electrodeposition of NiO leads to nanosized and nanostructured thin film.
@highlight Perovskite solar cells are fabricated depositing CH
@highlight NH
@highlight PbI
@highlight in air.
@highlight The nanoflakes morphology of NiO enlarges the area of contact between the hole selective contact and the perovskite layer.
@highlight Efficiency above 16 and FF of 78 are obtained when depositing the NiO HSL at the higher potential.
