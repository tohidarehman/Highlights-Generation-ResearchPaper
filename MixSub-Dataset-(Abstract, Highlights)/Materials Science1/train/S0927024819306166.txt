 Silicon heterojunction solar cells achieve high conversion efficiency due to the excellent surface passivation provided by the hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon films . However they require a high quality wafer as a starting material because their low temperature processing does not allow for gettering . Czochralski grown upgraded metallurgical grade silicon is a low cost alternative to electronic grade silicon for silicon solar cells but is often limited in lifetime by grown in defects . We have previously shown that pre fabrication treatments namely

@highlight  phosphorus diffusion gettering and hydrogenation are used as pre fabrication treatments.
@highlight Pre fabrication treatments can significantly improve the bulk quality n type solar grade silicon.
@highlight Pre fabrication treatments enable SHJ solar cell technology to be applied to a low quality as grown wafers.
