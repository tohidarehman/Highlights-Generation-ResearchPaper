 Here we report a certified efficiency of up to 25.11 for silicon heterojunction solar cells on a full size n type M2 monocrystalline silicon wafer total area 244.5cm

@highlight 25.11 high efficiency silicon heterojunction solar cells on a full size n type M2 c Si wafer is obtained.
@highlight An ultra thin intrinsic a Si H buffer layer with low deposition rate shows superior surface passivation.
@highlight The ultra thin i a Si H film has both a higher microstructure factor R and H content.
@highlight The efficiency of RF PECVD prepared SHJ cell is 0.21 higher than that of VHF PECVD prepared.
