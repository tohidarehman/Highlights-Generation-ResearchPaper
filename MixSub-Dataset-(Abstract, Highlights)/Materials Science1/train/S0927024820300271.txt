 Building energy consumption is influenced evidently by solar radiation . To achieve a stable indoor temperature by minimizing the heat fluctuations resulted from solar radiation latent heat thermal energy storage systems with phase change materials in building envelope have been studied . Though inorganic PCMs have promising potential applications among all kinds of PCMs the supercooling and segregation are the major issues which have restricted their practical applications . The purpose of this study is to lessen the supercooling degree of an industrial grade PCM CaCl

@highlight The supercooling degree of CaCl
@highlight 6H
@highlight O can be reduced to less than 1C with the addition of 0.5wt flake graphite.
@highlight The addition of 25wt SAP can eliminate the segregation of CaCl
@highlight 6H
@highlight O.
@highlight The combined method of TGA DTA can evaluate the segregation of CaCl
@highlight 6H
@highlight O effectively.
@highlight Using modified CaCl
@highlight 6H
@highlight O in buildings is economically feasible with the payback period of 15 years.
