 The use of controlled inert ambient to produce hybrid perovskite solar cells makes them less competitive towards the commercialization . Herein progress is made with the preparation of hybrid perovskite CH

@highlight Homogeneous perovskite thin films can be prepared in high relative humidity ambient.
@highlight 4 Tertbutyl Pyridine in ethyl acetate as anti solvent increases the hydrophobicity of perovskite.
@highlight High efficient and stable perovskite solar cells can be produced in ambient conditions.
@highlight About 80 of retain in cell s efficiency is achieved after 6 months of storage without encapsulation.
