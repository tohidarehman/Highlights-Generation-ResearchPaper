 Metal oxides are interesting materials for use as carrier selective contacts for the fabrication of doping free silicon solar cells . In particular MoO

@highlight Thermal stability of i a Si H TiO
@highlight  Yb Ag contact was studied by annealing treatment of i a Si H and varying the Yb thickness.
@highlight Pre annealing treatment of i a Si H and thin Yb increased thermal stability of electron contact.
@highlight The pre annealing treatment effectively reduced hydrogen content in i a Si H as detected by ERD measurement.
@highlight Unique doping free cells were demonstrated and the optimal process parameter for pre annealing was obtained.
@highlight The gain in cell efficiency and thermal stability by pre annealing treatment was confirmed at a cell and at module level.
