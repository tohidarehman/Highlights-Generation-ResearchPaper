 Intrinsic defect density in polycrystalline halide perovskite films are required to be low enough to suppress charge recombination loss for improvement in performance of perovskite solar cells . In this paper we propose the use of amphoteric imidazole to achieve high crystalline quality of CH

@highlight Imidazole is doped into perovskite absorption layer for Lewis acid base adduct approach.
@highlight Crystallinities of imidazole doped perovskite is improved with large grain size.
@highlight Defect density of perovskite is also reduced by imidazole doping.
@highlight The imidazole additive could passivate the uncoordinated ions e.g. Pb
@highlight  defects.
@highlight The stability of imidazole modified perovskite films is further improved.
