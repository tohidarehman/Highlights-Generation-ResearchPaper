 Owing to overheating of electronic components during work more and more attention has been paid to the research of high thermal conductivity polymer composites in recent years . However traditional way to improve the thermal conductivity of polymer is not ideal . Here a high performance polyline folded graphite paper epoxy resin composite was prepared by using polyline folded graphite paper and liquid epoxy resin as fillers and matrix respectively . Its out of plane thermal conductivity and the improvement efficiency per 1wt are as high as 24.19 Wm

@highlight Polyline Folded graphene paper can create ultra efficient heat transfer paths.
@highlight The prepared composite has an extremely high thermal conductivity. 24.19 Wm
@highlight  .
@highlight The prepared composite is an excellent candidate for CPU heat dissipation.
@highlight The prepared composite can be initially industrialized.
