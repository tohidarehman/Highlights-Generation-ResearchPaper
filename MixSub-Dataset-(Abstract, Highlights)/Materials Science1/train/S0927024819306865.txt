 The incorporation of phase change material into the building integrated semi transparent photovoltaic system is a promising technology to regulate the enhanced surface temperature of the photovoltaic system . In this work Sodium Sulfate Decahydrate Na

@highlight The two inorganic phase change material was characterized to form Eutectic PCM.
@highlight The optimum molar ratio of 70 wt Na
@highlight SO
@highlight 10H
@highlight O and 30 wt N
@highlight Zn6H
@highlight O.
@highlight PCM improved output power of BISTPV module from 34 287W year to 37 024W year.
@highlight The new method was devised to incorporate the PCM in BISTPV modules.
