 Ethylene vinyl acetate has for decades been the material of choice for photovoltaic module encapsulation . However while it is relatively inexpensive and initially adheres well to module components EVA discolors with age andas interfacial adhesion degradesbecomes susceptible to delamination ultimately resulting in reduced module efficiency and shortened service lifetimes . As potential replacements for EVA ionomer thermoplastic materials cure faster are more resistant to discoloration and potential induced degradation and do not evolve corrosive acetic acid making them compatible with new device materials such as perovskites . Since there is limited information on ionomer durability for PV module applications a series of field and accelerated laboratory aging studies were conducted to assess ionomer interface stability in the presence of terrestrial environmental stressors . It is shown that adhesion to the glass and cell interfaces of PV modules is inferior to EVA both before and after aging rendering ionomers particularly susceptible to delamination after short timeframes . Potential solutions to improve ionomer adhesion are discussed .

@highlight Ionomer thermoplastics were examined as a viable alternative to EVA for PV module encapsulation.
@highlight Ionomer adhesion to the glass and cell interfaces of PV modules is inferior to EVA.
@highlight Surface preparation and functionalization processes should be investigated to improve adhesion.
