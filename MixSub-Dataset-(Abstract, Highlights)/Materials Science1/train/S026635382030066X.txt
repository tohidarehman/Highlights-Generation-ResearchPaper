 A hierarchical multiscale model is established to reveal the failure mechanism of three dimensional braided composites at high temperature . Firstly the tensile and bending tests of the composites were performed at three different temperatures and the properties of microscale constituents i.e . carbon fiber epoxy resin and interface were also calibrated by experiments at different temperatures . Then the elastic plastic damage constitutive laws were proposed to characterize the mechanical behavior of microscale and mesoscale components . These constitutive models were implemented by a user defined subroutine UMAT in ABAQUS . Finally based on the homogenization procedure and the multiscale analysis method the effects of temperature on microscale mesoscale and macroscale properties of 3D braided composites were analyzed sequentially . The results showed that the temperature has the significant effects on the performances of 3D braided composites . With the increase of temperature the properties of 3D braided composites decreased and the failure modes changed from fiber breakage to matrix plastic deformation . Besides the macroscopic simulation of strain fields agreed well with the DIC measurements and the temperature dependent failure modes agreed well with SEM observation . It is expected that the established multiscale framework can predict high temperature behavior of 3D braided composites and reveal the different failure mechanisms at different temperatures .
