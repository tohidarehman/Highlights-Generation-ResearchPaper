 Passivating contacts are an important technological innovation for crystalline silicon solar cells that can deliver efficiencies of over 24 in mass production . In this study we comprehensively analyze

@highlight Poly Si based passivating contacts result in lower recombination current densities hence higher cell voltages.
@highlight Doped poly Si layers lead to parasitic absorption. Thinner layers can boost cell current and hence efficiencies.
@highlight Screen printed fire through metallization enabler for mass production fire through metallization partially degrades passivation.
@highlight Gain of 0.3 mA cm
@highlight observed by reducing 100 nm poly Si from 250 nm to 150 nm while maintaining the passivating properties.
@highlight  0.5 absolute increase in efficiency observed by reducing 100 nm poly Si from 250 nm to 150 nm best cell efficiency 22.1 .
