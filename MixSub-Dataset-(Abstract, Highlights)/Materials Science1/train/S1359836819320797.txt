 The alkoxysilane isocyanate terminated polyurethane was prepared as bio adhesive . For this purpose a bio polyol was synthesized and modified by epoxidized soybean oil and tetra ethyl ortho silicate respectively . In the following this modified bio polyol was reacted with polymeric 4 4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate to form the bio adhesive . The performance of the bio adhesive was improved by using zinc oxide nanoparticles ZnO NP
