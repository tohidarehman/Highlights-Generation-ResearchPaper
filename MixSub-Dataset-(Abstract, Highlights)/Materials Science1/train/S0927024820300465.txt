 In this study we used computational and experimental studies to understand a halide vapor phase epitaxy reactor for growing Gallium Antimonide Phosphide GaSb

@highlight HVPE model of GaSbP deposition comprised gas phase and gas solid kinetics.
@highlight Process optimization enhanced the crystallinity and composition of GaSbP alloys.
@highlight This work contributes to developing affordable synthesis methods of III V alloys.
@highlight GaSbP over performs sulfur doped GaP regarding onset and fill factor of J V curves.
@highlight Photocurrents of GaSbP alloys show good potential for unassisted water splitting.
