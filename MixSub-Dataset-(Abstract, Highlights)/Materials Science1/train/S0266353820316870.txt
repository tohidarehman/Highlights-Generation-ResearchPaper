 Composites of conducting polymers and single walled carbon nanotubes are promising thermoelectric materials but require further performance enhancement for practical application . Inspired by the improved compatibility between conducting polymer and small molecule dopants via polar side chain modification we propose in this work a high performance composite comprising polar side chain engineered conducting polymer and SWCNT . In detail two kinds of polythiophene SWCNT composites bearing different side chains called poly and poly ethoxy 2 5 diyl were prepared and composited with SWCNT . Molecular simulations revealed that compared with P3HT PMEET bearing polar side chains has better backbone planarity and a narrower band gap with a less deep HOMO level . These properties led to enhanced interactions between PMEET and SWCNT evidenced by UVvis absorption and Raman spectroscopies . The optimized PMEET SWCNT composite film showed a high electrical conductivity of 699Scm

@highlight Polythiophenes with different side chains P3HT and PMEET were prepared.
@highlight Strong interaction between polythiophene with polar side chain and SWCNT was proved.
@highlight The PF value of PMEET SWCNT composites reaches up to 121Wm
@highlight The PF value of PMEET SWCNT composite is twice that of P3HT SWCNT composite.
