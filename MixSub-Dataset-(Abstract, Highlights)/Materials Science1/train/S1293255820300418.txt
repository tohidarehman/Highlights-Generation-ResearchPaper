 Nano sized CuO thin films were deposited onto glass substrate using the chemical spray pyrolysis method . These films were characterized using the x ray diffraction Raman spectroscopy and UVvisible spectroscopy . The characterization results were investigated as a function of the spray number . According to the XRD patterns all the deposited films were polycrystalline monoclinic CuO . The XRD result was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy . The lattice parameters remains mainly constant and the oriented crystallite size increased from 4 to 6nm . From the transmittance spectra the band gap energy decreased from 2.14 to 1.85eV and the mean transmittance between 400 and 800nm decreased from 35 to 5 . The decrease of the band gap energy as a function of the increasing crystallite size was explained by the quantum confinement effect .

@highlight CuO films were deposited by chemical spray pyrolysis.
@highlight The direct formation of CuO was confirmed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy.
@highlight The crystallite size was less than 6nm.
@highlight The band gap energy decreased with the increasing crystallite size.
@highlight The decrease of the band gap energy was interpreted by the quantum size effect.
