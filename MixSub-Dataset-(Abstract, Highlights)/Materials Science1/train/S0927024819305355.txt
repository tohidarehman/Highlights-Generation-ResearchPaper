 Photovoltaic energy yield loss due to solar module soiling has become increasingly important as solar module deployment is now at the hundreds of gigawatts scale and continues to grow rapidly . The electrostatic attraction and adhesion force F

@highlight Designed direct measurement of electrostatic adhesion and attraction forces F
@highlight  on dust particles.
@highlight Found that F
@highlight is 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than other physical adsorption forces dominating the adhesion forces.
@highlight Found that the most important factor for long lasting F
@highlight after sunset is charges in either dust particle or solar module.
@highlight Found how the connection of solar array to ground is a dominant factor for lasting and decay of F
@highlight The F
@highlight and its decay are understood in terms of net charge interactions dipole dipole and charge dipole interactions.
