 The reinforcing and synergistic effect of a 1D filler and of a 2D filler in a high amorphous vinyl alcohol polymer has been investigated . Nanocomposite films have been obtained by dissolving in water the HAVOH polymer and suitable fillers thus leading to the formation of a very promising material for eco friendly food packaging applications . In addition the effect of trimethoxysilane as crosslinking agents for the vinylalchol based polymer has been studied . FTIR and XPS results clearly show that the presence of mercapto silane has a twofold effect . Mercapto groups have the capability to reduce chemically the graphene oxide filler to reduced graphene oxide during the preparation of the HAVOH based composites and to crosslink the HAVOH structure . Tensile tests show that the effect of siloxane crosslinking leads to an embrittlement of the HAVOH matrix which is avoided when rGO e cellulose nanocrystals are dispersed in the composites . The permeability results show that all the composites exhibit better barrier properties than pristine HAVOH . Particularly the highest water permeability reduction of about 45 is observed for the sample containing 1 wt wt GO and 1 wt wt CNC . This significant drop in permeability is likely related to three concurrent effects a the crosslinking of HAVOH matrix b the binding of water molecules due to CNC presence and c the more hydrophobic behaviour associated to a high amount of rGO .
