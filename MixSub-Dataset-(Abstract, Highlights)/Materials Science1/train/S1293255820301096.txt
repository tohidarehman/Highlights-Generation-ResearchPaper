 This is the first report of the atomic scale structure in iron oxides carbonates based composites produced at various autoclave temperatures from divalent Fe precursor . It is also one of the first works which demonstrates how EXAFS simulation can be utilized to additionally characterize metal compound based materials to estimate their properties associated with surface reactivity . Here we examine how greatly the autoclave temperature within a practical range of 120180C affects the composition structure surface chemistry and adsorptive anion removal of three Fe oxides carbonates built composites synthesized via urea supported hydrothermal precipitation . Divalent Fe precursor was used to promote redox transformations and consequently to increase number of phases compounds . Complementary tools EXAFS XPS and FTIR allowed to characterize the entire composites regardless of their crystallinity . It was defined that the autoclave temperature strongly influenced both the ratios between two substances in each material and speciation in each compound . Stronger reducing conditions at higher temperature in autoclave intensified generation of FeCO
