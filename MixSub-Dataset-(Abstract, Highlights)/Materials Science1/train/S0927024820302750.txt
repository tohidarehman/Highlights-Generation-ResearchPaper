 Simple co precipitation method followed by calcination was adopted to synthesize ZnCdSO ternary semiconductor photocatalyst . In the composite material highly crystalline and hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO along with hexagonal CdS and cubic CdO phases were separately identified . Oxygen vacancies V

@highlight ZnCdSO ternary composite photocatalyst synthesized via co precipitation and calcination at 300
@highlight Highly crystalline hexagonal ZnO and CdS with cubic CdO phase co exist in the composite matrix.
@highlight in ZnO network and CdO phase induce to narrow the band gap and increase visible light absorption.
@highlight CdSCdO phase mediated surface defect acts as charge carrier trap site and active site for dye adsorption.
@highlight Photocatalytic dye degradation plausibly occurs via double Z scheme charge transfer mechanism.
