 The current loss is mainly due to the reflection and the parasitic absorption in the indium tin oxide and amorphous silicon in the front side of silicon heterojunction solar cells . In this paper we implemented n type hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxide n c SiO

@highlight The phosphorus treatment promoted crystallization of the microcrystalline silicon front surface layers of SHJ solar cells.
@highlight The effects of phosphorus treatment in seed layer on the front surface layers and cells parameters were investigated.
@highlight The performance of SHJ solar cells with amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon front surface layers was compared.
@highlight An efficiency of 23.87 242.5cm
@highlight  and J
@highlight  39.19mA cm
@highlight for SHJ solar cell was achieved.
