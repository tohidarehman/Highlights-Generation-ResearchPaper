 In this study a novel hindered phenol antioxidant with thioether and carboxy groups and its samarium complex were employed as an interfacial modifier for styrene butadiene rubber silica SBR SiO

@highlight A novel hindered phenol antioxidant GMMP and its rare earth complex Sm GMMP were prepared and studied as modifier for SBR SiO
@highlight composites.
@highlight Both GMMP and Sm GMMP could effectively improve the dispersion of filler the rubber filler interfacial interaction and the final mechanical properties.
@highlight SBR SiO
@highlight composites modified by Sm GMMP revealed the better static and dynamic mechanical properties than those modified with same content of GMMP.
