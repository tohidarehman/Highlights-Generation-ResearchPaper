 DPP based conjugated polymers exhibit a broad optical absorption and high motilities for hole and electron all of which will be advantageous to high photocurrents and good fill factors in OPV . However their power conversion efficiency still lag behind other polymer donor materials . In order to understand the reason hindering the PCE improvement it is especially important to reveal the underlying electronic processes in Donor Acceptor blending active layer . Through optical pump terahertz probe investigation we found that the combination of fast exciton separation and long carrier lifetime will convenient to optic electricity conversion efficiency . Although high charge mobility lead to long carrier lifetime the difficulty of exciton separation in narrow band gap polymer DPPDTT is a key factor affecting device efficiency .

@highlight The PCE have close relationship with the exciton lifetime for different blending ratio of DPPDTT PCBM film the shorter exciton lifetime the higher PCE will be.
@highlight The carrier lifetime in DPPDTT PCBM blending film is very long up to 14.58ps which suggests that the charge mobility in DPPDTT PCBM film is much larger than that of P3HT PCBM and PTB7 PCBM blending films which is convenient to the PCE of OPV devices.
