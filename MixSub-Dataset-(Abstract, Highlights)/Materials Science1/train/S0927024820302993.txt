 Sub ambient radiative cooling has been achieved recently by applying advanced nanofabrication technologies which attracts extensive research attention due to its passive cooling characteristic . Water condensation is an important application of radiative cooling which is also an unconventional technology for gaining fresh water without consuming energy . However limited efforts have been devoted to improving the water harvesting using the state of the art radiative cooling materials . To efficiently accomplish dew condensation by radiative cooling we first take a theoretical approach to analyze the weather conditions for effective dew condensation . Then we propose the durable enhance specular reflector metal by 3M Company as an efficient material for dew condensation and further improve its dew condensation performance through a simple hydrophilic coating . The dew condensation performance shows significant enhancement over the previously used polytetrafluororoethylene radiative condenser . On site experiment result shows that the hydrophilic DESR M can achieve lowest cooling temperature among all the three samples . The dew yield improves by 72.7 and 88.1 compared to DESR M and PTFE respectively .
