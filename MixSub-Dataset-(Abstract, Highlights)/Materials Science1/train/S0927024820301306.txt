 Interfacial engineering is an effective method to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells . Nevertheless it is still challenging to find a material as interfacial layer with the dual function of defect passivation and efficient charge transfer . In this work organophosphorus ligands trioctylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphine oxide were used as passivators through antisolvent process for the interfacial modification . Significantly the organophosphorus ligands can effectively passivate the defects of perovskite crystals through the formation of PbO bond between organophosphorus ligand and undercoordinated Pb

@highlight Benzene rings with electron in triphenylphosphine oxide facilitate the charge transfer between perovskite and HTL.
@highlight The device with organophosphorus ligand modification yielded a highest PCE of 18.29 and excellent long term stability.
