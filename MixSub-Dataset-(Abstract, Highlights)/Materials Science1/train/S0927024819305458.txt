 A 50 layer stacked InGaAs GaAs quantum dot solar cell grown on GaAs with a self organized texture formed on its backside has been fabricated in aim for enhancing the photoabsorption by the QD layers . Since doped GaAs substrate has a large free carrier absorption a semi insulating substrate was used for fabricating the QDSC with backside texture . A micrometer scale texture was formed by a simple wet etching in a NH
