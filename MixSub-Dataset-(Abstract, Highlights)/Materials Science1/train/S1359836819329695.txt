 Cytosine pyrophosphate was prepared by using pyrophosphoric acid and cytosine . The structure morphology and thermal stability of PPA C were analyzed by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis . The PPA C was used as acid and gas source and pentaerythritol as charring agent to form an intumescent flame retardant system which was applied to improve the flame retardancy of polypropylene . The flame retardancy and thermal degradation behaviors of PP IFR composites were investigated by vertical combustion limiting oxygen index and cone calorimeter TGA etc . The PPA C and PER have good synergistic effects on improving the flame retardancy of PP which is better than that of commercial ammonium polyphosphate and PER system . The PP IFR composites with 18wt PPA C PER achieves the UL 94 V 0 rating and a LOI value of 28.8vol . The PPA C reacts with PER to form P O C and P C during combustion which helps the formation of intumescent char layer . In addition the IFR makes PP degrade in advance and form more char residues at high temperature . Proper ratio and amount of PPA C PER promotes the formation of intumescent char layer without defects during combustion reduces the heat release rate and delays the thermal degradation of PP composites thus improves the flame retardancy of PP .

@highlight A bio based flame retardant PPA C was prepared by using pyrophosphatic acid PPA and cytosine C .
@highlight UL 94 V0 rating is achieved for PP composites with 13.5wt PPA C and 4.5wt PER.
@highlight PPA C PER promotes the formation of intumescent char layer without defects.
