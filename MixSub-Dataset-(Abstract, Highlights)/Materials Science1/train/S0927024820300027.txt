 High temperature cooking operations like frying roasting and baking using solar energy are normally carried out at the focus of parabolic dish concentrators . This leads to heat discomfort risk of burns or eye damage to the user . A device which stores latent heat in a phase changing eutectic mixture called solar salt was designed and tested which would enable its storage in an insulated container and cooking in the shade of a kitchen when needed . It was able to successfully store heat at its melting point of 220C in a charging time of 110min . Frying temperature of 170 180C for the oil was easily obtained during indoor cooking and 0.25kg of potato chips were fried in 17min from one charge of heat while a total of about 0.6kg of rice was cooked in two successive batches from one charge taking 20min each .

@highlight Solar salt good phase change heat storage material for high temperature cooking.
@highlight One charge of solar heat stored in less than 2h.
@highlight Rice can be cooked easily from stored heat.
@highlight Frying potato chips in oil at 170C achieved.
