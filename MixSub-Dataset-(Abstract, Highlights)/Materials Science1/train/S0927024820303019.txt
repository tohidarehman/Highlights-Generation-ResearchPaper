 Degradation of the encapsulation of solar modules is a crucial problem and accordingly tools for assessing and understanding the according degradation is an important research topic . Here we suggest near infrared absorption spectroscopy as a tool that has a strong potential to determine non invasively the composition of encapsulant and backsheet in typical commercial solar modules . Correct polymer identification by NIRA was supported by Raman spectral microscopy of the backsheet air sides and cross sections with a hundred solar modules of different manufacturers analyzed by both spectroscopic methods . Furthermore a specific NIRA measurement regime of the ethylene vinyl acetate encapsulant is presented which potentially allows to probe the composition of the encapsulant non destructively under lab conditions but also on silicon solar modules in the field installed outdoors . The present report shows NIRA to be a powerful method for non destructive analysis of backsheets and encapsulants of photovoltaic silicon modules .
