 In the present study the ternary CuNiPt alloy nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the graphenized pencil lead electrode surface and the obtained modified electrode was examined as a new electrocatalyst towards ethanol electro oxidation reaction . The GPLE was fabricated through the electrochemical exfoliation of pencil lead electrode in acidic condition on a three electrode electrochemical cell . The physicochemical and electrocatalytic characterizations of the prepared electrocatalyst were examined by means of various techniques X ray powder diffraction spectroscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy elemental mapping analysis cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry . Comparison of the electrocatalytic activity of the introduced electrocatalysts showed that the CuNiPt ANPs GPLE has the highest and good electrocatalytic activity first anodic peak current density 101mAcm
