 Physicochemical properties of copper aluminum and cadmium oxides determine their application in different ways . Electrochemical metal oxidation using alternating current influences the band gap of prepared copper containing oxide materials and result in a blue shift . The use of alternating current provides sufficient conditions responsible for nanosized materials formation . In the present work XRD and DSC DTG SEM analyses were used to characterize the electrolysis products . A decrease of the thermal transformation temperature Cu

@highlight Nano sized particles are formed by non equilibrium electrochemical metal oxidation.
@highlight AC electrolysis decreased the temperature at which phase transformation of the products occur.
@highlight Layered double hydroxides are formed by carbonization of Cu and Al electrolysis products.
