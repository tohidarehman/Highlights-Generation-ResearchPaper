 Control of film s properties is the most important for providing of customized electronic devices . In particular when the nanocomposite networks are applied to the films for needs of various applications the quality of film is considered as one of the most potent factors . Here we propose a viable and facile method of controlling the silver nanowire elastomer nanocomposite networks through elaborate direct printing for implementing sandwich structured ultrathin and stretchable strain sensors . According to the different Ag NW network densities controlled by various blade coating parameters surface morphological characteristics optical transmittance and currentvoltage performance were investigated . In order to exhibit the importance of network density control to electronic devices we fabricated two stretchable strain sensors with different sensitivities R R
