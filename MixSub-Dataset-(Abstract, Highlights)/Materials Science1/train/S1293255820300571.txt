 Lithium niobate and potassium niobate crystals of near stoichiometric composition were grown with the help of the Czochralski method with liquid and ceramic charging . Birefringence of the grown lithium niobate sample is n 1.5at 1THz frequency pleochroism in absorption on 1THz frequency makes preferable the using of the extraordinary wave because of the lower absorption coefficient 14cm
