 A novel and efficient protocol for tandem oxidative amidation of alcohols to amides with copper modified well ordered mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride Cu g C

@highlight Cu g C
@highlight was synthesized through facile in situ immobilization of Cu II on the porous g C
@highlight from low cost cyanamide.
@highlight Cu g C
@highlight was applied as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for one pot tandem oxidative amidation reaction.
@highlight Cu g C
@highlight showed impressive catalytic activity for the synthesis of various amide derivatives.
@highlight The Cu g C
@highlight was recycled several times without copper leaching and loss in its activity.
