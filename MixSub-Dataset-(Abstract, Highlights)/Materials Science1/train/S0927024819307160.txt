 A novel method of microcosmic visualizing was employed in investigating the supercooling stability of a phase change material . The supercooling behavior of the PCM under circumstances of different surface free energy was studied both dynamically and statically and a theory analysis of how the surface free energy of the substrate affects the stable supercooling of PCM was carried out . The results showed that the PCM droplets phase changed after a 20 cm free fall on substrate with larger surface free energy while remained supercooled on substrate with lower surface free energy . The PCM in PTFE container initiated crystallization at 8.99C withstood over 400 on hours at liquid state compared with the sample in glass container while a large supercooling degree of over 57C was achieved . It indicated that containers made of materials with lower surface free energy could be considerably beneficial in stabilizing supercooling of PCMs which could give a guide to the practical application on long term energy storage of PCMs . What is more the surface free energy theory also works on the air liquid interface . The oil covered PCM sample withstood a temperature of 5C for 10 months without crystalized in a refrigerator showing great potential on supercooling stabilization .
