 In the present work the influence of pH on the microstructure and magnetic properties of pure and doped ZnO nanoparticles with Fe is reported . Specifically we synthesize nanoparticles using the sol gel method with pH 3 6 and 9 . For pure ZnO it is verified that the lattice constants crystallite size lattice strain dislocation density

@highlight Pure and Fe doped ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by the sol gel method
@highlight The structural and magnetic properties are dependent of the pH value
@highlight ZnO samples show paramagnetism in combination with typical diamagnetism
