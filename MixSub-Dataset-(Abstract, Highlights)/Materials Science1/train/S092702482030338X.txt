 Dynamic radiative cooling with variable emissive power is experimentally demonstrated in this study by a wavelength selective tunable metafilm emitter which consists of an opaque aluminum film a sputtered silicon spacer and a thermochromic vanadium dioxide VO

@highlight A wavelength selective emitter based on thermochromic VO
@highlight is fabricated by thin film deposition and furnace oxidation.
@highlight Temperature dependent measurements show a high emittance peak near 10m wavelength when VO
@highlight changes from insulator to metal.
@highlight The tunable metafilm emitter achieves a large increase in total emittance from 0.11at room temperature to 0.58at 100C.
@highlight Theoretical modeling shows that the high temperature emission enhancement is due to Fabry Perot resonance with metallic VO
@highlight Enhanced thermal emission is experimentally demonstrated with a calorimetry based thermal vacuum experiment.
