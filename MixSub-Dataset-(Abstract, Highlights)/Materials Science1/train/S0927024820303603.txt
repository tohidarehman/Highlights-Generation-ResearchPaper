 Select emerging solar cell technologies ranging from very narrow screen printed fingers to perovskite silicon tandems would benefit from a reduction of the height of the standard pyramidal texture of monocrystalline silicon wafers to below 1m . However fabricating such small surface features usually compromises the requisite low reflectance and high passivation quality . Through systematic design of experiments we demonstrate that conventional alkaline based wet chemical etching processes can be tuned to produce dense spatially homogeneous and uniformly sized sub micrometer pyramids . Precise texture size can be further controlled by adding potassium silicate to the texturing solution to effectively slow the pyramid growth rate and promote nucleation . With pyramid size distribution dataextracted from multiple atomic force microscopy images across each waferwe demonstrate 16 nanotextures with average pyramid sizes ranging from 62 to 512nm with the largest having only 0.3 of its pyramids taller than 1m . Six of the nanotextures exhibit light trapping and surface defect densities comparable to state of the art microtextured wafers . The best nanotexture achieved an AM1.5G weighted reflectance of 11.8 and a minority carrier lifetime of 3.4ms after passivation with amorphous silicon demonstrating that smaller textures need not deteriorate solar cell performance .
