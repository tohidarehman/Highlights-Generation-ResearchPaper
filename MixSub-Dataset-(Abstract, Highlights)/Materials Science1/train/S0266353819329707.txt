 The development of materials with excellent mechanical properties and stem cell affinity for bone repair is a topic that has received significant interest in the field of bone tissue engineering . In this study stereocomplex poly based composite nanofiber membranes that are compatible with bone marrow stem cells were prepared with poly

@highlight Decoupled homocrystallites HCs and stereocomplexed crystallites SCs at 80C.
@highlight Prepared nanofibers with highly dispersed hydroxyapatite HA .
@highlight Composite nanofiber membranes exhibited enhanced mechanical properties and increased melting temperature.
@highlight The composite nanofiber membrane exhibited an improved osteogenic differentiation.
