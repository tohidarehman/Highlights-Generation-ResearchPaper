 Hole transport layer is important in inverted perovskite solar cells to facilitate the hole extraction and suppress the charge recombination for high device performance . Based on the widely used HTL material of poly poly we proposed a new HTL modification method using the widely available copper thiocyanate the doping of CuSCN NH

@highlight The first attempt to fabricate PEDOT PSS CuSCN HTL improves both the stability and efficiency of the inverted PSCs.
@highlight This new HTLimproves PSC performance with open current voltage over 1.0V and power conversion efficiency PCE up to 15.3 .
@highlight Impedance spectra demonstrate that PEDOT PSS CuSCN HTL could improve charge extraction efficiency .
@highlight With reduced acidity the PEDOT PSS CuSCN HTL enables excellent long term stability of the inverted PSCs.
