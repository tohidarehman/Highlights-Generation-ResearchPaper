 A novel herbal electrochromic device has been fabricated using raw hibiscus flower extract and its performance parameters have been studied . With no usage of any chemical to obtain extracts of herbal hibiscus flower is in itself a safe economic way and a first such demonstration . Optical and electrochemical properties of the herbal extract have been studied using optical absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies . The Cyclic Voltammetry curves of the extracted solution shows reversible redox activity with overall reducing behaviour corresponding to less than a volt . The redox induced color switching properties of the solution is studied by monitoring the spectral changes in its as prepared and chemically reduced forms . The color change when mimicked using dynamic doping can also be achieved to form a solid state electrochromic device . Performance of such a fabricated device has been studied in terms of its color modulation switching speed and cyclability . This demonstrates the first herbal electrochromic device using natural ingredients which leads the way to have better performing sustainable and environment friendly devices .
