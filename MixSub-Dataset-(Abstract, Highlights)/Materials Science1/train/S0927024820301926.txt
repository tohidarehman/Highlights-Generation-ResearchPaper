 Microencapsulated phase change materials with carbon nanotube enhanced fillers and binary cores which exhibit improved thermal conductivity and an adjustable working temperature range are highly desirable for various heat energy storage applications . However degraded properties are usually found for the CNT enhanced MPCMs due to the poor compatibility of CNTs with PCMs and the existing types of binary core MPCMs are quite limited . Herein we prepared a novel type of BCMPCM with a

@highlight Carbon nanotubes CNTs were successfully grafted with octadecyl isocyanate.
@highlight Alkylation of the CNTs substantially improved their compatibility with organic PCM.
@highlight Alkylated CNT incorporated binary core MPCMs BCMPCMs were fabricated.
@highlight The thermal transfer rate of BCMPCMs was enhanced by the alkylated CNTs.
@highlight The CNT decorated BCMPCMs demonstrate outstanding temperature regulation ability.
