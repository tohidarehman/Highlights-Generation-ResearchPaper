 Aluminium first surface plastic mirrors have been developed to be used as heliostats in concentrated solar power stations . The Al reflective layer the adhesion of the reflective layer to the polycarbonate substrate and the protective over coat have all been optimized in order to achieve a highly reflective robust and durable light weight mirror . The Al layers were deposited by means of magnetron sputtering and the change in reflectance was investigated as a result of variations in the sputtering conditions . The influence of the substrate cleaning process and the addition of an interfacial seed layer on the adhesion of the reflective layer were also systematically studied . A thick sputtered SiO

@highlight Aluminium first surface mirrors have been developed on polycarbonate substrates.
@highlight The mirror consists of 10nm of SiO
@highlight  80nm of Al and 4.5m of a hard coat resin.
@highlight The SR was maintained after 5 months under outdoor and accelerated weathering tests.
@highlight The mirrors are resistant to abrasion and to corrosion 40 days in salt spray .
