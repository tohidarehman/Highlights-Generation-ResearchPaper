 Covalent organic framework is a designable and versatile platform for preparation of various functional materials including conventional gas adsorption and separation materials catalysis matrix and photoelectric materials etc . The covalent organic framework with redox building block and conjugated molecular structure can be viewed as a conjugated polymer with ordered porous structure . In this paper we synthesized a Schiff base type conjugated organic framework by a solvothermal method in a common Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave . The reversible reaction of dynamic imine bonds in solvothermal process induces the morphology transform of COF from nanoparticle to nanofiber . Besides of its structure morphology nanofiber formation mechanism and electrochemical properties the electrochromic properties of COF were investigated for the first time . Owing to the redox building block of triphenylamine the COF possesses reversibly electrochromic behavior caused by reversibly redox reaction and band gap change of triphenylamine unit . Under step potentials between 2.5V and 2.5V the COF can switch between bright yellow color and brown color . The stability test shows that the device can reversibly switch with stable contrast after slight decay at the initiated cycles . In consideration of abundant options of building units with redox feature the COF based electrochromic materials with rich color and novel properties can be expected .
