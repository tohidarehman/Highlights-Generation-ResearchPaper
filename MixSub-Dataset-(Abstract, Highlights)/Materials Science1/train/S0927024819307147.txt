 A series of composite phase change materials are fabricated through the one pot method with the epoxidized methoxy polyethylene glycol as the thermal energy unit and polydopamine reduced graphene oxide nanosheets as the interfacial enhancement . Structure and thermal properties such as phase change enthalpy thermal repeatability and light to thermal conversion capacity of EmPEG PDA rGO cPCMs with PDA rGO content varying from 0.5 to 4wt have been detailed discussed . A superior stabilization performance of EmPEG PDA rGO cPCMs to pristine EmPEG is demonstrated based on the interfacial action from the incorporated PDA rGO nanosheets . EmPEG PDA rGO 3 presents good structure stabilized behavior after 100 heating cooling cycles and no liquid leakage appears up to 105C . In the meantime EmPEG PDA rGO 3 illustrates a stable thermal reliability and thermal charging discharging rate and the light to thermal conversion efficiency reaches 96 under the 100mW cm
