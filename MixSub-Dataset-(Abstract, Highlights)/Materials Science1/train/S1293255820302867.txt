 In the current article it is described the preparation of a natural polymeric material formed by chitosan and a complex for application as voltammetric sensor for isoniazid using a carbon paste electrode . The material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy infrared spectroscopy X Ray diffraction and Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy . The CuFeCHT voltammetric behavior was achieved using a GPE which showed two redox couples with formal potential E

@highlight Chitosan was used as a material support for copper hexacyanoferrate II particles.
@highlight A simple and easy route of synthesis was performed without further modifications on chitosan structure.
@highlight The formed material as an electrochemical sensor for isoniazid drug determination.
@highlight Low limit detection was achieved using cyclic voltammetry and square wave techniques.
@highlight This method was applied for isoniazid detection in synthetic urine samples.
