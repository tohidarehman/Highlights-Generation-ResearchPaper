 Poly is one of the promising hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells . Highly efficient PTAA devices have been demonstrated in both direct and inverted architectures . In the inverted structures the device suffers from poor coverage of the perovskite film over the hydrophobic PTAA surface . To address this issue we exploited an easy and efficient approach utilizing a short time UV treatment of the PTAA layer prior to the perovskite deposition . The UV treatment improved the optical properties of PTAA layers which synergistically helps the light harvesting of the perovskite . Enhanced grain sizes together with the decrease of recombination centers in the UV treated dopant free PTAA lead to efficient perovskite solar cell with PCE reaching 19.17 for 0.09cm
