 In this work electrochromic polymer exfoliated graphene silver nanowires composite film on indium tin oxide substrate is prepared and further assembled into the electrochromic device . We investigate the performance bleaching and coloration kinetics of device based on the composite film using polythiothene as model polymer . The results indicate that the ECD based on PT EG AgNWs ITO possesses large optical contrast high coloration efficiency 234 cm

@highlight PT EG AgNWs composite film coated electrode was fabricated for polymer based ECD.
@highlight The ECD exhibited a large optical contrast high coloration efficiency and fast response time.
@highlight The bleaching and coloration kinetics of ECD based on PT ITO or PT EG AgNWs ITO were investigated by the Avrami model.
@highlight The EC dynamic processes of device were divided into three parts and the rate constants in stage II were obtained.
