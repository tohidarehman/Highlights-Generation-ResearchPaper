 Microwave absorbers with strong absorption broad bandwidth thin thickness and low filler loading are highly desirable in electromagnetic absorption field . In this work ferroferric oxidecarbon reduced graphene oxide Fe

@highlight Fe
@highlight C RGO nanocomposites derived from Fe based MOFs were facilely fabricated.
@highlight Carbon frameworks with octahedral morphology were loaded on the surfaces of RGO.
@highlight Additive amounts of GO and filler loadings had influence on microwave absorption.
@highlight The relationship between refection loss and filler loading was carefully clarified.
@highlight Strong absorption broad bandwidth thin thickness and low loading were achieved.
