 This paper concerns the development of a metal composite containing aluminium as phase change material and alumina as structural supporting material by the cold compression hot sintering approach . The microstructural characteristics thermal and mechanical properties and thermal performance of the proposed composite are characterized . For comparison a salt composite made of NaLiCO

@highlight An aluminium based form stable composite PCM was prepared by CCHS approach.
@highlight Thermal properties of the composite was compared with a salt based composite.
@highlight Proposed composite achieved better performance than the salt composite.
@highlight 45 SSM gave composite best combination of thermal and mechanical properties.
@highlight Proposed composite can be a promising alternative for high temperature TES.
