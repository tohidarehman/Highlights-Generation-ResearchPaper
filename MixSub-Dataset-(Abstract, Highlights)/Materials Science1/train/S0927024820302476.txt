 Storing energy as heat at temperatures above 200C is necessary for both efficient industrial processes and continuous solar energy generation . In this study composite shape stabilized phase change materials were obtained using mesoporous silica as matrix and the NaNO

@highlight Mesoporous silica MSN acts as matrix for NaNO
@highlight KNO
@highlight eutectic mixture.
@highlight Shape stabilized phase change materials containing MSN and molten salt eutectic.
@highlight Distinct melting crystallization evens for interparticle and bulk salt phases.
@highlight Pore diameter above 6nm required for good thermal energy storage.
