 Modelling of solar radiation propagation and absorption in porous media is a crucial part in the modelling of porous volumetric receivers in concentrated solar power plants . The radiative properties of the porous media should be known in detail for accurate receiver modelling . In this work an experimental study and a numerical model are combined aiming to estimate the asymmetry factor of Henyey Greenstein scattering phase function in the visible spectral range for porous volumetric receivers made of open cell silicon carbide ceramic foam . For the experimental the hemispherical diffuse reflectance of five different samples is measured using a collimated light source and an integrating sphere . For the numerical modelling an algorithm based on a three dimensional Monte Carlo Ray Tracing method was developed to simulate radiation propagation and absorption in porous media for the same conditions of the experimental apparatus . The asymmetry factor is determined by adjusting its value in the numerical model in order to minimize the difference between measured and simulated values . Results show that the solar radiation scattering in open cell SiC ceramic foams is slightly backwards being the optimum asymmetry factor of the Henyey Greenstein phase function approximately
