 With the increasing demand for preparing energy storage devices composites containing metal oxides have been widely developed and used as supercapacitors . However the electrochemical performances of such materials are unable to be satisfied owing to the inherent poor conductivity . Herein we employ in situ pyrolysis approach to fabricate composite electrode materials without binding agents which are obtained by the direct calcination of the mixture MnO

@highlight An efficient binder free electrode has been prepared simply through in situ pyrolysis approach.
@highlight The electrodes prepared by different methods result in different performances.
@highlight The performance of binder free electrodes are better than those of electrodes prepared by conventional electrodes.
@highlight A flexible symmetric supercapacitor device exhibits an areal capacitance of 100.5mFcm
