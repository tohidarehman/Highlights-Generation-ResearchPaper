 Inverted perovskite solar cells based on poly poly have drawn great attention due to their potential for foldable photovoltaic applications . Modification of the interface of PEDOT PSS and perovskite layer is one of the approaches for improving the efficiency and stability . Here we introduce a triphenylamine based small molecule N N Bis N N bis phenyl 4 4 diamine into the device as the multifunctional buffer layer . It is noted that the NPB buffer layer can obviously reduce the pinholes and defects of perovskite film and adjust the energy level mismatch between perovskite and PEDOT PSS layer . Moreover the carrier recombination of NPB modified device is restricted due to the reduced defects in perovskite layer and at PEDOT PSS perovskite interface . As a result the device power conversion efficiency is improved from 15.4 to 18.4 . The flexible devices are further fabricated with the best efficiency of 14.4 without hysteresis . Most importantly due to the superior moisture and UV light resistance of NPB the modified device exhibits excellent long term stability under ambient atmosphere and UV light soaking .
