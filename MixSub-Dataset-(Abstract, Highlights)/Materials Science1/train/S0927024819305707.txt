 The development of thermal conductive and porous supporting scaffolds is believed to solve the problems of poor shape stability and low thermal conductivity of solid liquid transition type phase change materials which are promisingly used for solar thermal energy storage and management . In this paper textile structured carbon scaffolds with flexible shape and high porosity are produced by the direct carbonization of cotton cloth . The carbon textile with versatilely changeable shape can be employed as good conductive and supporting scaffolds for PCMs and paraffin PCM is evaluated . The composite PCMs exhibit good shape stability and enhanced thermal transfer properties . The composites can present anisotropically improved thermal conductivity by aligning the carbon sheets in their main yarn direction . The thermal conductivity of the composite with a carbon weight ratio of 16.5wt is increased to 0.99WK
