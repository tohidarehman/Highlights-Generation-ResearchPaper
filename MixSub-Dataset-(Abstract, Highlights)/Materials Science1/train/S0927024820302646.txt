 Recently the asymmetric transmission has been employed to enhance the cooling power of daytime radiative cooler . we argue here that the radiative cooling power can not be improved by integrating the radiative cooler with an asymmetric electromagnetic transmission device . The reason is that the equivalence between the absorption and emission of the whole structure can not be broken by adding the asymmetric transmission device . The theoretical analyses are provided to tackle this problem . The scattering matrix method is used to prove that the asymmetric transmission can be realized in reciprocal materials only when there is mode to mode conversion . However the ray tracing method did not take the mode to mode conversion into account in Wong s paper thus the absorption and emission of the whole structure could not be accurately calculated . We believe this work can prevent researchers from advancing in the improper way .

@highlight We argue here that the cooling power cannot be improved by integrating the radiative cooler with an AT device.
@highlight It is proved that AT can be realized in reciprocal materials only when there is mode to mode conversion.
@highlight The ray tracing method is not appliable to AT device because it does not take mode to mode conversion into account.
