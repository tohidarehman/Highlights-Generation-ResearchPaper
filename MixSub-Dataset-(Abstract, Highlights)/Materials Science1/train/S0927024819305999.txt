 Sub ambient cooling can be achieved through radiative coolers that selectively emit radiation within the atmospheric window to outer space and suppress absorption emission of other wavelengths . This study explores the feasibility of adopting radiative cooling in the hot and humid climate of Singapore through both numerical and experimental approaches . A theoretical simulation based on the heat transfer balance is first proposed to obtain the cooling power of the radiative cooler considering different solar spectral irradiance and total water vapor column . The larger solar irradiance in Singapore especially within the ultraviolet and visible light spectrum where the absorbance of the material is relatively high could counteract its cooling effects . Moreover the increased atmospheric radiation induced by higher humidity and temperatures in Singapore could worsen cooling performances of the radiative material . Next experimental investigations were conducted by measuring the steady state temperatures of two radiative coolers under three typical weather conditions in Singapore namely clear partly cloudy and cloudy skies . While both radiative coolers were unable to achieve daytime cooling performance on a clear day the enhanced specular reflector film with higher solar reflectance can reach sub ambient temperatures on a cloudy day . When it comes to night time the steady state temperature of the photonic radiative cooler and ESR film was about 3.5C and 5C lower than ambient respectively .
