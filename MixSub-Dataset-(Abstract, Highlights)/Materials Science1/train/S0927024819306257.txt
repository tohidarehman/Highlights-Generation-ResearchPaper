 Saharan silver ants can maintain their body temperature below ambient air due to unique triangular shaped hairs that enhance solar reflection and thermal emission through a transparent window that lies in the atmosphere . Applying this thermoregulatory prismatic structure to polydimethylsiloxane highly emsissive in the 813m spectrum we present a geometrically modified polymer based daytime passive radiative cooler . The selective thermal emitter was fabricated based on the optimized prismatic structure from Finite Difference Time Domain simulations . The average emissivity within the 813m spectrum was enhanced to 0.98 by the gradient refractive index effect while the average solar reflectivity in the visible and near infrared spectrum was measured to be 0.95 . The net radiative cooling power is estimated to reach 144W m
