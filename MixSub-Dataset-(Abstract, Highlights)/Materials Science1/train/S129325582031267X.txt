 The preparation of an atomically thin sheet of graphene h BN hybrid with lack of defects is almost unachievable as in three dimensional crystals . Here we first discussed the stability and electronic properties of GBN hybrid nanosheet which is formed by implanting a diamond shaped graphene island into the hexagonal boron nitride layout . We further investigated the effects of mono vacancy on the electronic and magnetic properties of defective GBN nanosheet . The band gap of pristine hybrid decreases with growing G island as expected and the island induces flat energy bands near the Fermi energy of the h BN nanosheet . We searched for the energetics of 7 distinct C B and N mono vacancies created at various places such as h BN region G region and interface of the optimized pristine hybrid . The G BN interface is found as the energetically most favourable place for vacancy formation . Depending on the size of the graphene island the C vacancy is the most favourable defect type in our DFT calculations . The N vacancy is energetically preferred over the B vacancy due to its lower formation energy with the exception of biggest G island . Although pristine hybrids are non magnetic semiconductors the GBN hybrid can become magnetic with a reasonable amount of magnetic moment depending on the type of vacancy and vacancy site . The vacancy defected hybrids also show the properties of semiconductor except for the hybrid involving the smallest size island with the B vacancy in the h BN layout VB
