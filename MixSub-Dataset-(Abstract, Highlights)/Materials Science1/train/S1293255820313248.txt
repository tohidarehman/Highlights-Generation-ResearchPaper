 This article carries the findings of the effect of shock waves on glycine phosphite powder samples which have been investigated under pre and post shock loaded conditions with the shock pulses of 50 and 100at the Mach number of 2.2 . Molecular structural stability and crystal structural stabilities have been established by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and powder X ray diffractometry . From XRD studies it has been observed that there is change in crystalline peak intensity peak distortion and formation of new peaks in shock wave loaded samples whereas no alteration in the original crystal system . There is no change observed in FTIR profiles at shock loaded conditions . The obtained crystallographic studies prove with substantial evidence that the crystal has molecular stability and stable crystallographic structure against the impact of applied shock waves . On the other hand many of the crystalline planes have disappeared and re appeared with respect to number of shock waves but maintaining the same crystallographic phase . From the shock wave impact study the authors suggest that GPI crystal particularly orientation is suitable for devices used in harsh environment and high power laser application due to the relative stability of the crystalline properties .

@highlight Molecular and crystallographic phase stabilities on GPI powder samples at shocked conditions are reported.
@highlight FTIR results reveal that GPI sample has spectacular molecular stability at shocked conditions.
@highlight XRD results show that stable crystal structure stability at shocked conditions.
@highlight Particularly 21 1 orientation is highly suitable for device applications due to high shock resistance.
