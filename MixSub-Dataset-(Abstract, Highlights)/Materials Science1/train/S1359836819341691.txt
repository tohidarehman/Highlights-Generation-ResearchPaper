 Thermal barrier coatings endow metal components with exceptional endure capability to withstand high temperatures over their bearable limits . Thus TBCs are indispensable in a wide range of applications related to high temperatures . However the thermal barrier performance degrades by at least 50 during service which remains a critical challenge for these coatings . Herein degradation resistant TBCs were achieved using composited structures . Thermal insulation 2D pores were spontaneously formed during thermal exposure . Moreover the degree of resistance was optimized from 20 to 50 by tailoring the orientation of the 2D pores . Thus the thermal barrier performance was self improved . A detailed examination suggests that scale progressive healing of the initial pores is primarily responsible for the degradation mechanism . Analysis of the orientation of the spontaneously formed 2D pores on thermal resistance reveals that this accounts for the self improved thermal barrier performance . These results will guide the advanced design of TBCs for future applications .
