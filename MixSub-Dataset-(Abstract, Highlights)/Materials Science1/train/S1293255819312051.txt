 Lanthanum doped copper cadmium ferrite nanocrystallite pallet sensors are synthesized using a sol gel auto combustion method and envisaged in ammonia gas sensing applications . The structure and morphology measurements of the La CCF sensors are investigated by X ray diffraction pattern and scanning electron microscopy images . The single tetragonal spinel phase is confirmed from X ray diffraction analysis . A secondary phase of LaO
