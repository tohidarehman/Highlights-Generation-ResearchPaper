 Upconversion of sub band gap photons constitutes a promising way for improving the efficiency of silicon based solar cells beyond the Shockley Queisser limit . 1500

@highlight We study upconversion in erbium ions for improved silicon based photovoltaics.
@highlight We employ carefully designed gold nanostructures to enhance the upconversion process.
@highlight We report on an unprecedented maximum 913 fold upconversion enhancement.
@highlight We discuss the improvements required for upconversion enhanced photovoltaics.
