 The aim of this paper is to evaluate the influence of sustainable surface treatments performed on flax nonwoven fabrics as textile reinforcement on the durability of calcium aluminate cement based composites . Two treatments are considered an alkaline treatment and a treatment with soybean oil . The cement hydration was studied by analysis of back scattered scanning electron microscopy images which revealed variations nearby the fibers owing their capacity for water absorption and presence of oil on the surface . A retarding effect on cement hydration was observed on the composites prepared with the oil treated fabrics . The composites containing the alkali treated fabrics had better mechanical properties and also the highest durability . For these composites it was found an optimized fiber matrix adhesion and penetrability of the cement to the fabric .

@highlight CAC based SHCC durable composites with natural nonwoven fiber reinforcement were successfully developed.
@highlight Treatments applied to the fibers helped to improve the durability of the composite s flexural behavior.
@highlight Soybean oil treatment led to a better material s performance after the accelerated aging.
@highlight Composites presented an average maximum bending strength of 15MPa and 20mm deflection.
