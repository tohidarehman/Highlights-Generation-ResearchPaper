 Aluminum substituted magnesium ferrite MgAlxFe2 xO4 are prepared by two commonly used methods Sol gel and Solid phase reaction . Structural studies are carried out using X ray and neutron diffraction and FTIR techniques and heat generation ability in the AC magnetic field is explored by the specially designed device . Diffraction patterns revealed the formation of single cubic spinel MgAl
