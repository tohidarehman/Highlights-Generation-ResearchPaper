 Efficient methods for the synthesis of carbon nanostructures with high specific surface area and controlled morphologies are crucial for their use in various applications . Here we report a low temperature precursor method for the synthesis of nanostructured carbon materials and show how the aggregate morphology and the specific surface area of isolated carbon materials depend on the composition synthesis conditions and chemical nature of the precursor . Complex zinc compounds capable of a pseudomorphic transformation into composites of the general composition ZnO nC during heating in an inert gaseous medium were used as precursors . The ZnO nanoparticles were washed from the composites by diluted formic acid . The obtained carbon materials exhibit different morphologies and specific surface areas up to 1706m

@highlight Carbon nanostructures with controlled morphologies were prepared by the precursor method.
@highlight The sample obtained from zinc glycerolate has the highest specific surface area.
@highlight Materials can be used to remove nickel ions from contaminated aqueous solutions.
