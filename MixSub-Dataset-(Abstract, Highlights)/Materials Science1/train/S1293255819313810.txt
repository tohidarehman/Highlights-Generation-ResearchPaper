 Novel tetrasubstituted cobalt phthalocyanine multi walled carbon nanotube composites CoPc MWCNTs were prepared to efficient catalytic oxidation of styrene to benzaldehyde . The CoPc MWCNTs composites were characterized by UVvis spectroscopy X ray diffraction Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy . In order to achieve efficient and selective catalysis the effects of solvent types oxidant types catalyst amount temperature and reaction time on catalytic performance have been studied . It was found that the CoPc MWCNTs composites performed very high catalytic activity in the styrene oxidation reaction . The highest styrene conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity were obtained under the optimum conditions of 20mg of CoPc MWCNTs oxidant being TBHP for 2mL and in THF at 80C for 4h . Furthermore the possible reaction mechanism for CoPc MWCNTs composites selectively oxidized styrene to benzaldehyde was also proposed .
