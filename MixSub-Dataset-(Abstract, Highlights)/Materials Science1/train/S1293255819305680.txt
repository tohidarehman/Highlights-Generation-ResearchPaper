 The morphology of the deformation relief bicrystals of AISI 316 steel was described in terms of statistical parameters and using nonparametric roughness criteria . The presence of two large scale levels of plastic deformation self organization and scaling was established . Coordinated shear in bundles of parallel shear planes was the key mechanism at the mesolevel . The processes of self organization in the dislocation substructure was the key mechanism at the microlevel . The deformation relief close to the grain boundary was investigated . Several shear systems in two grains was active at the grain boundaries . Due to this fact it was waited inconsistency of deformation and more rough relief at the grain boundaries then into grains . However there was not the high values of root mean square surface roughness at the grain boundaries . In addition the scratch testing experiment showed that the grain boundary did not have a dramatic effect in this case . The connection between the statistical parameters of the surface morphology and the stages of the stress strain curve was established .
