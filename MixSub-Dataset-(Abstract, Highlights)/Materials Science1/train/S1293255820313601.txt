 We propose a reaction scheme to selectively separate lithium ions from an aqueous urea solution by formation of lithium aluminum layered double hydroxide on aluminum metal foils . The repeated cycles of adsorption and desorption of lithium ions are possible using the topotactic reaction of lithium salts with Al

@highlight Lithium immobilization on Al metal was performed in aqueous solution in the form of LiAl
@highlight  LDH.
@highlight Growth of LiAl
@highlight  LDH strongly depends on lithium as well as urea concentrations.
@highlight Lithium recovery capability was 8g cm
