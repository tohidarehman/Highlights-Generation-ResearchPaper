 The solution processable three dimensional honeycomb like poly nanostructure networks were fabricated by hard template method for the first time . The morphology structure and electrochromic performance of the H PEDOT nanostructures were characterized . Compared with pure PEDOT film the H PEDOT nanostructured film shows improved electrochromic properties including larger optical contrast shorter response time higher coloration efficiency . The improvement of electrochromic performance is due to the highly porous honeycomb like morphology which could shorten ion diffusion length and provide more active sites for charge transfer reactions . In addition the H PEDOT nanostructured film was assembled into patterned all solid state electrochromic devices . These patterned electrochromic devices show obvious color variation and fast switching speed . The patterned electrochromic displays exhibit promising applications in energy efficient displays e books and e cards .
