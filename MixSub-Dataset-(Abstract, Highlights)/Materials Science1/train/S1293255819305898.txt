 Manganese doped Nickel ferrites nanoparticles have been synthesized by modified co precipitation method for investigating the effects of adding dopant ions after formation of nucleation centers in the reaction medium . The structure and magnetic properties of the as synthesized samples have been studied by X ray diffraction Field emission scanning electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Vibrating sample magnetometer . The structural results showed that all the samples have cubic spinel phase with the average 21nm crystallite size . In addition variation of the preferred XRD peak from orientation to occurred because of the compressive strain in the structure which was calculated by means of Williamson Hall method . Adding dopant ions after nucleation caused strain spin canting and reduction of saturation magnetization .

@highlight Manganese doped nickel ferrite NPs have been prepared by means of modified co precipitation method.
@highlight Adding Mn ions after nucleation center formation led to change in preferred orientation peak of the XRD patterns.
@highlight FT IR analysis confirmed the different ion distribution in the spinel structure.
@highlight Saturation magnetization decrement because of Mn ions increment is a result of strain spin canting and different ion distribution.
