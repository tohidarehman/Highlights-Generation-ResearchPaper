 Over the past decades the accumulation of organic pollutants in surface water groundwater and even drinking water have raised as a serious issue . A photocatalytic process using a semiconductor like TiO

@highlight SiO2 core particles were synthesized by a Stber method.
@highlight TiO2 shells with different thicknesses were coated around SiO2 cores.
@highlight SiO2 cores were removed by NaOH treatment.
@highlight Microstructure analysis confirmed that shell thickness was controlled successfully.
@highlight Particle size shell thickness and structure affect photocatalytic activity.
