 Pb free perovskite solar cells are investigated to eliminate the toxic Pb . However the Pb free perovskite solar cell with power conversion efficiency of below 9 has been reported mainly because of low open circuit voltage V

@highlight Theoretical analysis of SnGe perovskite solar cell was conducted to improve V
@highlight is strongly influenced by built in voltage across perovskite absorber V

@highlight depends on E
