 Solar selective absorbers are excellent candidates to improve the solar thermal conversion efficiency . However the absorbers with thermal stability at high working temperatures are still lacking . Here we reported a solar selective absorber based on nano multilayered AlCrSiO films synthesized by a cathodic arc ion plating system . The absorber consisted of a TiN IR reflective layer two nano multilayered AlCrSiO films and a top amorphous oxide AlCrSiO layer had high absorptance of 0.9230.927 and low emittance of 0.1600.193 . To study the high temperature thermal stability the absorber was annealed at 600700C in air for 200h . The variations in the optical performances and microstructures of the annealed absorber were characterized by UVVis near IR spectrophotometer FTIR TEM SEM EDS XRD and Raman . The results indicated that the absorber had a thermal stability with a selectivity of 0.923 0.161 up to 650C in air for 200h . The nano multilayered structure of AlCrSiO films was highly stable when annealed at 650C . The amorphous AlCrSiO layer could form a dense oxide layer capping on the absorber surface effectively limiting the oxygen diffusion into the inter absorber . Therefore the AlCrSiO based solar selective absorber with excellent thermal stability could be possibly applied to high temperature solar thermal conversion .
