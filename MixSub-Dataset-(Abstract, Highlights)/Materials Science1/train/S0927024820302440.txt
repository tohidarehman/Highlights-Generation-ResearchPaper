 Due to Silicon material abundance and lower cost integration of high efficiency III V solar cells on Si substrates is of major importance for future solar energy harvesting devices . In this paper we report on the growth optimization with a detailed characterization of epitaxial growth of crystalline GaAs on porous silicon layers and demonstration of single junction GaAs solar cell on PSL performances . GaAs deposition is performed on engineered porous Si surfaces with different growth temperatures . One and two steps growth were also investigated . X ray diffraction demonstrated almost one order of magnitude lower threading dislocation density of 2 10

@highlight First GaAs solar cell demonstration on Porous Silicon Layer.
@highlight Evaluation of nanoheteroepitaxtial NHE growth on engineered porous Si surface.
@highlight Two step growth for good crystalline quality GaAs layers..
@highlight Defect density in the layers attributed principally to threading dislocations TDs and antiphase domains boundaries.
@highlight Porous Silicon Layers help reduces GaAs layers strain.
