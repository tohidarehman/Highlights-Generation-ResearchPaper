 In this paper composite phase change materials were prepared by the impregnation method with poly g octadecanol comb like polymer as PCMs and reduced graphene oxide carbon nanotubes hybrid aerogel that x varies from 0.5 to 2 as supporting matrix . Thermal properties such as phase change enthalpy thermal repeatability and shape stabilization of cPCMs were investigated by FTIR DSC and thermocouple .

@highlight 300 increased thermal conductivity of comb like PCMs by CNTs rGO aerogels.
@highlight An optimal 16min light charging time satisfies the thermal release process.
@highlight Fabric treated by
@highlight cPCMs presents the good thermal management performance.
