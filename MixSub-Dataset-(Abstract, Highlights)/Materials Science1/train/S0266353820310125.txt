 We herein report a unique scientific strategy in engineering green composites with excellent balanced performance of stiffness toughness and heat deflection temperature . To achieve such target a high melt strength bioplastic blend of poly PBS and poly PBAT with super toughness could take up stiff natural fibres like inexpensive purpose grown Miscanthus fibre and Oat hull in the green composite structure through reactive extrusion . The novelty of this work is to allow the free radical reaction to occur within polymer matrix and between the blend and natural fibres by introducing biomass from a side feeder aiming to achieve matrix toughening and polymer fibre interface enhancement simultaneously . Tensile modulus of the bio blends was improved by maximum 650 with the reinforcement of 40wt agricultural by products . For equal amounts of 40 biomass fibres the Miscanthus fibre is more suitable to strengthen the biopolymers in terms of higher modulus higher HDT and lower water absorption however the oat hull composites show much higher impact strength of 83J m. A systematical structure properties relationship study indicates that higher aspect ratio higher cellulose contents and stronger interfacial actions account for the higher stiffness and HDT of the Miscanthus fibre composites compared to the oat hull filled counterparts . This abundant biomass has potential to fabricate sustainable composites to substitute certain fossil fuel based plastics in terms of mechanical and thermal properties as well as cost and energy saving via using the industrial friendly technology as proposed here .
