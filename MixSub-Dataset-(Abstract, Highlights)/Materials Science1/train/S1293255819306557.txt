 Doped semiconductors nanostructures have shown great interest as a potential for green and efficient photocatalysis activities . Magnesium doped zinc oxide nanoparticles has been synthesized by a one step chemical low temperature co precipitation method without further calcination and their photocatalytic performance for photodegradation of Methylene blue dye under the illumination of solar light is investigated . The crystal structure of the synthesized NPs is examined by X ray diffraction . XRD data indicates a slight shift towards higher 2 angle in Mg doped samples as compared to the pure ZnO NPs which suggest the incorporation of Mg

@highlight Base and Magnesium doped ZnO NPs were synthesized by the chemical low temperature co precipitation route.
@highlight The photodegradation efficiency was found to be increasing with increasing the atomic concentration of Magnesium.
@highlight Trapping experiments indicated that holes are the major species that were responsible for the degradation of Methylene blue.
@highlight Methylene blue was found to degrade faster than the Congo red.
