 A rapid thermal anneal is used to crystallize the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition deposited hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin film to form the phosphorus doped polysilicon passivated contact in tunnel oxide passivated contact solar cells . The effects of annealing temperature annealing time cooling time and the polysilicon thickness on the surface passivation are investigated . The primary advantage of the RTA is reducing the whole crystallization period to 15min shorter than the conventional tube furnace annealing period of 60min . We find that the RTA is a robust method to prepare high quality polysilicon passivated contact without introducing blistering when the thickness of the a Si H is less than 40nm . The optimized RTA process leads to an implied open circuit voltage i
