 Carbon based polymer composite materials due to the high specific strength and good chemical stability features is a promising structural material for energy efficient applications in aerospace and civil infrastructures . However the difficulty of viscosity related infusing and curing of polymer limits composite mechanical performance and manufacturing efficiency . Here we overcome these difficulties and report an electrothermal triggered flooded thermoset curing to enable rapid and energy efficient manufacturing of carbon polymer composite . The underlying concept is based on the two step localized

@highlight An energy efficient and scalable electrothermal triggered thermoset curing approach.
@highlight The curing approach exhibits the ability to control the viscosity of the polymer.
@highlight Electrothermal preforms can facilitate the flow of polymer into the microstructure.
@highlight The preparation process of carbon fibers and CNTs composites was demonstrated.
