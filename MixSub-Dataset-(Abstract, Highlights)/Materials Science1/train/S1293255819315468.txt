 The formation of boron carbide under high pressures and from elemental reactants has been studied . To this end stoichiometric mixtures of commercial crystalline beta rhombohedral boron and amorphous glassy carbon have been subjected to temperatures ranging from 1473K to 2473Kat pressures of 2GPa and 5GPa . Similar syntheses have been repeated for crystalline boron and graphite . As the synthesis pressure increases the temperature of formation of boron carbide is found to increase as well . Moreover the reaction temperature is shown to be affected by the choice of the reactants .
