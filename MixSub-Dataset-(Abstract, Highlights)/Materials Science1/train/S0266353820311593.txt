 Herein self healing multi branched cellulose nanocrystals polyvinyl alcohol composite films with excellent sensitivity to human motions was synthesized by employing MCNC as reinforcing agent where the potassium chloride was added to enhance the conductivity and strain sensitivity of the composite film . There was a synergistic effect between MCNC and PVA which could promote the slip and recombination of hydrogen bonds so that the films had robust strength and high self healing efficiency . Especially the flexible composite film could clearly monitor both large and subtle human motions and showed larger subtle strain sensitivity with a gauge factor of 2.4 which was relatively larger than the GF of ionic hydrogel and film based skin sensors which could solve the current problems of poor mechanical flexibility and low sensitivity of electronic skin and had great potential application in the fields of self healing soft electronic skin sensors for human motion detection and healthcare .

@highlight Both strength and toughness of PVA are improved significantly by adding MCNC.
@highlight Composites had robust strength 2.2 times to pure PVA and high self healing efficiency.
@highlight Possible self healing and strain sensing mechanisms of composite are provided.
@highlight Self healing composite films can detect monitor large subtle human and insect motions.
@highlight Ultrasensitive composites with larger GF of 2.4 than ionic hydrogel and film based sensors.
