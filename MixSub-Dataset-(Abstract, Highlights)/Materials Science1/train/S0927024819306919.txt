 This paper investigates the heat transfer characteristics of a prototype latent heat energy storage system with novel metal insert design configuration . The novel thermal energy storage system consist ofa vertical cylindrical shell a helical coil and metalinserts withliquid metal gallium designed for LHES capacity of 13MJ . 25kg of D Mannitol is investigated as a phase change material forenergy storage and property tests were conducted on DM . PCM was cycled 1000 times and checked for suitability for long term energy storage applications . Results confirmed that the addition of MI with Ga enhanced the thermal performance of the TES system . Moreover the vertical orientation of the shell as well as the metal inserts supported natural convection during charging cycles and acted as a nucleation sites during discharging cycles thereby assuring rapid charging and discharging of the TES system . High thermal conductivity low specific heat of Ga and its liquid phase atroom temperatures helped Ga act as thermal energy carriers in TES unit . Maximum power output of 0.64kW was obtained during solidification cycle and efficiency range of 8789 for MI configuration . The presented novel LHES design can be used with a wide range of PCM and over a different temperature range of applications mainly for water heating high temperature industrial waste heat recovery and solar thermal applications .
