 Currently concentration induced near infrared upconversion quenching at highly doped levels of lanthanide ions poses a significant constraint for their practical applications . In this work the fabricated Tm

@highlight We fabricated a new photoresponsive material of Tm Yb co doped Na
@highlight Bi
@highlight Nb
@highlight  NBN .
@highlight They exhibited a strong single band NIR upconversion emission with no obvious concentration quenching.
@highlight NIR emission intensity can be effectively tuned by sunlight irradiation.
