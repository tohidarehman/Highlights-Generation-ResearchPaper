 Copper plating can provide significant cost savings over screen printed Ag for industrially produced Si photovoltaic modules however concerns exist with regard to the durability of Cu plated modules . This study investigated the effect of different capping layers and their method of application on the durability of Cu plated PERC one cell modules with a focus on durability after damp heat testing . It is shown that the adhesion of Cu plated fingers capped with immersion plated Ag and Sn was poorer than that of fingers capped with light induced plated Ag due to the under etching of Cu finger by corrosive additives that are present in the immersion plating formulations . It is proposed that the weak finger adhesion resulted in fingers dislodging during DH testing of the modules thereby opening a pathway for Cu to in diffuse into Si resulting initially in an increased non ideal recombination and then increased series resistance due to encapsulant flowing under the dislodged finger . Increased recombination due to the Cu in diffusion was evident in cells with poor finger adhesion through an increase of the non ideal recombination current density

@highlight Non ideal recombination is observed in Cu plated module after damp heat test.
@highlight Degradation of Cu plated module is correlated to weak finger contact adhesion.
@highlight Cross sectional imaging shows finger dislodgement due to weak finger adhesion.
@highlight Finger dislodgement enabled Cu diffusion into Si increasing non ideal recombination.
@highlight Immersion capping layers showed lower finger adhesion due to under etching of Cu.
