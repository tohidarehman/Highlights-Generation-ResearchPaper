 A Z scheme based BiOI CdS heterojunction was synthesized by in situ stirring and calcining method . Various characterization techniques including X ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy Raman spectroscopy diffuse reflection spectroscopy photoluminescence and photocurrent test were used to study the crystallographi structure morphology and optical and electrical properties of the as prepared samples . By constructing a Z scheme heterojunction the transfer of photogenerated carriers between BiOI and CdS is realized thereby effectively improving the photocatalytic activity . Free radical capture experiments show that O

@highlight A Z scheme based BiOI CdS heterojunction was successfully fabricated.
@highlight The BiOI CdS heterojunction was active for dye degradation under visible light.
@highlight Z scheme charge carrier transfer was proved by radical scavenging experiment and XPS.
