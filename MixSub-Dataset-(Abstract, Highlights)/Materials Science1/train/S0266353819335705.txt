 Composite dielectrics with high vacuum insulation properties are integral to today s advanced energy transmission . In this study 5 mol Yttrium doped BiFeO

@highlight The surface breakdown strength of the epoxy composite with Yttrium doped BiFeO
@highlight particles increases by up to 111 with optimal filler concentration.
@highlight The polarization response of the nanocomposite to an external field was simulated to explain the reasons for the dielectric variations.
@highlight These results provide evidence for ETPR theory which has been disputed for nearly 30 years.
