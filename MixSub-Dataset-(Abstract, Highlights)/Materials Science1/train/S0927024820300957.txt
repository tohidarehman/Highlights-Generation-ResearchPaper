 In recent times solar steam generation has proven to be an efficient method for seawater desalination . Herein we report a novel solar evaporator designed with plant derived carbon nanospheres obtained from

@highlight A novel evaporation device using low cost and abundant materials such as camphor soot and polyvinyl alcohol sponge.
@highlight An excellent solar thermal efficiency of 92.38 was achieved at 1 sun illumination.
@highlight An array of evaporation devices incorporated into a facile passive solar still demonstrated successful sea water desalination.
@highlight The performance of the solar still was high even at low solar intensities and clean water was successfully obtained.
@highlight The solar still could operate in humid and cloudy days as well displaying its application in real world applications.
