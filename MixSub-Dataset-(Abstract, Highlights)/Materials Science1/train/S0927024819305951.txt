 Nanofluids are considered as promising alternative in heat exchange processes to the classical fluids which usually present poor thermal properties . One interesting application for nanofluids is as heat transfer fluid in solar thermal applications plants . Boron nitride nanotubes present interesting thermophysical properties for use in nanofluids . Therefore nanofluids based on boron nitride nanotubes were prepared by a two step method dispersing this nanomaterial in a heat transfer fluid typically used . Stability rheological and thermal properties of the nanofluids were analysed . To check the stability ultravioletvisible spectroscopy and particle size and potential measurements were performed for a month obtaining that the nanofluids were stable . Furthermore surface tension was measured and no significant differences were observed with regard to the base fluid . In a variable range of temperature nanofluids show Newtonian behaviour with a slight increase in viscosity . Besides the boron nitride nanotubes caused an increase in thermal conductivity of up to 33 with regard to the base fluid . The use of these nanofluids also led to an improvement in the heat transfer coefficient under turbulent flow conditions of up to 18 . Finally the analysis of the outlet temperature in solar thermal applications shows that these nanofluids are a promising alternative in this application .
