 Structural composites with high fracture toughness have wide applications in various fields . However achieving high toughening efficiency at low fabricating cost is still challenging . Here one dimensional carbon nanofibers were incorporated into the ethylene octene copolymer toughened polypropylene blends . The fracture behaviors of the samples were systematically researched under different load conditions such as impact load condition three point bending test and single edge notched tensile measurement and then the toughening mechanisms were proposed . The results indicated that CNFs dramatically enhanced the fracture toughness of the PP POE blends due to that CNFs prevented the initiation and propagation of crazes . Furthermore through incorporating an additional annealing treatment the fracture mechanism of composites changed from crazing fracture to shear yielding crazing fracture which endowed CNFs with more apparent toughening effect . For example at POE and CNF contents of 25wt and 1wt the annealed composite sample showed the impact strength of 69.4kJ m
