 The shape and intrinsic pore structure of pristine and partially reduced graphene oxide aerogels hydrogels was imaged using three complementary techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging Computer Tomography and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Imaging . Each method is sensitive to different features of the sample CT images are contrasted with mass density changes across sample MRI with hydrogen density nuclear relaxation times diffusion and finally EPRI with radical density . The complementarity of the techniques is presented on exemplary chosen prGO aerogels which are currently researched for variety of applications such as biomaterials in tissue engineering . All techniques have their strengths and weaknesses which are thoroughly pointed out and discussed . EPRI technique which has been perfected only during last years is used here for the first time to image carbon based foams . Finally scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy is used to characterize surface and elemental content of fabricated prGO aerogels hydrogels .
