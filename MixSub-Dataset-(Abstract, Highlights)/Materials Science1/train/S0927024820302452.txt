 Electrochromic devices displaying multicolor patterns have attracted great interests in a wide range of applications . Considering the complexity in the integration of various EC materials and multi electrode configurations the design of multicolor patterned ECDs based on simple approaches remains an elusive goal . Here we present a self patterning ECD based on a single layer of multicolor polyaniline film . The device demonstrates a novel and simplified three layer structure including PANI layer gel electrolyte and conducting layer which is distinguished from conventional EC devices with typical five layers . Furthermore a working principle responsible for the self patterning is proposed based on the horizontal movement and redistribution of anions in PANI layer driven by a current . This unique ionic transport mode contributes to the formation of a multicolor pattern composed of three segments . The dynamic variation of the pattern could be achieved by changing the direction and strength of the current from which the device exhibits a high transmittance contrast of 60 at 630nm fast response rate and good cycling performance . It is envisioned that this work may provide a new insight to develop self patterning ECDs for wide applications in information displays smart fabric and military camouflage .
