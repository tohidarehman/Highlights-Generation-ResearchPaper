 Aiming at higher cell efficiency and lower Ag consumption research focuses on achieving smaller finger lines for silicon solar cell front side metallization . In depth understanding of the printing process is mandatory to achieve uniform defect free lines with high aspect ratio . An innovative high speed video imaging setup allows for tracking of the mechanisms happening within 1050ms during the screen printing process . Two pastes differing significantly with respect to their rheological as well as wetting properties are used in this study . A paste spreading mechanism consisting of different consecutive process steps determines the final line shape . During nip contact the paste is squeezed between screen emulsion and substrate . Paste spreading further proceeds as long as the screen clings to the substrate it occurs in a regular pattern and is most pronounced in the regions were mesh wires approach the emulsion surface . Then sudden retraction takes place during snap off and the final line width is essentially fixed . Spreading is more pronounced for the paste exhibiting low viscosity at high shear rates and strong wetting of screen emulsion and substrate . The overall paste transfer is promoted by poor screen wetting and strong paste cohesion . These insights will stimulate further improvement of Ag paste formulation for solar cell metallization .
