 Aim of the present paper is to evaluate how the bearing behavior of pinned flax composites can be influenced by their exposition to critical environment such as marine one . To this scope flax fibers epoxy pinned laminate was exposed up to 60 days to salt fog environment according to ASTM B 117 standard .

@highlight Bearing behavior of pin loaded flax laminates was investigated in severe environmental conditions.
@highlight Bearing stress evolution and failure mechanisms were evaluated at varying pin diameter and hole to sample edge distance.
@highlight Salt fog aging induced modification on the mechanical performances of the pinned composite joint.
@highlight Failure map was developed showing a progressive modification of damage mechanisms transitions at increasing aging time.
@highlight Threshold values of E D and W D at varying salt fog exposition time were defined.
