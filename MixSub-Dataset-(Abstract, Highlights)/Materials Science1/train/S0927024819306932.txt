 Bifacial perovskite crystalline silicon tandem photovoltaic modules that harvest albedo radiation are a promising strategy to further enhance the energy yield of monofacial perovskite c Si tandem PV modules . Given the required current matching in bifacial perovskite c Si two terminal tandem PV modules predicting the expected enhancement in EY requires an advanced EY modelling framework . In this study the architecture module tilt perovskite absorber layer thickness and bandgap of the perovskite top solar cell are optimized for several types of grounds and two locations . Compared to bifacial c Si single junction PV modules the relative enhancement in EY of textured bifacial perovskite c Si 2T tandem PV modules is around 2438 for an exemplary grass ground . With increasing albedo the optimum bandgap of the perovskite top solar cell decreases from 1.72eV to 1.55eV . This is attributed to enhanced current generation only in the c Si bottom solar cell due to albedo radiation entering the solar cell at the rear side . In addition minor optical losses due to ground shading are found for modules with a finite mounting height in the range of 1m . Overall our study highlights the importance of EY modelling to assess the performance of bifacial perovskite c Si tandem PV . It provides direction for the design of bifacial perovskite c Si tandem solar cells with regard to the device architecture and the choice of the perovskite material with regard to its bandgap .
