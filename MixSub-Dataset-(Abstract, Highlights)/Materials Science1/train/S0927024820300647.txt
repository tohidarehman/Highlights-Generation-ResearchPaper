 Rear side application of polycrystalline silicon passivated contacts has demonstrated very high efficiencies for single junction monocrystalline silicon solar cells . To further improve the device performance one possible approach is to apply the passivated contact concept to the front side of the solar cell as well . The front side application requires the use of ultra thin poly Si layer in order to suppress parasitic absorption . Suitable ex situ diffusion process should be developed accordingly without damaging the passivation provided by the very thin interface oxide iO
