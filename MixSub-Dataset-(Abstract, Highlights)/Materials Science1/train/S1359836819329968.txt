 Graphene oxide modified cementitious materials have the potential to be increasingly applied in a range of important areas due to the enhanced microstructure mechanical properties and durability . This work presents a thermodynamic focused analysis of tricalcium silicate Fe FC

@highlight GO can increase the Si concentration while reducing the Ca concentration during the first 2h of hydration.
@highlight GO can improve the undersaturation of C
@highlight S and supersaturation of portlandite while reducing the supersaturation of CSH.
@highlight GO can facilitate both dissolution rate of C
@highlight S and precipitation rate of CSH.
@highlight GO can promote the overall hydration degree and hydration rate of C
@highlight S.
