 Thermal energy storage at temperatures above 400C is critical for efficient industrial processes and continuous solar thermal power generation . Phase change materials can be used for both latent heat storage and improved conversion efficiencies but their use has been prevented by the large 525 change in molar volume . Herein shape stabilized PCMs are prepared using 20 wt . mesoporous silica matrices and NaClNaBrNa
