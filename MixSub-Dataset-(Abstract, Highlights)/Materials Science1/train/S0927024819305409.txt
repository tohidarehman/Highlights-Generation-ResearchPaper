 Multi component photocatalysts have been considered as promising candidates to overcome fast charge recombination phenomena in solar water splitting process which improve electron utilizations in reductive hydrogen generation . However most reported multi component systems have been rarely fabricated by aids with z scheme type components . Thus cuprous and cupric oxides are proposed as an excellent example for a z scheme system with ZnO base materials . The ZnO particles are firstly synthesized by a precipitation method and CuS components are added on the ZnO particle surfaces in various compositions . The ZnO CuS materials are then thermally treated under controlled oxygen atmosphere to form cuprous and cupric oxides . To enhance photoactive electrons for reductive water splitting in conduction bands of the photocatalyst system optimum content of cuprous oxides in the z scheme components is a critical factor . At the optimum cuprous content in the copper oxides the highest hydrogen production rate of 1092.5 molg
