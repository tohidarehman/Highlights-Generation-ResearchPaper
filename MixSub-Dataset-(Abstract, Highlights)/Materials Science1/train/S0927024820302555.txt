 We present a novel low temperature approach to multijunction solar cell fabrication combining the high efficiency multi junction concept with the low cost of thin film technology in one solar cell structure . The intermetallic bonding approach presented is based on joining indium metal which has been deposited on the metal contact grid of the respective solar cells . This approach avoids the problems of lattice mismatch and tunnel junction limitations connecting solar cells of potentially any material with patterned contacts . No measurable increase in resistance has been measured between bonded materials . This method allows the independent development of each cell technology for use in multijunction solar cells . This technique can be applied to any commercial off the shelf solar cells if available . A GaAs Si multijunction solar cell bonded using this approach is demonstrated . The silicon cell is off the shelf with textured surface and commercial metal contacts . This is integrated with an in house grown thin film GaAs cell . The GaAs Si device is demonstrated in both two and three terminal configurations .

@highlight We present a new method for bonding solar cells in a multi junction structure.
@highlight Low temperature and pressure bonding is achieved using Indium intermetallic bonding.
@highlight The bonding process displayed no increase in series resistance.
@highlight Indium hardness self diffusion and surface oxide of Indium are shown as beneficial.
