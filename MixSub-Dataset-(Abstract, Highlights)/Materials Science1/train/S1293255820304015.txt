 The untreated effluents from our textile industries are directly discharged into water streams thus causing a serious health hazard to aquatic as well as human life . Presently direct dye Indisole blue an azo dye has been degraded by novel hydrothermally fabricated LaCeZr

@highlight LaCeZr
@highlight SnSe composite was synthesized by facile and economic hydrothermal method.
@highlight The composite showed excellent photocatalytic efficiency of 97 under visible light.
@highlight The higher activity was due to reduction in e
@highlight  h
@highlight recombination rate.
@highlight The material also showed excellent stability as well as reusability.
