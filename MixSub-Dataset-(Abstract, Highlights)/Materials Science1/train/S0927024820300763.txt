 Light and elevated temperature induced degradation can have a severe impact on the carrier lifetime of silicon substrates used in solar cell production and thus remains a crucial challenge for manufacturers . In this work we introduce a two step annealing process to mitigate LeTID in multi crystalline silicon passivated emitter and rear cell solar cells . We demonstrate that the first annealing step with a slow belt speed plays a primary role in mitigating LeTID in the cells but also results in an increase in contact resistance . The application of a second annealing step at a similar temperature with a faster belt speed recovers the contact resistance whilst maintaining the stability of the cell . Applying this approach to the
