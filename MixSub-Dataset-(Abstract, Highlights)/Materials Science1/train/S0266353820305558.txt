 To date the fabrication of high performance flexible energy harvesters nanogenerators based on piezoelectric poly is of great concern due to their huge potential to realize full flexible self powered electronics . Herein in this work we report a flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator based on a textured hybrid film consisting of PVDF and manganese dioxide MnO

@highlight A novel piezoelectric PVDF based composite with highly aligned MnO2 rods was developed for energy harvesting application.
@highlight MnO2 rods can effectively promote interfacial polarization within PVDF and boosting piezoelectric and output responses.
@highlight The superior mechanical property while low dielectric constant of composites can further harness the output enhancement.
