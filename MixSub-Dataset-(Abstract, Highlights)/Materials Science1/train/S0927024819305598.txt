 The research of broadband photodetectors has been attracting extensive attention because of their great importance and application potentials in numerous fields . In this study we proposed a perovskite based photovoltaic broadband photodetector using silicon nanoporous pillar array as the hole transport layer as well as the growth template . By optimizing the conditions of solvent vapors annealing approach the conformal growth of high quality CH

@highlight Si NPA was used as the functional template to fabricate the perovskite photodetector.
@highlight Enhanced performance were obtained compared with the planar Si based device.
@highlight The device is featured by a broadband response with a self powered ability.
@highlight Self formed coaxial core shell structure favors for a good device stability.
