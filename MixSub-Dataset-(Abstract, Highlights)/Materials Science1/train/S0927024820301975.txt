 Effective electron transport layers provide enhanced charge separation and transport therefore as a vital part in improving the efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells . Herein we report a new synergistic strategy using HI to passivate TiO

@highlight HI assists in the preparation of TiO
@highlight and eliminates defects.
@highlight Tin element is incorporated into HI passivated TiO
@highlight precursor solution to construct composite TiO
@highlight  SnO
@highlight film affording increased electron mobility and suitable energy level.
@highlight All preparation processes of device are fully conducted in uncontrolled ambient conditions.
