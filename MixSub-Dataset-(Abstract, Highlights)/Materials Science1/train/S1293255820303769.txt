 Studies of the dielectric behavior of chalcogenide glasses are very important for a better understanding of the transport mechanisms . The characterization of different electric properties of the ChGs in thin film form is an essential demand of the scientific and industrial research fields . This paper reports the dielectric behavior of amorphous thin films of Ge containing SeTeSn alloy . Our analysis shows that sufficient dielectric dispersion is present in amorphous thin films of each sample . Relatively few works have been done in the direction of comparing the results of dielectric constant and loss in bulk glassy samples and amorphous thin film samples of some glassy alloys of SeTeSnGe system to decide the optimized condition for technological applications and industrial production . We have also made an attempt to compare and discuss the behavior of the compositional dependence of dielectric constant and loss of thin film samples with the results of other Ge containing glassy systems reported in published works that might shed light for using these glasses in several interesting applications .
