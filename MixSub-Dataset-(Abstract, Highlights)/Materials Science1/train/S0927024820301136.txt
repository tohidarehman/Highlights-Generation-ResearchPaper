 Salt hydrate based thermochemical heat storage is currently a pivotal technique used for long term energy storage due to its reversible gas solid reaction at middle to low temperature . MgSO

@highlight Salt mixtures composed of MgSO
@highlight and SrCl
@highlight are developed.
@highlight Composite salt of 20M wt increases the volumetric ESD to 595kWh m
@highlight under 150C.
@highlight Adsorption kinetic and capacity are enhanced.
@highlight 75 of the original ESD is maintained after 20 cycles.
