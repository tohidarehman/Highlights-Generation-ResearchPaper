 We report on the inclusion of 5 aminovaleric acid a bulky long chained organic moleculeas an additive to enhance the mechanical integrity of hybrid perovskite films . We studied a range of organic cation additives and found that 5 AVA was the most effective at improving cohesion energy a key metric of mechanical reliability . MAPbI

@highlight 5 aminovaleric acid 5 AVA improves mechanical reliability of perovskite films.
@highlight Grain size increased with 5 AVA at 5 concentration compared to other additives.
@highlight Perovskite crystal structure is not modified with 5 AVA no 2D perovskite phase.
@highlight 5 AVA passivates perovskite surface and improves voltage output.
