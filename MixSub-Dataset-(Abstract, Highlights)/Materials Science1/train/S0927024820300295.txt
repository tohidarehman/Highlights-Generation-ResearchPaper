 The tunnel oxide passivated contact solar cells on n type Cz Si wafers instead of passivated emitter and rear solar cells are currently migrated to mainstream production with ongoing improvements in recent years . In this study we investigated and characterized one recent batch of TOPCon cells fabricated on 156.75156.750.18mm

@highlight One batch of TOPCon solar cells fabricated by the industrial type process.
@highlight Comparison of different SiO
@highlight layer thickness for TOPCon solar cells.
@highlight Cells with SiO
@highlight layer thickness of 1.55nm exhibited the best passivation effect.
@highlight Eff Voc and FF as high as 22.43 689.4mV and 81.35 were obtained respectively.
@highlight Metal shading loss and rear surface recombination were dominant.
