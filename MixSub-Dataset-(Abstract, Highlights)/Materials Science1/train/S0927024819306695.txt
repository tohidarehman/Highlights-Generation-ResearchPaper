 Reversible electrodeposition devices exhibit both transparent and mirror states allowing light penetration and reflection . Therefore the incident light transmission regulates the radiant heat generation . However the low bistability of these devices is the main limitation to their application in windows since it causes continue energy consumption to maintain the mirror state this is mainly due to the presence of Cu ions in the electrolyte which is the main dissolution agent of the deposited Ag metal . Thus we used a three layered TiO
