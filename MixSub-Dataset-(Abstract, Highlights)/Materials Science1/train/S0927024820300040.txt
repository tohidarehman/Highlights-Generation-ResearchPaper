 This study examined the effects of the thermal deformation of a silicone on glass micro aspheric lens on the optical performance of a concentrator photovoltaic module . Thermal deformation of the lens induced by temperature variation causes defocalization of the spot of concentrated light on the solar cell resulting in a change in the optical efficiency and irradiance uniformity in the solar cell area . The irradiance uniformity affects the fill factor of the solar cell . The effects of the thermal deformation of the lens on the optical efficiency and irradiance uniformity in the solar cell area were evaluated through a three dimensional thermal deformation simulation and ray tracing simulation . The simulation methods were validated by indoor heating tests using a prototype SOG lens and IIIV triple junction solar cell . The simulation results for optical systems with geometric concentration ratios of 200and 500revealed that the temperature dependences of the optical performances of a system with SOG micro aspheric lenses showed similar trends to those of a system with SOG Fresnel lenses designed with the same lens surface profiles as aspheric lenses .
