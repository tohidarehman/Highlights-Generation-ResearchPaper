 Soiling of solar cover glass can cause a significant loss of electrical output from PV panels . Dew condensed on the surface exacerbates soiling rates and promotes reactions between dust and glass leading to stronger adhesive forces that make cleaning more expensive . To reduce soiling rates and lower cleaning costs anti soiling coatings are being developed . Although the interactions between dust particles and uncoated low iron glass surfaces are known the mechanisms by which anti soiling coatings reduce soiling rates are less well understood .

@highlight Hydrophobic coatings reduce soiling rates by 42 compared to hydrophilic surfaces.
@highlight Two mechanisms reduce soiling dropwise condensation and high water droplet mobility.
@highlight Soil becomes concentrated or herded as droplets evaporate on hydrophobic coatings.
@highlight Cleaning efficacy improved by reduced soil coating and water coating interactions.
