 In this study polyphosphazene microspheres was prepared by reaction under ultrasonic conditions using hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene and 4 4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone as raw materials . Phosphoric acid functionalized microporous carbon materials denoted as CS PO

@highlight The adsorbent of N P and S co doped carbon materials CS PO
@highlight  was developed from the precursor.
@highlight Maximum sorption capacity of the adsorbent is 964.55 mg g at pH 6.0 and 298 K.
@highlight The adsorbent possesses a microporous structure with high porosity and fast adsorption rate.
