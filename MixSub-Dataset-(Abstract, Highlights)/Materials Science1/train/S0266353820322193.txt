 With the rapidly growing power density of integrated circuits in modern electronic devices how to construct efficient thermal conductive network achieving advanced heat conduction materials has attracted widespread attention . In this work at an extremely low content of carbon nanotubes a synergistic hybrid structure of bridged boron nitride nanosheets by CNTs was constructed along the polyvinyl alcohol fibers by electrospinning and simply resin transfer molding method was employed to produce Epoxy PVA composite film . Fabricated Epoxy PVA composite film not only presented great in plane thermal conductivity 6.3W mK at total filler loading of 27.5wt higher than that of Epoxy PVA composite film without CNTs by 88 but also exhibited excellent electrical insulating properties 610

@highlight BNNSs bridged by oriented CNTs along PVA fibers by electrospinning.
@highlight Highly enhanced in plane TC up to 6.3W mK with low hybrid filler content.
@highlight The composite has good mechanical properties and stable TC after bending cycles.
