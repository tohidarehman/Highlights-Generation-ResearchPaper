 Polymer composites with high thermal conductivity are required for addressing the heat management issues associated with the rapid growth of electronic device technology . As a strategy to improve the heat dissipation ability of composites graphene has been attracting attention as a filler due to its superior high thermal conductivity . However its high electrical conductivity poses a challenge for use in electronic applications . In this study we report the synthesis of silicon oxycarbonitride coated reduced graphene oxide by an oil water biphasic solution process to improve the thermal conductivity of epoxy composites . The precursors are prepared by controlling the hydrolysis condensation reactions and are subsequently transformed to polymer derived ceramics by pyrolysis . The manufactured Al
