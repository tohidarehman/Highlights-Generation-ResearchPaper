 Encapsulation is an effective method to prevent leakage of molten phase change materials . However it is difficult for microcapsules to acquire high latent heat capacity as well as good thermal cycling performance . In the present study double shell microcapsules using aluminum silicon alloy as the core Al

@highlight Microcapsules with double shell consisted of inner Al
@highlight shell and outer mullite shell were prepared.
@highlight Latent heat storage and its charge rate of microcapsules were as high as 367.1Jg
@highlight and 72.0Jg

@highlight  respectively.
@highlight Thermal cycles of microcapsules could reach 3000.
@highlight Total heat absorption of microcapsules increased by 22.7 owing to the latent heat.
