 High entropy alloys films with the composition of MoNbHfZrTiN and MoNbHfZrTiON are fabricated by a reactive RF magnetron sputtering which have a good solar spectral selectivity and are used for solar thermal absorption coatings . By changing the flow rate of Ar N

@highlight A novel high entropy alloy MoNbHfZrTi based solar absorber coating is prepared which exhibits a high absorptance 0.934 and a low emittance 0.09 .
@highlight The coating is investigated by shifting absorption edge towards longer wavelength.
@highlight The colored coating is studied and drawn in the CIE tristimulus chromaticity diagram.
