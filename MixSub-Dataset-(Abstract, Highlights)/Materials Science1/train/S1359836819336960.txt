 Fibre reinforced composites have been increasingly used in the prefabricated building industry owing to its high strength to weight ratio ease of application and flexibility in manufacturing . FRCs can be used in PBs for both structural and non structural applications . The major hindrance for composite elements in PB is their fire performance . Depending on applications there will be different requirements for FRCs on the fire resistance and vertical flame spread . There is limited information available to structural and faade engineers designers on fire safety of FRCs especially for PBs . Therefore this paper provides the overview on the fire performance FRCs in PBs with a special focus on fibre reinforced polymer and textile reinforced concrete .
