 In this study the appropriate nano porous magnesium aluminate spinel was synthesized by self combustion route explored for the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue remained in the wastewater . The effects of gel preparation pH and calcination temperature

@highlight MgAl
@highlight obtained by combustion route was used in photocatalytic dye removal process.
@highlight The maximal yield was obtained by gel preparation in the acidic condition.
@highlight The flame combustion plays key role in the advancement of solar treatment.
@highlight The spinel displayed a nano porous structure with average pore diameter of 5nm.Approximately 94 of contaminant was removed in 40min under solar irradiation.
@highlight Approximately 94 of contaminant was removed in 40 min under solar irradiation.
