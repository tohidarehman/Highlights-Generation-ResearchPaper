 There has been a growing interest in the application of solar blind ultraviolet in fields including astronomy solar energy as well as space physics . However efficient detection of UV in this region remains difficult for most Si based detectors . The use of a spectral down converter that converts solar blind UV into visible emission that is detectable by Si based devices has been regarded as a simple but cost efficient strategy . Here Eu
