 Radiative cooling technology without any energy input and any pollutants produced has drown more and more attention . However most of the studies were conducted in the transition season of arid areas . In this work the radiative cooling performance was theoretically and experimentally explored in cooling season of the humid coastal area . The results indicated that the average deviation between the cooling and transition season in arid areas was about 18.9 while for humid areas it reached up to 53.9 . And for a clear daytime sky the average temperature drop in the transition season was about 6C while that in cooling season was only 2.7C . Additionally the tilt experiment demonstrated that strategy can improve the radiative cooling performance in cooling season of humid areas but the improvement was significantly lower than that in transition season . Subsequently the average radiative cooling potential of China was further explored and the results revealed that radiative cooling technology can meet the cooling demand of 85 areas in China . Feasible solutions to improve the poor cooling performance in humid areas were further discussed . And reducing the solar absorption and non radiative heat exchange were expected to address the challenge . Our work provides insight into radiative cooling performance in cooling season of humid areas .
