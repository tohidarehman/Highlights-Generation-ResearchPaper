 An ultrathin ZnS interfacial passivation layer was produced by atomic layer deposition in order to improve the performance of CdS quantum dot sensitized solar cells . The mutable role of the top ZnS IPL deposited after QD sensitization enhanced light absorbance by acting as an anti reflective coating resulting in increased photocurrent . The bottom ZnS IPL deposited on the TiO

@highlight ZnS interfacial passivation layer IPL grown by ALD is realized for CdS QDSSC.
@highlight The influence of IPLs on the loading behavior of SILAR QD is studied strategically.
@highlight Thermodynamic aspects ZnS IPLs and QDs are linked by means of capillarity theory.
@highlight Mutable role of ZnS IPL was understood where bottom ZnS IPL proved more effectual.
@highlight 15 and 30 increase in PCE of QDSSCs with top and bottom ZnS IPL is achieved.
