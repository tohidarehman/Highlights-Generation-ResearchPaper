 Recently the 2D perovskite layer is employed as a capping passivating layer in the perovskite solar cells . The 2D perovskite layer is prepared by inserting a large sized hydrophobic

@highlight Performed DLTS and reverse DLTS measurements for the 3D and 2D 3D PSCs.
@highlight Results correlated with admittance spectroscopy analysis.
@highlight Determined the features attributable to mobile ions in PSCs.
@highlight Evaluated the performance of the PSCs at different temperatures with DLTS analysis.
