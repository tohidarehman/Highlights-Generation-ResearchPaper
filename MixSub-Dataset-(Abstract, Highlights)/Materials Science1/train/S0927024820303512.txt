 In this paper we study a light induced degradation mechanism observed in commercial n type silicon heterojunction solar cells at elevated temperatures using dark and illuminated annealing for a broad range of illumination intensities 140 kWm

@highlight LID behaviour observed in silicon heterojunction solar cells.
@highlight Dark annealing can improve efficiency and open circuit voltage of SHJs.
@highlight The extent of degradation depends on temperature and illumination intensity.
