 Creep can be understood as the resistance of a material to a continuous stress and represents an important property for engineering design . The creep behaviour of a series of nanocomposites with electromechanical applications based on a thermoplastic elastomer poly and small amounts of graphene has been explored using cylindrical flat punch depth sensing indentation . Special attention is paid to the influence of the nature of the polymer brushes attached to the graphene surface . Common methodologies for indentation creep analysis are critically examined and brought together to provide a comprehensive picture of creep deformation . It is found that graphene significantly reduces the creep rate and this is most significant under viscoplastic deformation than in the linear viscoelastic regime . Most interesting polyethylene branches reduce visco elastic plastic flow in a more effective manner and this is attributed to the selective interaction of the filler with the matrix chains .

@highlight Viscoelastic viscoplastic behaviour can be conveniently approached by indentation.
@highlight Cylindrical punch indentation allows linear viscoelasticity to be met at low loads.
@highlight Graphene reduces the creep rate of the elastomeric matrix especially under viscoplastic flow.
@highlight Polyethylene brushes attached to graphene markedly enhance creep behaviour.
