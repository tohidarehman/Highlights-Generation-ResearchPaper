 Aluminium hybrid foam core sandwich structures with carbon fiber cold setting resin as face sheets have been made . The flexural properties and energy absorption of these sandwich structures have been analyzed through three point bending test . It is found that with the use of a double layer carbon fiber sheet the flexural load carrying capacity of the sandwich structure increases up to eight times as compared to that of bare foam structure . Whereas the bending stiffness of the structure is nine times to that of BFs and energy absorption is 58 more than that of BF . It is also found that with the increase in foam core thickness the flexural load carrying capacity bending stiffness and energy absorption capacity of the sandwich structure increases significantly . The specific strength and bending stiffness increase as compared to that of face sheet due to the addition of foam at the core . The deformation behavior of different sandwich structures was analyzed to investigate the different modes of failure during bending .

@highlight HFs with cenosphere reinforcement has been used as core for sandwich structure.
@highlight Single and double layer carbon fiber reinforced acrylic resin composite has been used as face sheet of sandwich structure.
@highlight 3PB test were conducted mechanical properties such as peak load bending stiffness and energy absorption were examined.
@highlight Investigated the effect of HFs core thickness and number of layers of carbon fiber on flexural behavior.
@highlight Mode of failure of sandwich structures under different conditions has been studied.
