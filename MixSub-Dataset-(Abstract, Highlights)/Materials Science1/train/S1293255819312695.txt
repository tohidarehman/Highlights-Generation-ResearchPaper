 Sn based electrode materials have been envisioned as an alternative to graphite owing to their high theoretical capacity . In this work we embarked on investigating the lithium electrochemical mechanisms occurring in core shell nanoparticles made of a tin metal core covered by an amorphous tin oxide shell . The electrochemical properties evaluated using galvanostatic experiments point to a dual contribution of core and shell components to the overall capacity .
