 Latent thermal energy storage plays an indispensable role in exhaust heat recycles in various industries which is useful for reducing energy consumption . Different phase change temperatures and high thermal conductivities of composite phase change materials were required for various domains . In the present work Alum as phase change material and Ala as melting point modifier a series of phase change materials with adjustable melting temperatures were prepared by physical mixing method . Moreover EG as porous skeleton and thermal conductive enhancer composite with high thermal conductivity was obtained with simple physical adsorption method . The XRD and SEM were applied to characterize the phase crystal and microstructure of the composite phase change material . DSC results revealed that phase change temperatures of Alum Ala mixtures could be adjustable from 91.11C to 74.61C and thermal conductivity of the composite was improved to 10.93Wm
