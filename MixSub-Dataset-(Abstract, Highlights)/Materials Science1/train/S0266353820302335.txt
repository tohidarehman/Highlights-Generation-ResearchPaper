 In addition to being a serious threat to aircraft safety kiss bonding is also difficult to detect using conventional non destructive testing techniques . It is the objective of this study to develop an autonomous high resolution technique to detect kiss bonds and disbonds between carbon nanotube skins and the host substrate of large scale nanocomposite structures . The newly developed automated dynamic line scan thermography approach is capable of speedy detection of contact kiss bonds as well as disbonds in laminated CNT reinforced nanocomposite .

@highlight A novel autonomous dynamic line scan thermographic inspection approach.
@highlight Fast high resolution inspection for large scale components up to 50mm s .
@highlight Results immediately available for analysis while the scanning process continues.
@highlight First reported research of infrared thermography for examining kiss bonds.
@highlight Kiss bonding inspection for carbon nanotube reinforced nanocomposites.
