 The formation of segregated structure in conductive polymer composites reveals great superiority in gaining improved electromagnetic interference shielding performance . Nevertheless the restricted processing method and seriously deteriorated mechanical properties hamper the practical applications of such segregated composites . Herein we demonstrate simultaneously improved EMI shielding and mechanical performance in a segregated carbon nanotube polypropylene composite

@highlight An eco friendly injection molding method was demonstrated to develop segregated CPC for EMI shielding.
@highlight An outstanding elongation at break was achieved.
@highlight Favorable expansibility and large scale production capacity can be implemented.
