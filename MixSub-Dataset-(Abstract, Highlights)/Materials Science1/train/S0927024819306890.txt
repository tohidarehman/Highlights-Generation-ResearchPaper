 Efficient energy band alignment of heterojunction layers in colloidal quantum dot based solar cells is a crucial factor to govern the charge transport characteristics and device performance . In this work we develop novel cascaded junctions of lead sulfide CQD triple layers consisting of an alkylammonium iodide treated PbS bilayer and a 1 3 propanedithiol treated single layer . The two AMIs

@highlight Cascaded junctions of PbS CQD layers was obtained using three different ligands.
@highlight Efficient band alignment improved charge transport and suppressed recombination.
@highlight A power conversion efficiency reached 10.46 for the cascaded junction solar cell.
