 Following the recent success of monolithically integrated Perovskite Si tandem solar cells great interest has been raised in searching for alternative wide bandgap top cell materials with prospects of a fully earth abundant stable and efficient tandem solar cell . Thin film chalcogenides such as the Cu

@highlight Si contamination during high temperature thin film chalcogenide synthesis is studied.
@highlight A thin TiN layer was used as a diffusion barrier and recombination layer.
@highlight No evidence of electrically active defects in Si after CZTS processing.
@highlight First proof of concept monolithic CZTS on Si was fabricated.
@highlight No significant loss in minority carrier lifetime of the silicon bottom cell.
