 The fuel to oxidizers ratio determines the effectiveness of combustion reaction and the amount of heat evolution . Hence optimization of F O ratio is important for the formation of phase pure ceramic powders by the solution combustion synthesis method . The present work demonstrates the effect of F O ratio on the synthesis of phase pure MgO ZnO CaO ceramic powders by SCS method and also the effect of fuels for ZnO synthesis . To understand the mechanism of the combustion reaction at different F O ratios we calculated the theoretical flame temperatures by using the thermodynamic concept and analyzed . Using this information in association with the phase content of the synthesized samples we described the role of fuel to oxidizer ratio in synthesizing ceramic materials by SCS method . We found that F O strongly controls the structural nature and characteristics of the synthesized ceramic powder products . Furthermore comparing the nature of combustion products for divalent and trivalent cation based ceramics we conclude that solution combustion synthesis favors the synthesis of trivalent cation based oxides over purely divalent cation based oxides . Our work provides the insights into the understanding and the importance of using proper fuel to oxidizer ratio in synthesizing phase pure ceramic powder by SCS method .

@highlight Fuel to oxidizer F O ratio in solution combustion synthesis SCS of CaO MgO and ZnO determines the phase purity.
@highlight For F O away from 1.0 the powder properties are controlled through incomplete combustion.
@highlight Heat of combustion decides the phase purity and crystallinity of ceramics depending on F O ratio.
@highlight F O ratio controls the particle size and the defects in ceramic materials.
@highlight SCS method suits best for ceramics containing trivalent 3 cations than divalent 2 cations.
