 Properties of the electron transport layer are known to influence the performance of lead halide perovskite solar cells . But so far very little emphasis has been given on the increased impact of this layer at low light . In this work we compare the effect of thickness and coverage of a TiO

@highlight Structural and crystalline properties of the TiO
@highlight ETL are critical to low light performance of PSCs.
@highlight Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to control the crystalline character of thin TiO
@highlight films.
@highlight Spray pyrolysis can be used to produce pinhole free crystalline TiO
@highlight compact layers.
@highlight For PSCs to reach high PCEs the TiO
@highlight compact layer must be crystalline and pin hole free.
