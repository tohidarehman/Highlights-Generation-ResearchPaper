 Among quasicrystals no semiconductor has been reported and the existence of semiconducting quasicrystal is one of the major questions in the solid state physics and a semiconducting quasicrystal is expected to be a high performance thermoelectric material . First principles calculations was performed on four real crystalline structures and hypothetical approximant crystalline and quasicrystalline structures and total energies were calculated . The formation energy of the type 1 1 cubic approximant crystal was found to be very close to the estimated value based on the approximate equation using the formation energy and abundance ratio of prolate and oblate . From this it is considered that the estimated value by the approximate equation is reliable and it is estimated that the type 1 1 cubic approximant crystal and type quasicrystal have the almost the same formation energy as the tetragonal boron phase known as metastable phase . This suggests the possibility of formation of boron quasicrystal as a metastable phase . In addition the electronic density of states was clarified in the type 1 1 cubic approximant crystal . As a result it was shown that the type 1 1 cubic approximant crystal is a semiconductor having a band gap of about 0.25 eV and it can be strongly expected that the boron quasicrystal is also a semiconductor .
