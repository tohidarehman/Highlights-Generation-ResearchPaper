 We report nanometer scale hole density imaging in As doped CdTe films by scanning capacitance microscopy . The hole density profiling is validated by contrasting a CdTe cross section sample made by molecular beam epitaxy with systematically increased As doping in a staircase pattern over the range of 10

@highlight Found one order of magnitude nonuniformity of active carrier distribution in group V doped CdTe thin film.
@highlight Proposed a root cause of the nonuniform active carrier for efficiency deficit of group V doped CdTe thin film devices.
@highlight Developed scanning capacitance microscopy SCM for imaging active carrier distribution in CdTe thin film.
@highlight Correlatively imaged active carrier electrical potential and non radiative recombination by the multiple nm scale techniques.
