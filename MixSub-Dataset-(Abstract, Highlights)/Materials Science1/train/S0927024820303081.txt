 The present work is a continuation of our earlier work in which high entropy alloy MoNbHfZrTi is used as a raw material to prepare solar absorber coating . In this work we have further investigated a novel Al MoNbHfZrTiN MoNbHfZrTiON SiO

@highlight A novel high entropy alloy MoNbHfZrTi based solar absorber coating exhibits double antireflective layers.
@highlight The CODE software is employed to calculate optical constants of individual layer and simulate the reflectance spectrum.
@highlight Failure mechanism of thermal stability and corrosion behavior are investigated in detail.
