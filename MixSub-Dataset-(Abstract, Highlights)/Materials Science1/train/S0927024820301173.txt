 Phase change material slurry with nanoparticles added has been proved to improve the performance of solar thermal storage . While it is found that previous studies have not systematically dealt with the thermo physical properties of PCM slurry based on the type and mass fraction of nanoparticles and its stability and viscosity . Therefore the purpose of this research is to experimentally evaluate the effects of nanoparticles and dispersants on the thermal physical properties of PCS and determine the role and the associated optimal mass fraction ratio of dispersants in promoting the stability of suspension . The 30 mass fraction alkyl hydrocarbon PCS was employed for our study . Three types of nanoparticles i.e . Cu Al
