 Development of latent functionally thermal fluid with excellent optical absorption and controllable heat transfer properties for direct absorption solar collector is crucial in solar thermal utilization . In this study the microcapsule with melamine formaldehyde resin shell and octadecane core was prepared via in situ polymerization as its shell was modified by reduced graphene oxide and its core was doped with oleic acid coated Fe
