 Bulk transition metal dichalcogenides are indirect gap semiconductors with optical gaps in the range of 0.71.6eV which makes them suitable for solar cell applications . In this work we study the electronic structure optical properties and the thickness dependence of the solar cell efficiencies of MX

@highlight Thickness dependent solar cell efficiency of transition metal dichalcogenides
@highlight 20 solar cell efficiency for thin films of MoTe2 and 36 solar cell efficiency for thick films of WS2
@highlight Highest solar cell efficiency is found for WS2.
@highlight With the use of an ideal anti reflective coating it is possible to reach 66 of efficiency.
