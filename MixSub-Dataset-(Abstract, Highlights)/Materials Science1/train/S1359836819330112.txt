 Much attention has been given to flexible electronic devices in recent years . Conductive polymer composites have been utilized to fabricate strain sensors owing to their lightweight and high flexibility . It is a great challenge to develop flexible and wearable strain sensors with light weight good skin affinity and gas permeability high sensitivity and excellent corrosion resistance . In this work electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane nanofibers were first decorated by graphene through ultra sonication followed by polydopamine modification and then hydrophobic treatment with 1
