 This work demonstrates the effectiveness of interfacial engineering and defect passivation in the bulk of mixed perovskite absorber to achieve high performance perovskite solar cells . It is found that the extent of

@highlight Hysteresis free perovskite solar cells PSCs with high reproducibility can be achieved by passivation engineering.
@highlight Incorporation of an organic cross linker can passivate the defects in mixed perovskite thin films.
@highlight A multilayer structure of the ETL has a superior advantage in suppressing carrier recombinations over the single layer ETL.
@highlight The synergistic effect from the optimized ETL perovskite interface and perovskite absorber enhances PSC performance.
@highlight Detailed characterizations are provided for understanding the mechanism of device performance enhancement.
