 Taking into consideration environmental issues and additive manufacturing technologies the development of advanced UV curable polymers and polymer composites is an area of increasing interest . In this scope polyurethane acrylate composites with Indium Tin Oxide were produced in order to tune morphology optical thermal mechanical and dielectric properties . It is shown that ITO particles are well dispersed within the polymer matrix and that the polymerization rate and the UV curing conversion degree are influenced by the ITO content . Moreover the optical transparency has decrease to 20 for the samples containing 10wt ITO content and the elastic modulus increases 10 for same sample . On the other hand the glass transition temperature of PUA is independent of the ITO amount . ITO PUA composites with 25wt ITO filler content presents high dielectric constant of 33 . This composite has been used for developing a capacitive sensor showing the suitability of the UV curable materials for capacitive sensing applications .

@highlight UV curable PUA ITO composites have been obtained up to 25wt filler content.
@highlight Good filler dispersion is achieved leading to a good mechanical flexibility.
@highlight The addition of ITO increases the dielectric constant up to 30.
@highlight Optical transmittance remains above 30 for composites with 5wt ITO content.
@highlight The developed composites can be used as UV curable high dielectric materials.
