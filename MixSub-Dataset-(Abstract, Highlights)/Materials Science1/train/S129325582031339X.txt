 PdxAuy loaded reduced graphene oxide on nickel foam were synthesized in a simple and green way of spontaneous reduction . Different characterization methods including XRD Raman spectra SEM TEM and XPS were used to investigated the chemical composition morphology and structure of the composites . The catalytic activity of the prepared electrodes were estimated by means of cyclic voltammetry chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy . Graphene oxide was firstly reduced by Ni foam directly and then noble metal ions were reduced by reduced graphene oxide supported on the surface of Ni substrate . By varying the palladium gold mole ratios into 4 1 5 1 and 6 1 the optimized P

@highlight The PAGN composites were prepared via a facile method of spontaneous reduction.
@highlight The composites properties changed with the atomic ratio of Pd and Au increasing.
@highlight The PAGN electrode showed excellent activity as the atomic ratio of Pd and Au is 5 1.
@highlight The P
@highlight GN electrode exhibited exceptional stability for methanol ethanol oxidation.
