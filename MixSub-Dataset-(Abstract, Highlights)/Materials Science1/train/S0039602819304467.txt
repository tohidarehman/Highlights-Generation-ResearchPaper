 The interactions of water with synthesized mesoporous ceria nanoparticles are studied as a function of temperature at two water vapor partial pressures using

@highlight Molecular water and water dissociation coexist on surfaces of ordered mesoporous ceria nanopowder.
@highlight Six IR vibrational bands for surface hydroxyls exist on mesoporous ceria at temperature from 25
@highlight C to 400
@highlight C.
@highlight Water adsorption on mesoporous ceria is 90 reproducible and active sites for water adsorption are recoverable after 4 cycles of heating from 25
@highlight C to 400 C in 60h.
