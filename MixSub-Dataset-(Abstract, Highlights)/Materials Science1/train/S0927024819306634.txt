 Smart windows with reversible regulation on solar radiation by altering their optical transmittance in response to thermal stimuli have been developed as a promising solution toward reducing energy consumption of buildings . This work presents a new strategy for doping Ag nanorods with poly hydrogel to achieve atmospheric window full wavelength thermal management . PNIPAm as basic material was aimed to achieve solar radiation modulation among visible near infrared and middle infrared region . Acrylic was grafted on PNIPAm chains to enhance mechanical strength . While Ag NRs were the major factors that affected solar radiation modulation due to its structural changes driven by PNIPAm phase transition . The hybrid hydrogel showed a relatively high solar modulation ability T

@highlight The hydrogel showed enhanced solar modulation abilities in atmospheric window full wavelength.
@highlight Both acrylic and Ag NRs have a significant effect on transmittance modulation.
@highlight The hydrogel was stable and with no degradation of modulation under phase transition.
@highlight Window device filled with hydrogel showed a significant temperature decrease under light condition.
