 Characterization of doped silicon layers using infrared spectroscopy is a fast and non destructive method but data interpretation requires proper simulation and modelling of the free carrier absorption in the mid infrared wavelength range . This work demonstrates an optical model capable of describing the infrared reflectance and transmittance of silicon solar wafers with pyramidal texture and doped layers . The model s ability to accurately describe a broad variety of samples is discussed .
