 To facilitate a single element with the promoted dual sensing and actuation functionality compared to the conventional individual sensors and actuators different kinds of piezoelectric structures should be evaluated . Here finite element method simulations together with some aspects of the nanotechnology afforded an opportunity to simplify structure tailoring of the high performance sensor actuator single element . First we prepared ultrathin shell poly aligned hollow nanofibers . This geometrically confined nanostructure with low dielectric constant of 3.6 efficiently increased strain yielded to enlarge the piezoelectric voltage by 250 bending actuation by 38 and the phase content by 18 when compared to the random solid nanofibers . Second 108 increase in sensitivity from 450mV N to 940mV N and 21 increase in piezoelectric actuation from 14.8m to 18m obtained by addition of 0.05wt carbon nanotubes to PVDF aligned hollow nanofibers . Taking advantage of this hollow nanocomposite structure 45 improvement in crystallinity 263 enhancement in elastic modulus and complete removal of the nonpolar phase were occurred . The sensor actuator single element would guarantee the adaptability interconnectedness and autonomy of the next generation robots allow the size weight and cost of the system to be re evaluated .
