 In the present study clinoptilolite nanoparticles were prepared in a planetary ball mill instrument and ion exchanged in Fe solution . The resulted FeCN material was then used as an effective modifier to modify carbon paste electrode . When the resulted FeCN CPE electrode was immersed in HCl supporting electrolyte Fe cations were located at the electrode solution interface via an ion exchange process with protons which were present in the supporting electrolyte solution . Next Fe cations could be immediately oxidized to Fe at the electrode surface by scanning the potential toward more positive values in order to create an anodic peak current . When Sn cations were added into the supporting electrolyte solution they could immediately react with the produced Fe cations as well . This reaction provided more Fe cations at the electrode solution interface causing a significant increase in the peak current of the electro oxidation of Fe cations . Hence this electrocatalytic current was utilized for the voltammetric determination of Sn in aqueous solution . In addition the experimental design by response surface methodology was applied to study the interaction effects between the influencing variables . Further the best voltammetric response was obtained by performing the voltammetric measurement based on the run with conditions of pH 2
