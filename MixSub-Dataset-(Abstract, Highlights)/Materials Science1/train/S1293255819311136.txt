 The single phase of the chabazite was artificially synthesized in the absence of organic structure directing agents and a seed crystal . The CHA showed a high selectivity of 91.2 for Cs ions in sea water which was superior to 87.1 of the synthesized mordenite . The single phase of the merlinoite was obtained by lack of a fluoride source . The Cs adsorption performance for the MER was 83.1 in the seawater . The CHA was heat treated for the immobilization of the Cs in the decomposed zeolite . For the non heated sample ca . 1.2 Cs ion from all of the adsorbed Cs was eluted by a dissolution test in deionized water for 14 days . The Cs ion did not elute when the sample was heated at 1000C and higher temperature due to the Cs containment in the amorphous phase .

@highlight We Chabazite CHA was synthesized using chemical reagents in absence of organic structure directing agents and seed crystal.
@highlight The Cs selectivity in the seawater was superior for the CHA compared with those of merlinoite MER and mordenite MOR .
@highlight The Cs ion did not elute when the CHA was heated at 1000C and higher temperature.
