 Hydrogels mimic the tissue environment because of their hydrophilic and porous network structures . They are widely investigated in biomedical and biotechnological fields however due to the poor mechanical properties and limited functions their further applications are restricted . In order to tackle these problems an emerging approach is focused on the development of nanocomposite hydrogels . Numerous nanoparticles including carbon based silica polymeric and metal based nanoparticles have been incorporated into hydrogels . The combination of the two different materials results in a hybrid material with synergistic properties of both components . Nanocomposite hydrogels are designed to possess superior physicochemical and biological properties . Therefore they are rapidly developing new materials which have predominant applications in biological and material sciences . In this manuscript we intended to summarize recent development in the nanocomposite hydrogels and their applications in the biomedical field .
