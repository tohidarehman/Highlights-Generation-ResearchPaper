 This paper describes a manufacturing method for the ribs of a cylindrical anisogrid composite structure without an outer skin . This research presents two direct compression techniques for the ribs during wet filament winding with T700 continuous carbon fiber tows . In addition the strength of the helical rib manufactured using the proposed compression process was compared to that of the manufactured rib that did not use the compression process . The average compressive strength of the helical rib manufactured using the proposed methods is 394 Mpa and 247MPa according to the failure mode respectively . Although the ribs manufactured using the proposed method did not show increase in strength decreases in the standard deviation for both compressive failure modes and was observed . Thus the proposed compression techniques resulted in compression strength stabilizing thanks to decreasing void content . Furthermore structural stiffness was indirectly evaluated and it was found that the improvement was over 150 .
