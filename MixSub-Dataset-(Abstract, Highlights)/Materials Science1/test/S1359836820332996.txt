 A novel one step flame synthesis method was used to coat carbon nanotubes onto plain weave S glass fibre fabrics . Nickel chloride as a catalyst was applied on the GF fabrics and CNTs were formed in an ethanol flame . Results showed that different carbon materials were synthesised and they were sensitive to the flame synthesis parameters . Short CNTs were dominant with a low catalyst concentration of 0.2mol L and long CNTs started to appear when the catalyst was increased to 0.4 and 0.6mol L. With even higher catalyst concentration at 0.8 and 1.0mol L most of the CNTs were embedded in a thick layer of carbon soot . In addition the thermal and electrical conductivities of GF epoxy and multi scale CNT GF epoxy composites were measured . Compared to GF epoxy composite a more than 40 increase of thermal conductivity and 10 orders of magnitude decrease of electrical resistance were achieved in these multi scale CNT GF epoxy composites .

@highlight CNTs were successfully synthesised in an ethanol flame and coated onto glass fibres.
@highlight Catalyst concentration influenced significantly the composition of the synthesised carbon materials.
@highlight The multi scale CNTs glass fibre composite laminates exhibited enhanced thermal and electrical conductivities.
