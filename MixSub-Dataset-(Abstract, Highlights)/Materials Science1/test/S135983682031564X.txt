 Efficient anti icing techniques are of great implications in many fields of our society . In this work multi functional copolymers containing siloxane units are designed to prepare durable anti icing coating . The presence of siloxane groups endows the copolymers with triggered self crosslinking ability strong self adhesiveness and high structural stability in severe conditions which further enhanced the mechanical chemical durability of the composite coatings . The optimal composite coating containing 40wt copolymer and 60wt fluorinated silicon dioxide exhibits excellent water repellency with contact angle beyond 160 and sliding angle below 2 . The water freezing time can be postponed to 1765sat 20C in concrete with the ice adhesion strength as low as 68.1kPa . More impressively the performance of this anti icing coating can be well maintained even after over 110 cycles sandpaper abrasion at 2.5kPa and 20 icing deicing cycles or immerging in various corrosive organic conditions for more than 10 days . The composite coatings can be well applied on surfaces with diverse properties such as metal ceramics glass and polymer for a myriad of anti icing applications .
