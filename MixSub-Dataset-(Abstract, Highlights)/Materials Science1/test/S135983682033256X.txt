 Large dielectric loss and low energy storage efficiency are common problems of poly and its copolymers based energy storage dielectrics which has limited their applications . To solve these problems linear dielectric polymethyl methacrylate with low intrinsic dielectric loss was chosen as the interlayers of P to form the multilayer structure dielectric . A small amount of silicon dioxide coated Ba
