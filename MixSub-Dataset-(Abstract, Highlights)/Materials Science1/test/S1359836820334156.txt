 In this work the feasibility of converting dead leaf biomass into green activated carbon for use as a reinforcement filler in natural rubber composites was assessed . The dead leaf activated carbon was prepared by pyrolysis at 550 700 900 and 1000C at a heating rate of 10C min

@highlight From dead leaf biomass to Dead leaf activated carbon DLAC by pyrolysis.
@highlight Potential use of DLAC as reinforcement filler in natural rubber.
@highlight DLAC filled rubber give similar mechanical properties to carbon black filled rubber.
@highlight DLAC is a promising cost effective to commercial carbon black in rubber composites.
