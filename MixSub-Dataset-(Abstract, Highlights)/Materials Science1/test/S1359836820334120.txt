 Thermosetting polymers and composites featuring chemical cross linking are usually regarded as unrecyclable . Recently novel thermosets containing dynamic chemical bonds or labile bonds have been developed to achieve chemical recycling under mild conditions via solvent assisted exchange or cleavage reactions . This concept has been extended to recycle conventional thermosets and composites using a proper catalyst solvent system by selective bond cleavage . In this paper we develop a modeling framework to probe into the complicated reaction diffusion coupling and reveal the effect of reinforcement such as carbon fiber on the dissolution process of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy . A model involving chemical species concentration dependent diffusion and reaction rates is developed to inquire into the evolution of different functional group concentrations and network structure via solvent assisted exchange reactions . We further apply the reaction diffusion based model to a multiphase structure to simulate the CFRE dissolution process . The model is experimentally validated by the mass evolution of a virgin cured epoxy anhydride resin matrix in an alcohol catalyst solution proceeding with transesterification . The established model can predict the influence of dissolution processing parameters including catalyst concentration and solvent diffusivity . Parametric studies are used to further assess the structural parameters of fiber loading on the dissolution rate . This work provides a deep understanding on the dissolution of thermosets and their fiber reinforced composites and can guide the future engineering application of sustainable recycling approaches of thermosets and composites .
