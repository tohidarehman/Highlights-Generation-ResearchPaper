 The present article deals with the tribology of very important family of high performance polymers known as Poly comprising of mainly two members viz . PEEK and PAEK since other members are not yet researched for tribology . Interestingly PEEK is extensively explored and PAEK is under explored . The article deals with the tribology of composites of these two polymers containing nano particles of solid lubricants leading to significant enhancement in the tribo potential . The article discusses the systematic efforts to develop high potential tribo materials based on PAEK and right kind of reinforcement and combination of two solid lubricants . The first one called primary SL was graphite which was essential part of all composites . The only difference in the series of composites was of type of secondary SL and its size . The tribo investigations brought out various features such as synergism between the two SLs edge of NPs over MPs and very high tribo potential not reported in the literature . The unique efforts to convert the scientific knowledge into the product and to identify the extent of loss in performance during the journey from material to product are also reported .
