 Metal phenylphosphonate piperazine reduced graphene oxide nanomaterials with different metal centers were facilely synthesized . We found that the morphology of metal organophosphorus was controlled by the coordinated metal centers trivalent metal organophosphorus exhibited nanosheet morphology while divalent metal organophosphorus displayed nanorod morphology . In addition the role of metal centers on the flame safety and mechanical performance of epoxy resin were studied . The limiting oxygen index values of EP composites with only 3wt of additive were increased in different levels and the MPhP PGO EP composites all pass UL 94 V 0 rating which was owing to the multi coordinating effect . Specifically we verified that P element of MPhP PGO could act on both condensed and gas phase while MPhP PGO only acted in the condensed phase thus MPhP PGO EP showed better enhancing effect on flame retardancy of EP . Beyond that MPhP PGO EP displayed more excellent mechanical properties is due to MPhP which had good reinforcement effect to EP matrix .

@highlight In situ growth of metal organophosphorus nanosheet rod on graphene was proposed.
@highlight The morphology of metal organophosphorus was controlled by the metal centers.
@highlight 3wt MPhP PGO endowed epoxy resin excellent fire safety and mechanical properties.
@highlight The synergistic effect mechanism of metal and phosphorus was investigated.
