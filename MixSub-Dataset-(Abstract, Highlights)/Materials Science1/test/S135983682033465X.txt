 We present a nonlinear multiscale modeling and simulation framework for the mechanical design of machine knitted textiles with functionally graded microstructures . The framework operates on the mesoscale where yarns intermesh into stitch patterns and the macroscale where these repetitive stitch patterns are composed into a fabric . On the mesoscale representative unit cells consisting of single interlocked yarn loops modeled as geometrically exact nonlinear elastic 3D beams are homogenized to compute their effective mechanical properties . From this data a B Spline response surface model is generated to represent the nonlinear orthotropic constitutive behavior on the macroscale where the fabric is modeled by a nonlinear KirchhoffLove shell formulation and discretized using isogeometric finite elements . These functionally graded textiles with locally varying properties can be designed and analyzed by parameterizing the stitch value i.e . the loop length of a single jersey stitch and the knitting direction as mesoscopic design variables of the macroscopic response surface constitutive model . To validate the multiscale simulation and design approach numerical results are compared against physical experiments of different tensile loading cases for various grading scenarios . Furthermore the versatility of the method for the design of functionally graded textiles is demonstrated .
