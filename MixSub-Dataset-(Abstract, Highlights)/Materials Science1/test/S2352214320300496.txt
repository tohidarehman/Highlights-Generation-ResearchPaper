 Using our recently developed theoretical inverse design method a new series of branched oligothiophene molecules for photovoltaic donors are designed . PooMa uses a genetic algorithm to screen a huge pool of compounds combined with a fast electronic structure method with reasonable accuracy . Here we apply this inverse design method to identify a set of 20 branched oligothiophene systems with promisingly high efficiencies by using a Quantitative Structure Property Relation model based on five electronic descriptors that describe the performance of organic solar cells . We consider a pool of oligomers that are modified by attaching to each of 7 different sites one out of 22 functional groups i.e . a pool of 22
