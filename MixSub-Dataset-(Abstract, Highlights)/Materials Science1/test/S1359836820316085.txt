 Due to the hydrophilic nature of the aluminophosphate adhesives their application in the wood based board industries is rarely considered . Herein the AP adhesives with reduced graphene oxide

@highlight The synthesis of AP adhesive is featured with simplicity and environment friendliness.
@highlight A hydrophobic interface was constructed by using rGO nanosheets.
@highlight The
@highlight could provide good interfacial adhesion by the covalent and hydrogen bond connections.
@highlight The
@highlight possess favorable mechanical and fire resistant performance.
