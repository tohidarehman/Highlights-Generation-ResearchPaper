 Advanced biocomposites reinforced by abundant biomass derived fillers can add a revenue stream to enhance the economic viability of biofuel production chains and the energy efficiency of the composite industry . However the low stiffness of biopolymers limits their use in structural applications . Poplar fibers mesh size 180m

@highlight A small amount of amino acid improved the fiber PLA interfacial adhesion.
@highlight Poplar PLA composites with 0.1wt lysine exhibited best tensile strength and modulus.
@highlight Poplar PLA composites with 0.1wt lysine exhibited superior rheology for 3D printing.
@highlight A proposed mechanism in composites chain extension cross linking and degradation.
