 In order to improve the flame retardancy while maintaining the excellent mechanical properties and heat resistance of epoxy resin a novel P N S containing high efficiency flame retardant named TAP was designed and synthesized by a simple one pot reaction among 2 thenaldehyde 2 aminobenzothiazole and 9 10 dihydro 9 oxa 10 phosphaphenanthrene 10 oxide . The chemical structure of TAP was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy

@highlight A novel P N S containing heterocyclic halogen free flame retardant TAP for epoxy resin was synthesized.
@highlight TAP endows epoxy resin with high efficiency flame retardancy.
@highlight Flame retardant EP maintains excellent heat resistance and mechanical properties.
