 Silicone rubber plays an irreplaceable role in biomedicine and aerospace applications due to its biocompatibility flexibility and excellent stability in extreme harsh conditions . However only a few studies focus on SR based shape memory materials and the increasing intelligent applications of SR materials are limited by the insufficient strength and poor designable recovery behavior . Herein we report a simple method via monomers prepolymers blend and in situ polymerization cross linking to prepare thermal responsive shape memory silicone rubber composites with three transition temperatures . In the SRCs poly and poly are used as switching segments and reinforced phase polydimethylsiloxane networks provide a third transition and dominate the permanent shape . In a thermal stimulus recovery of SRCs with PMMA and PEMA switching segments are used second temporary shapes can be precisely designed by just tuning the proportions of PMMA and PEMA and a practical linear relationship between recovered scale and PEMA content is built . The shape memory and mechanical properties of SRCs are both enhanced by micro nano particles of PMMA and PEMA . The SRCs present excellent thermal stability hydrophobicity and hygroscopicity . The triple shape memory SRC materials have potential applications in smart materials and actuators .

@highlight Thermal responsive triple shape memory silicone rubber composites SRCs were prepared and domains at 800nm were achieved.
@highlight Second temporary shapes were precisely designed by tuning PEMA proportions in the SRCs.
@highlight The SRCs exhibit service temperature over 220C water CA around 120 and water absorption lower than 0.1 .
@highlight Mechanical 8.4MPa and shape memory properties were reinforced by particles of PMMA PEMA.
