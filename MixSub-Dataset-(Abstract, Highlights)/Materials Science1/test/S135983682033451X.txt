 Underwater vibration detectors have aroused intensive attention due to the promising applications in personal security environmental protection and military defense . However how to enable an underwater detector with combined feature of excellent structural flexibility and robustness as well as high detection sensitivity and stability still remains a significant challenge . Herein we successfully designed and developed a pitch modulated spring with photoelectric response to its tiny deformation via intercalating hydrogenated TiO

@highlight Underwater microvibration detector was designed and fabricated by a relatively compact H TiO
@highlight  graphene spring.
@highlight The intercalated spring architecture enabled high photoelectric response fast recoverability and prominent stability.
@highlight The spring detector delivered high sensitivity and stability in monitoring underwater microvibration.
