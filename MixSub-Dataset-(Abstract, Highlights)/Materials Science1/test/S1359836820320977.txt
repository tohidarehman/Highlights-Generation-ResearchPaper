 The development of poly composites having flame retardancy tensile toughness and transparency is the state of the art which requires meticulous selection and combination of additives . To achieve this goal an ionic liquid tetrabutylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate is synthesized and used as a synergist for ammonium polyphosphate . Due to the high synergistic effect between them only 1.5wt IL and 1.5wt APP can endow PLA with fire safety i.e . limiting oxygen index of 27.2 UL 94 V 0 rating and low heat release rate of 290kWm
