 One component epoxy adhesives in which the epoxy resin and curing agent are premixed have many commercial advantages including reduced working time and stable performance . However these adhesives suffer from a short shelf life even at room temperature . Here core shell structured curing agents were prepared via a dry particle coating process that improved the storage stability of one component epoxy adhesives . The DPC process is a simple economic and solvent free method to fabricate core shell structured materials using mechanical forces . Graphene nanoplatelets were used as encapsulating materials due to their high thermal conductivity and large surface areas . With the GNP encapsulated curing agents a one component epoxy adhesive displayed significantly enhanced storage stability while maintaining its fast curing behavior . In particular the pot life of the adhesive increased to 60 days which is over two times longer than that of a pristine epoxy adhesive . The curing temperature increased by up to 5.6C which is a smaller increase than that observed when non thermally conductive materials were used for encapsulation . Furthermore the GNPs provided reinforcement in the cured epoxy adhesive thereby improving the lap shear strength by 2030 .
