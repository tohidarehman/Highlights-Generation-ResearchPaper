 Nanoparticle enabled strategies to combat antimicrobial resistant bacteria are highly demanded which hopefully can overcome the barriers associated with conventional antibiotics to achieve high therapeutic efficacy by improving pharmacokinetics . Here we report the controlled fabrication of multiple Ag nanoparticles containing ZIF 8 derived hollow Zn O Si nanospheres with mesoporous wall Ag

@highlight AgNPs were dispersed in hollow Zn O Si nanospheres with mesoporous framework.
@highlight Zn synergistically improved the antimicrobial activities of AgNPs against MRSA.
@highlight The Boomerang nanoantibiotic released and recaptured Ag
@highlight to reduce Ag
@highlight toxicity.
@highlight The composite outperforms silver sulfadiazine in treating MRSA infection
