 Sustainable thermosetting polyurethane anticorrosive coatings based on renewable biomass resources with long lasting corrosion protection is highly desired . Herein thermosetting lignin based polyurethanes coatings with superior corrosion resistance and high content of lignin were prepared by polymerization of lignin based polyol with hexamethylene diisocyanate in absence of catalysts . In order to increase the reactivity and solubility of OH EL when reacting with isocyanates the phenolic hydroxyls of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin were selectively converted to primary aliphatic hydroxyls by sequential alkylation and thiol ene reaction . Due to the well dispersion and crosslinking reactivity of OH EL in the polyurethane networks the resulting LPUs presented high thermal stability and excellent mechanical properties . Remarkably LPU 3 with the content of OH EL of 54.8wt exhibited high T
