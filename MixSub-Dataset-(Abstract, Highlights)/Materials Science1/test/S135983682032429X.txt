 As an important inorganic material geopolymer has been widely used for ceramics and sustainable cement in concrete . Sodium aluminosilicate hydrate gel known as the zeolite precursor gel has the most critical impact on the performance of geopolymer . The nano micromechanical properties of N A S H have been investigated in several studies but the resutls are always inconsistent . A novel compromise approach using Maximum Likelihood Estimation for deconvolution of nanoindentation data is introduced to fundamentally further understand this issue in this study . Correlation and difference of different statistical techniques are compared to clarify the rationality of this method . Multiple characterization techniques including microstructure observation at micro and nano scale element analysis and crystal identification are applied to reveal the mechanisms . The results indicate that the elastic modulus and hardness of the N A S H gel in geopolymer under different silica modulus and curing conditions vary in a small range from 10.50 to 14.30GPa and from 0.40 to 0.57GPa respectively . When applying statistical nanoindentation in geopolymer two kinds of spurious phases mixed phases and sub phases are unavoidable . For the MLE method adopted the errors generated from analytical technique were estimated to be only 0.68 and 0.13GPa for elastic modulus and hardness respectively .

@highlight A compromise approach was proposed for the accuracy of gel phase by introducing spurious phases for other components.
@highlight Errors from analytical technique were estimated from two aspects of the average method and number of data.
@highlight For GMM increasing the components enables the model to reflect more details of the collected data distribution.
@highlight Micromechanical properties vary in a minor range of 10.5014.30 GPa for modulus and 0.400.57 GPa for hardness.
@highlight Interaction of the involved range produces a mixed phase in deconvolution which decreased the N A S H proportion.
