 In this study a layer by layer method was adopted to firstly fabricate superoleophobic superhydrophilic photocatalytic and flame retardant polyethylene terephthalate fabric . The fabric obtained self extinguished fire retardance through alternative adsorption of charged branched poly phytic acid and ammonium polyphosphate and this was achieved by repeated assembly of only two bilayers . The coating solution consisting of fluorosurfactant with negative charge and TiO

@highlight Superoleophobic and flame retardant PET fabrics were fabricated via layer by layer method.
@highlight Self extinguished flame retardance was obtained through assembling only two bilayers.
@highlight The PET fabrics efficiently separated oil water mixtures oil in water emulsions.
@highlight The PET fabrics presented photocatalytic capability both in air and under water.
@highlight The PET fabrics owned high recyclability.
