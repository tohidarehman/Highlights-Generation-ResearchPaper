 Carbon fibers with high axial stiffness and strength have been used to reinforce polymer matrix materials in advanced composites . However these fibers exhibit large anisotropies in the radial and axial directions . In addition limited data has been reported on the elastic properties of fibers in other directions than longitudinal and transversal directions and on the relationship between elastic properties and fiber structures . In this study we prepared five epoxy composites each containing a different type of carbon fiber and used a nanoindentation method in combination with finite element analysis to investigate five elastic constants of the carbon fibers . The results demonstrate that the crystallite size and the orientation of its graphite crystal inclusions affect the elastic constants

@highlight Five elastic constants were investigated for different carbon fibers through nanoindentation.
@highlight Relationships between elastic constants and crystalline structures are discussed.
@highlight Crystallite size and orientation affect the transverse and longitudinal elastic moduli.
@highlight The shear modulus is influenced by the interlayer spacing and crystallite size.
