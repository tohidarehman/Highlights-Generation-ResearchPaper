 A fundamental understanding of pure shear failure is important in elucidating the failure characteristics of woven thermoplastic composites . This work presents a novel S specimen design and an associated methodology for testing pure in plane shear failure in composites . The technique has been experimentally tested with woven thermoplastic composites which have complex failure evolution in shear due to their weave architecture . Four different composites were considered to demonstrate the scope of the technique application with various combinations of weave matrix and fibre . A Digital Image Correlation system integrated with the hemispherical testing device validated that shear strain was the dominant strain in the failure region . From this work it is evident that shear failure morphology varies between the tested composites based on the differences in their weave architecture and fibre and matrix properties . Additional Finite Element Analysis showed that neither bending nor friction hindered the tests ability to produce pure shear in the specimen . This new shear specimen provides a means of inducing shear failure utilising the hemispherical dome apparatus currently used for composite forming studies and failure analysis of other deformation modes between uniaxial and equi biaxial tension .
