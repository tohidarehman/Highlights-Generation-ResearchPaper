 It is always a challenge to improve the flame retardancy of poly without uncompromised mechanical properties transparency and other properties . In this research an organic inorganic hybrid strategy to prepare flame retardant PMMA with satisfying thermal stability mechanical properties and transparency is reported . A new reactive phosphorus containing monomer is copolymerized with methyl methacrylate to provide flame retardant function and meanwhile octa vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane serves as a reinforcer is chemically combined with the copolymer . The organic inorganic hybrid copolymerized nanocomposite with 10mol MDP and 0.5mol V POSS shows significantly enhanced limiting oxygen index decreased heat release rate compared with PMMA . The flame retardant mechanisms are analyzed and discussed in detail . Additionally its initial decomposition temperature is increased by 42C showing higher thermal stability . The terpolymer also exhibits greatly improved mechanical property due to the introduction of V POSS and its tensile strength young s modulus and impact strength are much higher than those of MMA MDP copolymer . Finally it also keeps good optical property comparable to PMMA . As a result Our research provides an effective way to prepare intrinsic flame retardant PMMA with good comprehensive performance .
