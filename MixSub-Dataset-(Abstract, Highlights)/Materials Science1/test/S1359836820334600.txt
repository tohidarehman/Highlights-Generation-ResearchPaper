 High performance polymer fibers have broad applications in composites due to high strength and excellent toughness . However the enhancement in tensile strength often results in a decrease in elongation at break and simultaneous increase of strength and toughness is still challenging for aramid fiber . Herein an effective method based on relaxation time theory is proposed to simultaneously enhance the tensile strength and elongation at break for heterocyclic aramid fiber . Ultra high molecular weight heterocyclic aramid was added in the heterocyclic aramid spinning dope to prepare fibers . The structure evolution of fiber is studied in detail combining with experiment and simulation . Results of Molecular Dynamics simulations prove that HMPBIA acts as a role of mainstay by maintaining straight chain conformation in highly oriented fibers . This unique mainstay body structure weaken slippage between molecular chains when the fiber is subject to tension . Further characterizations by small angle X ray scattering and scanning electron microscope confirm the formation of mainstay body structure in the fiber which improves tensile strength and elongation at break by 17.7 and 16.7 respectively .

@highlight HMPBIA is added into the spinning solution and it doesn t lead to too high viscosity while ensuring compatibility.
@highlight The orientation evolution of fibers was studied from the point of relaxation time of macromolecular chains.
@highlight HMPBIA plays a role like a mainstay in PBIA fiber which helps to increase the average length of fibrils.
@highlight Enhanced tensile strength and elongation at break of PBIA fiber are simultaneously realized.
