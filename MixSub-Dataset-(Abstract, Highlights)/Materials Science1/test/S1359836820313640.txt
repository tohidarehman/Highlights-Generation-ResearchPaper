 Sound insulation materials in the traditional sense are rigid which are usually dense and bulky while common porous materials have almost no sound insulation ability . Herein a fiber based flexible porous composite is presented as sound insulator fabricated via single sided coating finishing on the one side of a nonwoven framework and has been demonstrated for high performance noise reduction . The enhanced acoustic insulation is identified to be structure dependent of the area density and microstructure of the sound insulator and the type of filler . The flexible sound insulator exhibits 100 enhancement in broadband acoustic insulation over the whole frequency range compared to the bare nonwovens . And the most sound transmission loss of at the peak is up to 37dB which is about 30 times that of bare nonwovens . Furthermore the novel sound insulator has an admirable dual gradient structure in which the concentration gradient of coating finishing agent is opposite to the pore gradient . Therefore sound insulation capacity of the sound insulator exhibits obviously anisotropy according to the incident direction of sound waves . This flexible porous material for broad band sound insulation has an easy and inexpensive scalable production demonstrating its great potential for lightweight requirements for specific applications .
