 Promising three dimensional porous scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering should both function as conductive substrates to adapt to the electroactive nature of the myocardium and modulate the excessive reactive oxygen species microenvironment after myocardial infarction . In this study glutathione is grafted to the terminal carboxyl groups of carboxyl capped aniline pentamer forming AP GSH that is then introduced into gelatin scaffold to create a composite scaffold combining both conductivity and antioxidant activity . Results suggest that the Gel AP GSH composite scaffolds exhibit high porosity homogeneous pore structure and high swelling behaviors . The conductivity of the Gel AP GSH scaffold ranges from 3.410

@highlight An anti oxidative and conductive composite scaffold were prepared.
@highlight The composite scaffold showed excellent mechanical strength conductive activity and antioxidant properties.
@highlight The scaffold can decrease the oxidative stress damage in cells.
@highlight The scaffold can support the adhesion and cardiomyogenic differentiation of BADSCs.
