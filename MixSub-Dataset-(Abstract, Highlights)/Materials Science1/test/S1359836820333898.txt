 Different from conventional materials materials with negative Poisson s ratios expand laterally when stretched longitudinally . Known as auxetic materials the effect means they possess particularly fascinating properties which have recently attracted considerable attention in the literature . A range of auxetic materials has been discovered theoretically designed and fabricated . Developments in additive manufacturing techniques enable fabrication of materials with intricate cellular architectures . This paper outlines recent progress in the development of auxetic materials and structures and their mechanical properties under quasi static and dynamic loading are analysed and summarised . Limited experimental studies on 3D printed auxetic materials and structures are given more attention ahead of extensively finite element simulations . A special focus is dedicated to their large plastic deformation behaviour and energy absorption performance which should be stressed in their engineering applications no review paper has yet been found regarding this . Finally this paper provides an overview of current study limitations and some future research is envisaged in terms of auxetic materials and structures nano auxetics and additive manufacturing .
