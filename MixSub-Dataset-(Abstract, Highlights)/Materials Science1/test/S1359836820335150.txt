 Balanced electrical conductivity and mechanical properties are always of great significance for the practical applications of conductive polymer composites especially for the inherent brittle poly based CPCs . Herein the phase control methodology and intense extensional flow field synergistically induced PLA crystallization was proposed to achieve the in situ electrically conductive nanohybrid shish that is composed of plenty of CNTs coated by PLA crystalline phase . In addition the conductive networks were easily constructed by the combined effect of 1 D wire like conductive nanohybrid shish and 2 D patch board like graphene for highly conductive PLA CNT GE nanocomposites . Compared with common pure PLA 4.210
