 A three dimensional Finite Element Analysis model incorporating an elastic plastic damage model which was implemented as a user defined material sub routine in a FEA code is developed to simulate the impact response of carbon fibre reinforced plastic composites . The model predicts the load versus time and the load versus displacement responses of the composite during the impact event . Further it predicts the extent shape and direction of any intralaminar damage and interlaminar delaminations i.e . interlaminar cracking as a function of the depth through the thickness of the impacted CFRP test specimen as well as the extent of permanent indention caused by the impactor striking the composite plate . To validate the model experimental results are obtained from relatively low velocity impact tests on CFRP plates employing either a matrix of a thermoplastic polymer i.e . poly or a thermosetting epoxy polymer . The 3 D EP model that has been developed is shown to model successfully the experimentally measured impact behaviour of the CFRP composites .
