 In this research prediction of mechanical properties of short fiber reinforced composites manufactured with the help of fused filament fabrication process is investigated . Three scale formulation of asymptotic homogenization is employed to upscale the properties from microscale to mesoscale and from mesoscale to macroscale . Since generating microscale representative volume element infused with short fibers requires sophisticated modeling tools the algorithm for the microscale RVE generation is presented and discussed . Homogenization was performed for microscale RVEs with random and aligned fiber orientations and for mesoscale RVEs with unidirectional and 0 90 layup formation . Tensile tests were performed for different short carbon fiber concentrations 5 7.5 and 10 to validate predicted homogenized properties . Moreover to analyze the morphology of 3D printed specimens microstructural analysis using SEM was performed on all the printed specimens . Surface morphology helped to gain more insight into the bead structure and fiber distribution . It was concluded that Young s modulus prediction using random fiber orientation has low relative errors tested in bead direction . Overall this study has unique contribution to mechanical property prediction for FFF made short fiber reinforced composite parts .
