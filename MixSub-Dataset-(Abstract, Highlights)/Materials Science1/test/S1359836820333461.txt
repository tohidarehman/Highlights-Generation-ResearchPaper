 We produce balsa based structures by selective removal of lignin . The changes that occur in the main components of balsa upon delignification including tracheids closed pits and tylosis vessels allow the development of mesopores and a substantial increase in fluid permeability . Such system is ideally suited as a support of phase change materials PCM . Vacuum assisted impregnation with polyethylene glycol results in a form stable PCM system . The FPCM displays a high encapsulating capacity at temperatures above the melting PEG transition with a latent heat of 134J g and low supercooling . The results are rationalized by the affinity between the unidirectional mesoporous structure and the PCM polymer involving capillary forces and hydrogen bonding . The leakage proof FPCM outperforms available systems supported on minerals or other wood species . Compared to the latter group the results obtained with balsa relate to its morphology and the effect of residual hemicelluloses in hierarchically aligned cellulose nano and microfibrils . The FPCMs resist compressive loads and performs stably for at least 200 cycles of heating and cooling . An insignificant loss in latent heat is observed compared to that of pure PEG . The phase transition temperature fluctuation and non leaking characteristics under load make the balsa based FPCM a superior alternative for passive heating cooling especially for uses at high ambient temperatures . The reversible thermoregulatory capacity low cost high efficiency renewability and operability of the balsa supported FPCM indicate an excellent option for thermal energy storage and conversion devices .
