 Multiwalled carbon nanotube dispersed polyamide 66 nanocomposites were fabricated by melt mixing pretreated MWCNTs and PA66 and the effects of pretreating techniques and types of pretreating materials were investigated . The non fluffy method and the dry coating method were studied to determine the effects of pretreatment techniques . The tensile properties were enhanced by the NFM . However the DCM improved the stability of the process which greatly decreased the coefficient of variation of the physical properties . To examine the effects of pretreatment materials an epoxy modifier a fluorosurfactant and a silane coupling agent triethoxysilane APTES were evaluated . Compared with DGEBF FSO100 and APTES noticeably improved the tensile properties . However DGEBF provided highly stable physical properties . Furthermore the relationship between the stability of physical properties and MWCNT dispersion was investigated . Dispersion was quantified in terms of the dispersion ratio which was determined by Voronoi diagram analysis . The dispersion ratio was inversely correlated with the CVs of the physical properties .

@highlight The effects of various pretreatments on multiwalled carbon nanotube MWCNTs dispersed polyamide 66 PA66 nanocomposites PA66 MWCNTs were investigated.
@highlight The non fluffy method NFM was developed based on planetary centrifugal mixing PCM and the dry coating method DCM based on Henschel mixing HM was applied for pretreatment of MWCNTs.
@highlight As pretreatment materials the effects of an epoxy modifier bisphenol F diglycidyl ether DGEBF a fluorosurfactant FSO100 and a silane coupling agent 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane APTES were investigated.
@highlight To quantify the dispersion of MWCNTs in PA66 dispersion ratios were obtained through a Voronoi diagram analysis and their correlation with the mechanical properties and the coefficient of variation CV were investigated.
@highlight The dispersion ratio was inversely correlated with the CV of a physical property which can be an indicator of the process stability.
