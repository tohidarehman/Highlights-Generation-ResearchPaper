 Enhancing matrix crystallization via forming stereocomplex crystallite has been considered as an effect way to improve the impact toughness and heat resistance of poly

@highlight Highly toughened and heat resistant PLLA PCL blends were achieved with assistance of small amount of PDLA.
@highlight The particle size of PCL in low crystalline PLLA blends increased gradually with increasing PDLA content.
@highlight The morphology of the high crystalline matrix blends was controlled by engineering balance between kinetics and thermodynamics of the blends.
