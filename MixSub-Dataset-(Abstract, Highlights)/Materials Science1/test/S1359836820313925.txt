 Polymeric composites with the advantages of easy process light weight and good chemical resistance were employed in thermal management . The construction of a new type thermal conductive filler has become an efficient method for improving the thermal transportation performance of polymer composite . In this work a barnacle like nano crystalline

@highlight A novel barnacle like
@highlight carbide structure was successfully prepared.
@highlight The diamond prepared was demonstrated to be nano crystalline diamond.
@highlight The novel filler improved the thermal conductivity of composite.
