 This paper presents the details and results of a series of follow up experimental and numerical investigations that were conducted to establish the buckling behaviour of special three dimensional fiber metal laminates . This FML is made of a special 3D fiberglass fabric epoxy composite which also hosts a two part liquid urethane foam within its core cavities and further reinforced with basalt and E glass bidirectional fabrics . 3D FML panels with six different configurations were fabricated and beam like specimens were extracted from the panels . The specimens were subjected to uniaxial compression loading . This follow up study focuses on investigating the effects and level of improvement in the performance of the 3D FMLs by utilizing magnesium and stainless steel as the face sheet materials and the enhancement gained by the basalt and E glass fabrics . The responses of the 3D FMLs are also simulated numerically . By comparing the numerical and experimental results it will be explicitly demonstrated that the developed FE framework could serve as an effective and accurate means for establishing the performance of such FMLs including those with more complex geometries and loading conditions . In addition the most effective 3D FMLs are identified and ranked based on their buckling capacity with respect to their cost and weight .

@highlight The effect of different metal types on the buckling capacity and post buckling response of 3D FML is investigated.
@highlight The buckling capacity of stainless steel and magnesium based 3D FMLs are improved by incorporating basalt or glass fabrics.
@highlight Accurate and robust numerical framework for simulating the buckling and post buckling responses of the 3D FMLs is developed.
@highlight Buckling and post buckling responses of six configurations of 3D FMLs are compared.
@highlight The gain in the performances are ranked based on the weight and cost of materials.
