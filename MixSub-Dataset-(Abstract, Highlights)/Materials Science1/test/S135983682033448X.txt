 In this study the impact of natural fibers on the mechanical thermal and hydrodegradation behavior was assessed . Composites based on biobased high density polyethylene were manufactured with a 40wt of wood flour basalt fibers flax fibers and walnut shell flour . The results confirmed the reinforcing effect of NFs on mechanical properties especially in relation to the stiffness of the composites . Significant improvement was visible in the case of composites with basalt fibers with about 600 and 156 improvements for Young s modulus and tensile strength respectively . Moreover to evaluate the viability of NFs as reinforcements water absorption and its influence on mechanical properties were investigated . Unmodified polymer and composites with basalt fibers showed similar relationships low water absorption . Composites reinforced with lignocellulosic fibers exhibited high water uptake and progressive deterioration of properties over time .

@highlight Analysis of bio HDPE composites was conducted.
