 Lowering the operating temperature of solid electrolyte based fuel cells is an attractive approach to achieve highly efficient energy conversion devices for the next generation demands . The present work aims to develop proton conducting electrolyte materials for low temperature fuel cells . In this regard a host matrix of gadolinium doped cerium pyrophosphate has been reinforced by cesium pentahydrogen diphosphate to deliver dense electrolyte material . The composite electrolyte materials were formulated with different compositions and examined for the phase purity sinterability functional group and electrical conductivities . It was found that the reinforcement by CPP assisted formation of a core shell structure which accelerated the proton migration by the acidic dissolution of proton into the shell . This acidic dissolution fastens the kinetics of hydrolysis of the electrolyte resulting in a maximum ionic conductivity of about 9mScm
