 A novel material and process was developed using fibre reinforced powder epoxy to produce unidirectional towpreg with a pilot scale towpregging line for cost effective production of large composite structures for the renewable energy market specifically for wind and tidal turbine blades . Electrostatic attraction was used to coat fibre tows with powder epoxy and either joule or radiant heating employed to heat and melt the polymer followed by consolidation between rollers . Unidirectional carbon fibre and basalt fibre reinforced polymer laminates were manufactured from the towpreg . Tensile test results showed that the towpregging process could be employed to achieve high performance UD CFRP with 0 tensile properties that are similar or better than commercially available UD CFRP systems . The competitive advantages of the powder epoxy towpreg system include lower cost better overall manufacturing control for vacuum bag only manufacturing and the ability to co cure parts together at a later stage . Mechanical test results showed some variation between two types of UD BFRP but the results compared well with published data on UD BFRP and equivalent glass fibre reinforced polymer systems . Finally the influence of hygrothermal ageing due to water immersion on the tensile properties of the materials was investigated with tests revealing that the water ageing effect was more severe in the case of UD BFRP than for UD CFRP .

@highlight The powder epoxy towpregging process was described in detail for both carbon fibres and basalt fibres.
@highlight Excellent static mechanical properties were reported for unidirectional carbon fibre powder epoxy composites and the influence of fibre volume fraction FVF was analysed.
@highlight Two types of basalt fibre were tested showing comparable mechanical properties to glass fibre composites.
@highlight A hygrothermal study of both CFRP and BFRP showed that the latter had a greater sensitivity to water uptake and immersed ageing.
