 Simple self healing behavior of polymers that respond to multiple physicochemical stimuli are highly desirable for industrial applications . In this study under various external environmental stimulating factors we focus on the self healing kinetics of polymer bilayer films comprising a colorless polyimide bottom substrate layer and linseed oil loaded microcapsule embedded polydimethylsiloxane upper healing layer . The experimental results showed clear correlation between stimulating factors and the healing time . Although the crack healing behavior of PBF with 5wt microcapsule under air atmosphere is fairly slow it has an improved healing effect at the artificial crack interface heating to 70C moreover gradual healing is observed by moisture absorption in environments with relative humidity of 70 . Remarkably we found that ultraviolet light irradiation through the 5wt LOMC filled PDMS layer triggers a noticeable kinematic advantage for the drying reaction that initiates interfacial self healing . Short time UV irradiated PBF 5wt exhibits a low water vapor permeability of 35.4gm
