 The premature failure of components due to poor inter particle bonding is the most critical issue in cold spray additive manufacturing . Herein a hybrid strategy combining gas atomization CS and post friction stir processing was proposed to design a nano TiB

@highlight A hybrid CSAM strategy combining composite powder design was used to produce MMC.
@highlight Post FSP was applied to reduce defects and improve TiB
@highlight nanoparticle distribution.
@highlight Simultaneous improvement in tensile strength and ductility was achieved for MMCs.
@highlight The strengthening mechanisms related to interfacial feature were discussed.
