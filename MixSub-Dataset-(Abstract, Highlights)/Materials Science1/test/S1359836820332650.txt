 Ultra High Performance Concrete is a relatively new construction material which has been investigated over the past few decades . Despite its exceptional mechanical strength UHPC still requires passive steel reinforcement to maximise its bending capacity and the overall material cost will be high . The basalt fibre rebar has a higher mechanical strength than steel rebar with lower cost . In addition it also has better alkali resistance and good cost effectiveness . The basalt fibre rebar is therefore considered as a potential alternative reinforcement in the structural member . In this study a recently developed UHPC formula was adopted the conventional steel rebar and basalt fibre rebar were used as reinforcement . The developed components were tested against static flexural and methane air explosion loads . In the four point flexural tests the basalt fibre rebar reinforced specimen performed more ductile structural behaviour with higher flexural strength . Two large scale methane air explosion tests were conducted in buried utility tunnels with different length . The experimental test in shorter tunnel yielded lower explosion pressure with marginal structural response . The test in longer tunnel achieved a higher explosion pressure on concrete elements . The C30 and UHPC specimens with steel basalt fibre rebar reinforcement were tested . The pressure and deflection data revealed that basalt fibre rebar reinforced UHPC component had a more ductile structural behaviour against accidental gas explosion .

@highlight An experimental study of methane gas explosion in two buried tunnels are conducted.
@highlight Two types of reinforcement were applied in UHPC specimen to resist gas explosion.
@highlight Basalt rebar was found to increase the ductility of UHPC in static flexural test.
@highlight Basalt rebar was found to better utilise the performance of UHPC against explosion.
