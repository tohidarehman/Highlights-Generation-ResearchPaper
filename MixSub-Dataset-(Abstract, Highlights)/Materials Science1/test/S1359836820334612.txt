 In many previous studies on humidity sensors based on composites embedded with conductive nanofillers opposite dependence of their electrical resistance on humidity has been reported . In this study we systematically investigate the origin of opposite humidity dependence of the resistance of agarose carbon nanotube composites as a model composite material . Experimental results and impedance analysis reveal that the composites with more conductive fillers present positive dependence of resistance on humidity as an electronic pathway through the well connected fillers is preferred for electrical conduction . In contrast the composites with low filler content show negative dependence as the ionic pathway is more dominant for electrical conduction . The corresponding equivalent circuits for the nanofiller embedded composites are suggested and the expected Nyquist plots depending on the filler content and humidity conditions are discussed . The process based on the impedance analysis potentially allows for non destructive analysis of compositions and electrical property of composites as well as highly sensitive humidity detection .

@highlight Humidity dependent resistance of composites is investigated through experiments and an impedance analysis.
@highlight Composites with high filler content have a positive dependence where electronic conduction is dominant.
@highlight Composites with low filler content have a negative dependence where ionic conduction is dominant.
