 Hydroxyapatite whiskers and magnesium substituted hydroxyapatite whiskers with 1 3 and 5mol magnesium ion substitution contents were successfully prepared by the hydrothermal method . The incorporation of Mg ion into the HAp Ws led to a morphology including a combination of whiskers and particles and a decrease in the crystal interplanar spacing . Then the HAp Ws and Mg HAp Ws were further introduced into a poly

@highlight The HAp whiskers with or without Mg ions were prepared via hydrothermal method.
@highlight The HAp Ws are more conducive to improving the mechanical property of PDLLA matrix.
@highlight The Mg HAp Ws are better for MC3T3 E1 cells adhesion growth and differentiation.
@highlight The osteogenic effect of Mg ions on MC3T3 E1 cells plays in a dose dependent manner.
