 In fluid catalytic cracking unit basic nitrogen species in heavy oil result in the poison of Y zeolite acid sites and the loss of heavy oil conversion . To solve this issue Y ZrO

@highlight Y ZrO
@highlight composites consisting of Y zeolite and ZrO
@highlight were prepared by a two stage crystallization method.
@highlight Y zeolite combined with ZrO
@highlight via ZrOSi bonds in Y ZrO
@highlight composite.
@highlight Y ZrO
@highlight composite shows excellent performance in catalytic cracking high basic nitrogen feedstock.
