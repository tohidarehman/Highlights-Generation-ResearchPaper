 Proteins polysaccharide scaffolds have been attracted extensive attentions in tissue engineering for decades . However degradation of these biocomposites are still unknown owe to their difference in hydrophilicity pore morphology density and crystallinity which obviously limits their applications . Here we designed a silk fibroin hyaluronic acid nerve conduit with oriented channels combining with different components and HA interpenetrating network to improve stability and biodegradation of the conduit . The conduit exhibited well organized porous structure remarkable flexibility water absorption and stability determined by morphology and solubility tests . The structure analysis showed that the silk I structures are dominant of the SF HA conduits . The drug release behavior of the conduits demonstrated gradient release of rhodamine B with an attribute to the oriented channels . Further by HA skeleton of interpenetrating network the SF HA conduits retained conduit and porous morphology in protease XIV solution for 21days . More importantly the conduits showed good biocompatibility which are verified by the growth and phenotype of mouse embryonic stem cell . This study broadening the understanding of the biodegradation behavior of protein polysaccharide biocomposites and provides promising design strategy for nerve conduits .

@highlight Protein polysaccharide conduits with multichannels were fabricated successfully by freezed drying technique.
@highlight Hyaluronic acid acted as skeleton of interpenetrating network against biodegradation of the conduits.
@highlight The conduits exhibited gradient drug release good biocompatibility and potential for nerve tissue engineering.
