 As a permanent power source for self powered electronics piezoelectric energy harvesters which convert waste mechanical energy into electrical energy have attracted considerable interest . We herein developed a high performance PEH by employing a piezoelectric BaTiO

@highlight Piezoelectric composite was fabricated by dispersing the BaTiO
@highlight microclusters inside polymeric matrix.
@highlight ZnSnO
@highlight microspheres based monolayer was fabricated for an embossed pressure concentrator.
@highlight Piezoelectric energy harvester was fabricated by stacking an embossed pressure concentrator onto a piezoelectric composite.
@highlight The fabricated energy harvester generated the high output signals of 206V and 24A.
