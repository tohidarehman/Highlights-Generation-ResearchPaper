 Cesium lead halide perovskites have been subject to intense investigation mostly because of their potential to be used in optoelectronic device applications . However regarding the need for nanoscale materials in forthcoming nanotechnology applications understanding of how the characteristic properties of these perovskite crystals are modified through dimensional crossover is essential . In this study thickness dependence of the structural electronic and vibrational properties of orthorhombic CsPbI

@highlight In this study thickness dependence of characteristic properties of CsPbI3 is investigated using DFT based calculations.
@highlight It is shown that CsI terminated monolayers and bilayers of orthorhombic CsPbI3 are dynamically stable.
@highlight Besides all bulk bilayer and monolayer CsPbI3 structures are direct bandgap semiconductors.
@highlight Finally it was shown that SnS
@highlight encapsulated monolayer CsPbI3 perovskites can be well protected up to 500 K.
