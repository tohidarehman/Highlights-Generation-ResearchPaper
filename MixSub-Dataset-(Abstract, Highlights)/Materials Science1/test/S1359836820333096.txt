 While silver nanoparticles are widely used to endow materials with antibacterial activity silver nanowires have not attracted much attention . Herein the composites of bacterial cellulose and AgNWs were prepared through a novel step by step

@highlight Silver nanowires AgNWs and bacterial cellulose BC were integrated to obtain an advanced wound dressing.
@highlight The BC AgNW dressing exhibited sustained release of silver ions.
@highlight The BC AgNW dressing is robust stretchable antibacterial and biocompatible.
@highlight The BC AgNW dressing showed improved
@highlight skin regeneration over bare BC.
