 In this paper we have conducted a theoretical works on the structural electronic mechanical and optical properties of inorganic lead bromide perovskite APbBr3 for comparison . The calculations have performed using the full potential linearized augmented plane waves method within GGA PBE formalism in ordered to describe the exchange correlation potential . The obtained results showed that the equilibrium parameter values are in good agreement with the available results . For the mechanical properties the obtained values reveal that all APbBr
