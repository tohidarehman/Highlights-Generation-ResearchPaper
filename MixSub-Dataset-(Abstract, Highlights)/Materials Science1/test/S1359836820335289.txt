 The current research presents a first attempt to manufacture thermoplastic tubular composites using carbon fibre as reinforcement and an innovative Elium resin as the matrix material using Bladder Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding manufacturing process . The manufacturing process parameters required to achieve a fully impregnated thermoplastic composites were established and the parts have undergone impact flexure and vibration damping tests . The mechanical properties and the failure modes are compared with the tubes manufactured with conventional epoxy matrix . During impact testing thermoplastic tubular composites have shown 16.3 and 18.9 higher peak load and major damage energy respectively compared to carbon epoxy tubes . They have also shown distinctive failure modes with acrylic Elium composites tubes undergoing more ductile and spreaded failure whilst epoxy composites have shown brittle and catastrophic failure . Flexural tests have shown comparable load carrying capability higher strain to failure and less delamination for carbon Elium composites compared to carbon epoxy composites . These are attributed to the presence of microductlilty and other associated matrix deformation features shown during the fractographic analysis of carbon Elium composites . Vibration modal analysis tests have shown 21.7 higher structural damping for carbon Elium composite measured at different output locations on the tube . The differences in the failure mechanisms and the underlying reasons for the improvement shown by thermoplastic Elium composite tubes under different mechanical tests are deliberated in this paper .
