 Filtration membranes with robust anti fouling performance are highly desirable for practical oily wastewater purification but still a challenge to be realized without water pre wetting procedure . Herein we demonstrate a novel and effective route to address this challenge by decorating MnO

@highlight MnO
@highlight cloth membrane has been fabricated for oil water separation.
@highlight Our membrane exhibit superamphiphilicity in air and surprising underwater superoleophobicity.
@highlight High separation efficiency for various oil water mixtures and emulsions have been realized.
@highlight Robust oil fouling problem can be solved by rinsing the polluted membrane via water.
