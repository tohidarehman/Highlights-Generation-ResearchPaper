 N doped carbon nanosheet and B N co doped carbon nanosheet are first prepared through exfoliation of carbon of Schiff based covalent organic frameworks under ultrasound using sodium lignin sulfonate as the intercalation agent and modifier . Then poly BNC nanocomposite with enhanced thermal oxidation stability good mechanical performances and enhanced flame retardancy has been prepared through solution blending . The temperature at 5wt weight loss and peak heat release rate of PVA loaded with 4wt of BNC nanosheet increase by 31.9C and 57.3 compared with that of untreated PVA respectively . A new fire hazard evaluation system based on analytic hierarchy process is raised to comprehensively estimate fire risk of prepared sample . It is deduced from AHP that PVA loaded with 4wt BNC nanosheet shows the lowest fire risk . The effect of BNC nanosheet on pyrolysis mode of PVA in gaseous and condensed phase has also been investigated to figure out the reason for low fire risk of treated PVA .
