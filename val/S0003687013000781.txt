 Proposed here is an evaluation of multiple muscle loads and a procedure for determining optimum solutions to ergonomic design problems. The simultaneous muscle load evaluation is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and optimum solutions are obtained for each participant. In addition, one optimum solution for all participants, which is defined as the compromise solution, is also obtained. Moreover, the proposed method provides both objective and subjective information to support the decision making of designers. The proposed method was applied to the problem of designing the handrail position for the sit-to-stand movement. The height and distance of the handrails were the design variables, and surface electromyograms of four muscles were measured. The optimization results suggest that the proposed evaluation represents the impressions of participants more completely than an independent use of muscle loads. In addition, the compromise solution is determined, and the benefits of the proposed method are examined.

@highlight We proposed a simultaneous evaluation method for multiple muscle loads by applying the optimization methodology.
@highlight A satisfaction level function was derived to reveal the relationship between the muscle load and the subjective evaluation.
@highlight The proposed method was applied to the design problem of handrail position for standing.
@highlight The proposed method can provide both objective and subjective information, and the method may be a great help to designers.
