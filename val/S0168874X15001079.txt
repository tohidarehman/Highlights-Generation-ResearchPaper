 An effective Eulerian approach employing Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curves as a boundary representing technique is presented. This approach is based on the Spline-Based Meshfree Method: analysis domain boundaries are represented by NURBS curves and a NURBS patch is employed as a background mesh. By doing so, clear and neat boundary representations are possible. Moreover, the explicit definition of the analysis domain boundary dispenses with the need to solve convective transport equations. In this work, utilizing the above idea, bulk metal forming processes are treated within Eulerian framework based on the flow formulation of rigid-plastic materials. The implementation issues of the proposed method are discussed in detail. The effectiveness of the present approach is shown by comparing with other numerical methods. It is demonstrated that the method yields reliable results even in the case where severe deformation occurs.
