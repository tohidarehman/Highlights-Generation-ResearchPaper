 A balance between portability and usability made the 10.1″ diagonal screens popular in the Mobile PC market (e.g., 10.1″ mini-notebooks/netbooks, convertible/hybrid ultraportables); yet no academic research rationalizes this phenomenon. This study investigated the size effects of display and input devices of 4 mini-notebooks (netbooks) ranged in size on their performances in 2 simple and 3 complex applied tasks. It seemed that the closer the display and/or input devices (touchpad/touchscreen/keyboard) sizes to those sizes of a generic notebook, the shorter the operation times (there was no certain phenomenon for the error rates). With non-significant differences, the 10.1″ and 8.9″ mini-notebooks (netbooks) were as fast as the 11.6″ one in almost all the tasks, except for the 8.9″ one in the typing tasks. The 11.6″ mini-notebook (netbook) was most preferred; while the difference in the satisfactions was not significant between the 10.1″ and 11.6″ ones but between the 7″ and 11.6″ ones.

@highlight The closer the device sizes to the regular sizes, the shorter the operation times.
@highlight Both the effects of screen and input-device sizes affected movement times.
@highlight The 11.6″ and 7″ diagonal screens were most and least preferred, respectively.
@highlight All performances of the 10.1″ model rationalized its domination in the market.
@highlight The 8.9″ model was good in portability and task performances (except for typing).
