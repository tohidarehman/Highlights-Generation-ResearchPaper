 This paper presents an effective numerical approach for welding process parameter optimization to minimize weld-induced distortion in structures. A numerical optimization framework based on coupled Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is developed and implemented for a low and a high fidelity model. Classical weakly coupled thermo-mechanical analysis with thermo-elasto-plastic assumptions is carried out for distortion prediction of numerical models. The search for optimum process parameters is executed by direct integration of numerical models and GA-based optimization technique. The developed framework automatically inserts the process parameters into the simulation models, executes the FE-based welding simulations and evaluates the required simulation output data for iterative evolutionary optimization. The optimization results show that the proposed approach can contribute substantially to enhance final welded product quality while facilitating and accelerating the product design and development.
