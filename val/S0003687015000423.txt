 Prolonged sedentary computer use is a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain. The aim of this study was to explore postural dynamism during two common computer tasks, namely mouse use and keyboard typing. Postural dynamism was described as the total number of postural changes that occurred during the data capture period. Twelve participants were recruited to perform a mouse and a typing task. The data of only eight participants could be analysed. A 3D motion analysis system measured the number of cervical and thoracic postural changes as well as, the range in which the postural changes occurred. The study findings illustrate that there is less postural dynamism of the cervical and thoracic spinal regions during computer mouse use, when compared to keyboard typing.

@highlight Postural dynamism related to keyboard and mouse use is explored.
@highlight Postural dynamism and spinal positions in three dimensions are used as parameters.
@highlight Mouse use is associated with a generally fixated spinal posture.
@highlight Keyboard use demonstrates a more dynamic spine than mouse use.
