 This paper proposes a multi-channel ZigBee wireless sensor network (WSN) for robust data transmission. This study sought to increase the packet delivery ratio (PDR) through the application of multi-channel technology. Based on a cluster-tree construction protocol, we implemented a multi-channel time division multiple-access scheme using hardware devices. Furthermore, ZigBee and wireless LAN (WLAN) both operate on the 2.4 GHz band, referred to as the industrial, scientific, and medical unlicensed band. As a result, ZigBee faces severe interference problems in the presence of WLAN. In this study, we developed an interference avoidance method to improve conditions for the coexistence of ZigBee and WLAN and then conducted experiments using a practical network implementation to evaluate the resulting performance. Our experiment results demonstrate considerable improvements in the PDR of ZigBee transmission in an environment with interference from WLAN. Image, graphical abstract
