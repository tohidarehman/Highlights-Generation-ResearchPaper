 Diets laden with salt and refined sugar have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and hypertension. However, few studies have investigated the impact of such diets on reproductive functions, hence, the present study. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (100–120 g, n = 24) were randomly divided into four groups designated control (standard chow), sucrose (30% w/v as drinking water), salt (8% salt diet) and sucrose + salt (30% w/v as drinking water + 8% salt diet). After 6 weeks, rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Sperm function was assessed post mortem. Blood sample was drawn via the retro-orbital sinus for estimation of serum levels of corticosterone, testosterone, LH and FSH using ELISA kit and electrolytes using flame photometer. Oxidative analyses of testes homogenate were carried out using previously described methods. Values are means ± SEM, compared by ANOVA. Sperm concentration, motility, viability and morphology were significantly altered in sucrose, salt, and sucrose + salt fed rats. In addition, the serum level of testosterone was significantly reduced in the treated rats compared with control. Sucrose, salt and sucrose + salt feeding resulted in increased level of serum corticosterone when compared with control. MDA level was significantly increased in salt and sucrose + salt fed rats compared with control and sucrose fed rats. Meanwhile, the activity of SOD was significantly increased in the treated rats compared with control. These data indicate that consumption of high sucrose and high salt diet either together or in isolation impact negatively on sperm function and may be underpinning the increasing prevalence of male infertility.

@highlight Altered sperm function is markedly evident in rats fed with high sucrose and/or high salt diet.
@highlight High sucrose and salt modulates corticosterone and testosterone secretion.
@highlight Testicular lipid peroxidation is associated with high sucrose and/or high salt diet consumption.
