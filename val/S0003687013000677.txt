 Body armour is used widely by law enforcement and other agencies but has received mixed reviews. This study examined the influence of stab resistant body armour (SRBA) and mandated accessories on physiological responses to, and the performance of, simulated mobility tasks. Fifty-two males (37 ± 9.2 yr, 180.7 ± 6.1 cm, 90.2 ± 11.6 kg, VO2max 50 ± 8.5 ml kg−1 min−1, BMI 27.6 ± 3.1, mean ± SD) completed a running VO2max test and task familiarisation. Two experimental sessions were completed (≥4 days in between) in a randomised counterbalanced order, one while wearing SRBA and appointments (loaded) and one without additional load (unloaded). During each session participants performed five mobility tasks: a balance task, an acceleration task that simulated exiting a vehicle, chin-ups, a grappling task, and a manoeuvrability task. A 5-min treadmill run (zero-incline at 13 km·h−1, running start) was then completed. One min after the run the five mobility tasks were repeated. There was a significant decrease in performance during all tasks with loading (p < 0.001). Participants were off-balance longer; slower to complete the acceleration, grapple and mobility tasks; completed fewer chin-ups; and had greater physiological cost (↑ %HRmax, ↑ %VO2max, ↑ RER) and perceptual effort (↑ RPE) during the 5-min run. Mean performance decreases ranged from 13 to 42% while loaded, with further decreases of 6–16% noted after the 5-min run. Unloaded task performance was no different between phases. Wearing SRBA and appointments significantly reduced mobility during key task elements and resulted in greater physiological effort. These findings could have consequences for optimal function in the working environment and therefore officer and public safety.
