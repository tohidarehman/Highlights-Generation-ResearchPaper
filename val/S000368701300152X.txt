 The aim of the present study was to assess the activity levels of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and upper trapezius muscle during static postures under controlled and standardized conditions, and to determine whether the muscle activity differed between sexes. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded unilaterally from the sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscle in 17 participants whilst they were performing various postural tasks. EMG amplitude was measured by the root mean square values of the raw signals and normalized to peak maximum contractile values for each muscle (%MVC). The intensity of muscle activity was ranked as light (<3%MVC), moderate (3%MVC ≤ EMG ≤ 8%MVC), and substantial (>8%MVC). During most tasks the two muscles contracted light to moderately. Head leaning and shoulder shrugging postures yielded substantial muscle activity in both muscles. Muscle activity did not differ significantly between male and female participants (F = 3.1; p = 0.078). Our findings provided normative values, which will enhance future studies of muscle activity during work in a natural, unrestrained environment.

@highlight A broad range of work-related postural tasks was standardized using a computer guided task paradigm.
@highlight The sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscles were mildly active during the majority of postures investigated.
@highlight Certain head and neck tasks activated the sternocleidomastoid, whilst shoulder and arm tasks activated the upper trapezius.
@highlight The muscle activity did not differ significantly between male and female participants.
@highlight This study provides reference values for further investigation of these muscles in the natural work environment.
