 Helicopter aircrew members engage in highly demanding cognitive tasks in an environment subject to whole-body vibration (WBV). Sometimes their actions may not be according to plan (e.g. action slips and lapses). This study used a Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) to examine whether action slips were more frequent during exposure to WBV. Nineteen participants performed the SART in two blocks. In the WBV block participants were exposed to 17 Hz vertical WBV, which is typical of larger helicopter working environments. In the No-WBV block there was no WBV. There were more responses to the rare no-go digit 3 (i.e. action slips) in the WBV block, and participants responded faster in the WBV block. These results suggest that WBV influences response inhibition, and can induce impulsive responding. WBV may increase the likelihood of action slips, mainly due to failure of response inhibition.

@highlight We examine whether whole-body vibration (WBV) increases frequency of action slips.
@highlight There were more errors of commission (i.e. action slips) during 17 Hz vertical WBV.
@highlight Responses to stimuli were faster during 17 Hz vertical WBV.
@highlight 17 Hz vertical WBV can induce impulsive responding.
@highlight The number of action slips may increase because responses are faster during WBV.
