 Many paramedics' work accidents are related to physical aspects of the job, and the most affected body part is the low back. This study documents the trunk motion exposure of paramedics on the job. Nine paramedics were observed over 12 shifts (120h). Trunk postures were recorded with the computer-assisted CUELA measurement system worn on the back like a knapsack. Average duration of an emergency call was 23.5min. Sagittal trunk flexion of >40° and twisting rotation of >24° were observed in 21% and 17% of time-sampled postures. Medical care on the scene (44% of total time) involved prolonged flexed and twisted postures (∼10s). The highest extreme sagittal trunk flexion (63°) and twisting rotation (40°) were observed during lifting activities, which lasted 2% of the total time. Paramedics adopted trunk motions that may significantly increase the risk of low back disorders during medical care and patient-handling activities.

@highlight Postural load of paramedics on the job was examined using direct field measurements.
@highlight The highest trunk angles in the three planes were observed during lifting activities.
@highlight Peak velocities of the trunk were observed during ambulance transport.
@highlight Increased trunk motion exposure was observed in urgent and high-demand situations.
@highlight Paramedics adopted trunk motions that may increase the risk of low back disorders.
