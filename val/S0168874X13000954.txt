 A new finite element model for steel–concrete side-plated beams exposed to mechanical and thermal loading is presented. The moisture and heat transfer through concrete is considered independent on mechanical deformations. The hygro-thermo-mechanical analysis is performed in two separate steps starting with the moisture and heat transfer analysis and continuing with the mechanical stress–strain analysis. The finite-element model of Davie, Pearce, and Bićanić was implemented for the moisture and heat transfer analysis in the concrete part of the beam. The Fourier equation of heat transfer for non-porous solids was applied in the steel part. A novel, strain-based finite-element formulation of the planar beam is proposed to perform the mechanical part of the fire analysis. Each of the two steps of the model is first verified by comparing the present numerical results with the experimental and numerical data available in the literature. The finite-element formulations of both the hygro-thermal and the mechanical steps of the analysis are found to be reliable and accurate. Finally, effects of the side reinforcing of a RC beam as one of the methods of structural retrofitting are explored in the case of a typical fire scenario and an important contribution of the side-plates to the ultimate fire resistance of the beam is discovered, particularly when higher levels of the service load are applied to the beam. mass of phase i per unit volume of gaseous material ( volume fraction of phase i ( FW material density ( FW mass flux of phase FW rate of evaporation (including desorption) time heat capacity of concrete thermal conductivity of concrete energy transferred by the fluid flow specific heat of evaporation specific heat of dehydration mass of bound water released by the dehydration per unit volume of concrete absolute temperature degree of saturation with free water porosity of concrete degree of saturation with adsorbed water solid saturation point diffusion coefficient of dry air in water vapour diffusion coefficient of water vapour in dry air velocity in phase i ( coefficient of the adsorbed water diffusion intrinsic permeability of dry concrete relative permeability of phase i ( dynamic viscosity of phase i ( partial pressure in phase i ( capillary pressure pore pressure length of the beam component ( the orthonormal base vectors of a fixed spatial right-handed Cartesian coordinate system the orthonormal base vectors of a material right-handed Cartesian coordinate system of layer the X-displacement of the particle on the reference axis of layer i ( the Z-displacement of the particle on the reference axis of layer i ( the rotation of the reference axis of layer i ( the extensional strain of the reference axis of layer i ( the bending strain of the reference axis of layer i ( ) (the curvature) the X and Z components of the cross-sectional stress resultant of layer i, the cross-sectional axial and shear force of layer i ( the bending moment of layer i ( extensional mechanical strain in a generic particle of layer i ( stress in a generic particle of layer i ( X, Y, and Z components of the traction vectors per unit length of the reference axis of layer i ( traction vectors per unit length of the reference axis of layer i ( surface and volume forces of layer i ( contour of the cross-section of layer i ( ) and its differential area of the cross-section of layer i ( ) and its differential cross-sectional position vector of a specific particle of layer i with respect to the reference axis ( the position vector of the observed particle of layer i ( the slip vector between two initially coincident particles: one belonging to the beam and the other to the side plate the X (the longitudinal) component of the slip vector the Z (the transverse) component of the slip vector contact traction vector total (i.e. geometrical) strain in a generic particle of layer i ( free thermal strain in a generic particle of layer i ( stress induced creep strain in a generic particle of layer i ( stress induced transient strain in a generic particle of concrete external boundary forces of beam i ( Lagrangian interpolation polynomials of the order emissivity coefficient over the heated surface ( convection coefficient over the heated surface ( mass of cement per unit volume of concrete modulus of elasticity of material ( 20 tangent modulus of steel hardening ( 20 yield stress of steel and corresponding mechanical strain ( 20 steel strain at the peak stress ( 20 ultimate steel strain ( 20 absolute mean value of cylinder compressive strength of concrete at age 28 days ( 20 ) and the related strain ultimate concrete compressive strain ( 20 ultimate steel strain ( 20 tensile strength of concrete ( 20 concrete strain at 0.55 ct 20 and at ambient temperature ultimate concrete tensile strain at ambient temperature initial concrete permeability in the top surface of concrete cross-section depth of concrete cross-section distance from the top fibre of concrete cross-section depth of the neutral axis of concrete cross-section under service loads number of segments of cross-sectional area of layer i in j direction ( number of Gaussian integration nodes in j direction for each segment of cross-sectional area of layer i ( number of Gaussian integration nodes along the side plate-RC beam contact atmospheric conditions initial conditions free (liquid and adsorbed) water phase liquid water phase adsorbed water phase gas phase water vapour phase dry air phase concrete steel (rebar or side plates) pore pressure contribution in the total stress of concrete effective stress contribution in the total stress of concrete external contribution in the traction vector components contact contribution in the traction vector components ambient temperature conditions conditions at elevated temperature horizontal direction vertical direction Gaussian integration node RC beam side plates
