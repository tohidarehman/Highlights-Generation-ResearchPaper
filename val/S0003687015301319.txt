 Sub-Saharan African women on small-acreage farms carry a disproportionately higher labor burden, which is one of the main reasons they are unable to produce for both home and the market and realize higher incomes. Labor-saving interventions such as hand-tools are needed to save time and/or increase productivity in, for example, land preparation for crop and animal agriculture, post-harvest processing, and meeting daily energy and water needs. Development of such tools requires comprehensive and content-specific anthropometric data or body dimensions and existing databases based on Western women may be less relevant. We conducted measurements on 89 women to provide preliminary results toward answering two questions. First, how well existing databases are applicable in the design of hand-tools for sub-Saharan African women. Second, how universal body dimension predictive models are among ethnic groups. Our results show that, body dimensions between Bantu and Nilotic ethnolinguistic groups are different and both are different from American women. These results strongly support the need for establishing anthropometric databases for sub-Saharan African women, toward hand-tool design.The plot below reveals general body dimensions’ differences among Ugandan women of Bantu (Kiboga, Mbarara and Ngoma locations) and Nilotic (Kotido location) ethnolinguistic groups. Principle components (PC1 and PC2) were obtained from analysis of 28 anthropometric measurements from a total of 89 women. The co-clustering of Ngoma and Mbarara women suggest they are identical while the “spread out” along PC2 of the Kiboga women is intriguing and suggests more women should be measured to be able to gain better understanding of the difference there might be between Kiboga women and their other two Bantu “sisters”.

@highlight Development of hand-tools to reduce labor burden requires rich anthropometric data.
@highlight Western anthropometric databases do not adequately represent sub-Saharan women.
@highlight Results from measuring 89 women show differences among different groups.
@highlight More measurements are needed for more conclusive results and predictive models.
