 One of the aims of statistical tolerance analysis is to evaluate a predicted quality level at the design stage. One method consists of computing the defect probability expressed in parts per million (ppm). It represents the probability that a functional requirement will not be satisfied in mass production. This paper focuses on the statistical tolerance analysis of over-constrained mechanisms containing gaps. In this case, the values of the functional characteristics depend on the gap situations and are not explicitly formulated with respect to part deviations. To compute , an innovative methodology using system reliability methods is presented. This new approach is compared with an existing one based on an optimization algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations. The whole approach is illustrated using two industrial mechanisms: one inspired by a producer of coaxial connectors and one prismatic pair. Its major advantage is to considerably reduce computation time. Defect probability of the mechanism Assembly defect probability of the mechanism Functionality defect probability of the mechanism -dimensional multivariate normal cumulative distribution function Vector of part deviations -th part deviation Vector of part positions -th part position -th assembly constraint Number of assembly constraints -th non-interference constraint Number of non-interference constraints Non-interference domain Linearized function Number of contact point situations coordinates relative to the -th contact point situation Performance function associated with the -th contact point situation Number of dominant contact point situations

@highlight Gaps cannot be considered as random variables.
@highlight The tolerance analysis issue is formulated thanks to the quantifier notion.
@highlight Two defect probabilities are defined: functionality defect probability and assembly defect probability.
@highlight Defect probabilities are computed using a system reliability method: FORM system.
