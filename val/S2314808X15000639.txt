 The purpose of this paper is to introduce and study a new class of fuzzy sets called (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets and (r, s)-generalized â‹†-fuzzy b-closed sets in double fuzzy topological spaces. Furthermore, the relationships between the new concepts are introduced and established with some interesting examples.

@highlight The paper related to the pure mathematics, in double fuzzy topological spaces which is a generalization to the concept of fuzzy topological spaces. We corrected all referee's comments in the revised version.
