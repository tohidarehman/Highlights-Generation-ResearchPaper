 White-on-blue logo signs on the sides of highways are typically used to notify drivers of food, gas, and lodging at an upcoming interchange. The current research assessed driver performance and attention allocation in a simulated freeway driving task when exposed to six-panel logo signs, nine-panel logo signs, mileage guide signs, and roadway work zones both with and without an in-car navigation device. The objective was to identify the impact of signage types on driver behavior under realistic driving conditions. Results revealed glance durations and fixation frequencies to guide signs to be significantly lower than with six-panel and nine-panel logo signs, but no differences were found between six-panel and nine-panel logo signs. There were also statistical differences among the independent variables for speed deviation and lane deviation, but magnitudes were not large enough to be considered practically significant in terms of driving safety. Overall, there were minor differences in sign processing time between logo signs and mileage guide signs, but such differences did not translate to degradations in vehicle control.

@highlight Visual processing times for logo signs are slightly higher than for guide signs.
@highlight Increased visual processing times for logo signs do not result in any vehicle control degradation.
@highlight There are no attention allocation or driving performance differences between the use of six- and nine-panel logo signs.
@highlight Drivers exhibit high levels of lane and speed control in navigating a work zone as compared to driving on an open freeway.
@highlight Driving performance did not degrade during driver use of an in-car navigation aid.
