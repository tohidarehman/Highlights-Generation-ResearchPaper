 This study of selected jobs in the health care sector explored a range of physical and psychosocial factors to identify those that most strongly predicted work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) risk. A self-report survey was used to collect data on physical and psychosocial risk factors from employees in three health care organisations in Victoria, Australia. Multivariate analyses demonstrated the importance of both psychosocial and physical hazards in predicting WMSD risk and provides evidence for risk management of WMSDs to incorporate a more comprehensive and integrated approach. Use of a risk management toolkit is recommended to address WMSD risk in the workplace.

@highlight High prevalence of discomfort levels are evident in the health care sector.
@highlight WMSD risk in the health care is predicted by physical and psychosocial hazards.
@highlight Risk management of WMSDs must address physical and psychosocial hazards.
@highlight A toolkit approach is proposed to improve risk management of WMSDs in health care.
