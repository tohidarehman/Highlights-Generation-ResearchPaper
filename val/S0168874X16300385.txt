 This paper presents a new two-scale damage model of the fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)–concrete bond under high-cycle fatigue. The material behavior is modeled as elastic-plastic coupled with damage for the microscale analysis and as elastic for the mesoscale analysis. A new damage law for the interface joint is described. The two-scale damage model has been implemented as a material model for a three dimensional an eight-node interface element of zero thickness and used to simulate a double shear joint specimen under high cycle fatigue. The numerical calculations were performed with a full incremental cycle solution and a new cycle jump approach.
