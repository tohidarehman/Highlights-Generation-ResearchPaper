 This field study examined associations between workplace stressors and office workers' computer use patterns. We collected keyboard and mouse activities of 93 office workers (68F, 25M) for approximately two work weeks. Linear regression analyses examined the associations between self-reported effort, reward, overcommitment, and perceived stress and software-recorded computer use duration, number of short and long computer breaks, and pace of input device usage. Daily duration of computer use was, on average, 30 min longer for workers with high compared to low levels of overcommitment and perceived stress. The number of short computer breaks (30 s–5 min long) was approximately 20% lower for those with high compared to low effort and for those with low compared to high reward. These outcomes support the hypothesis that office workers' computer use patterns vary across individuals with different levels of workplace stressors.

@highlight Daily computer use duration was, on average, 30 minutes longer for workers with high overcommitment and perceived stress.
@highlight The number of short computer breaks was about 20% lower for workers with high effort and for workers with low reward.
@highlight Workers with high compared to low effort had, after adjusting for age, a significantly shorter key strike duration.
@highlight No effects of overcommitment, reward, and perceived stress on the pace of input device usage were found.
