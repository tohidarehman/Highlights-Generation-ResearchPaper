 The leaves of Chenopodium album Linn. are traditionally used for treatment of kidney diseases and urinary stones. The present work investigated the effect of aqueous extract of leaves of C. album (CAAE) on in-vitro crystallization of CaOx and brushite crystals. Crystallization was studied by using nucleation and aggregation assay of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals and growth assay of calcium oxalate monohydrate and brushite crystals. The effects of CAAE and cystone on slope of nucleation and aggregation as well as growth of calcium oxalate crystallization were evaluated spectrophotometrically. The densities of the formed crystals were compared under microscope. The effects of CAAE and citric acid on growth of brushite crystals were studied by using single diffusion gel growth technique, and the parameters evaluated were length, morphology and average size of the deposited crystals. CAAE significantly inhibited the slope of nucleation and aggregation of CaOx crystallization, and decreased the crystal density. It also inhibited the growth and caused the dissolution of brushite crystals. The standard drug cystone or citric acid also exhibited similar effects. The study reveals that the leaves of C. album were found effective in the prevention of the experimentally induced urinary stones and substantiate the traditional claim. It is concluded that the leaves of C. album have beneficial inhibitory effect on in-vitro crystallization of CaOx and CHPD (brushite) crystals.

@highlight Study of Chenopodium album leaf aqueous extract on in vitro crystallization processes.
@highlight Nucleation and aggregation were studied in calcium oxalate crystals and growth assay in brushite crystals.
@highlight The extracts and cystone showed inhibition of nucleation, aggregation and growth of crystals.
@highlight Anti-urolithiatic effects of the extract might be due to the presence phytochemicals like flavonoids and saponins.
