 This paper reports on novel ventilation design in sports T-shirt, which combines spacer and mesh structure, and experimental evidence on the advantages of design in improving thermal comfort. Evaporative resistance (R e) and thermal insulation (R c) of T-shirts were measured using a sweating thermal manikin under three different air velocities. Moisture permeability index (i m) was calculated to compare the different designed T-shirts. The T-shirts of new and conventional designs were also compared by wearer trials, which were comprised of 30 min treadmill running followed by 10 min rest. Skin temperature, skin relative humidity, heart rate, oxygen inhalation and energy expenditure were monitored, and subjective sensations were asked. Results demonstrated that novel T-shirt has 11.1% significant lower i m than control sample under windy condition. The novel T-shirt contributes to reduce the variation of skin temperature and relative humidity up to 37% and 32%, as well as decrease 3.3% energy consumption during exercise.

@highlight Spacer and mesh structures were combined to increase ventilation of sports T-shirt.
@highlight Effects of the ventilation design are examined by thermal manikin and wearer trials.
