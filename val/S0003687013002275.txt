 Introduction Floor layers have high rates of musculoskeletal disorders yet few studies have examined their work exposures. This study used observational methods to describe physical exposures within floor laying tasks. Methods We analyzed 45 videos from 32 floor layers using Multimedia-Video Task Analysis software to determine the time in task, forces, postures, and repetitive hand movements for installation of four common flooring materials. We used the WISHA checklists to define exposure thresholds. Results Most workers (91%) met the caution threshold for one or more exposures. Workers showed high exposures in multiple body parts with variability in exposures across tasks and for different materials. Prolonged exposures were seen for kneeling, poor neck and low back postures, and intermittent but frequent hand grip forces. Conclusions Floor layers experience prolonged awkward postures and high force physical exposures in multiple body parts, which probably contribute to their high rates of musculoskeletal disorders.

@highlight Most (91%) floor layers met caution risk levels of physical exposures daily.
@highlight Prolonged awkward postures and high force exposures occurred in multiple body parts.
@highlight Besides kneeling, poor neck and low back postures are common in floor layers.
@highlight Upper extremity exposures occur from 10 to 30% of the work day.
@highlight Hand, wrist, and shoulder exposure levels differ by the type of material installed.
