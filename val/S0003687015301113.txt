 Fourteen healthy male subjects slept from 13:30 to 15:30 under ambient temperature and relative humidity maintained at 15 °C and 60%, respectively. They slept under two conditions: in a sleeping bag on wooden flooring (Wood) and in a sleeping bag with corrugated cardboard between the bag and the flooring (CC). Polysomnography, skin temperature (Tsk), microclimate, bed climate, and subjective sensations were obtained. The number of awakenings in the CC had significantly decreased compared to that in the Wood. The mean, back, and thigh Tsk, and bed climate temperature were significantly higher in the CC than that in the Wood. Subjective thermal sensations were warmer in the CC than in the Wood. These results suggest that using corrugated cardboard under a sleeping bag may reduce cold stress, thereby decreasing the number of awakenings and increasing subjective warmth; the mean, back, and thigh Tsk; and bed climate temperature.

@highlight We compared usage of sleeping bags on corrugated cardboard or flooring during naps.
@highlight Using corrugated cardboard decreased the number of awakenings.
@highlight Skin temperature and subjective warmth increased in the corrugated cardboard group.
@highlight Increasing the thermal insulation under the body reduces cold stress.
@highlight Results can be used for practical application in future disaster circumstances.
