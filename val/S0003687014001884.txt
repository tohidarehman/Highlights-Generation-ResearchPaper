 High quality flat panel computer displays (FPDs) with high resolution screens are now commonplace, and black, grey, white, beige and silver surrounds (‘bezels’), matt or glossy, are in widespread use. It has been suggested that bezels with high reflectance, or with a high gloss, could cause eyestrain, and we have investigated this issue. Twenty office workers (unaware of the study purpose) used six different FPDs, for a week each, at their own desk. These displays were identical apart from the bezel colour (black, white or silver) and shininess (matt or glossy). Participants completed questionnaires about their visual comfort at the end of each week, and were fully debriefed in lunch-time focus groups at the end of the study. For the white and the silver bezels, the glossiness of the bezel was not an issue of concern. The participants were significantly less content with the glossy black surround than with the matt black surround, and in general the glossy black bezel was the least-liked of all those used. With the possible exception of this surround, there was no evidence of significantly increased visual discomfort, indicative of eyestrain, as a result of high or low bezel reflectance, or of high glossiness.

@highlight It has been suggested that glossy screen surrounds (bezels) could cause eyestrain, or adverse symptoms to users.
@highlight We studied the responses of twenty naive office workers who each used six different bezels, which were changed weekly.
@highlight None of the participants were disturbed by the glossiness of the bezels.
@highlight Although preferences were found, there was no relationship between glossiness and adverse symptom.
@highlight We conclude that there are no sound reasons for restricting bezel glossiness.
