 This study examined whether the provision of feedback and the interval between successive stimuli interact to affect performance on a serial simple reaction time test during sleep deprivation. Sixteen participants (9 female, 7 male, aged 18–27 yr) completed four versions of the 5-min psychomotor vigilance task for a handheld personal digital assistant (PalmPVT) every 2 h during 28 h of sustained wakefulness. The four versions differed in terms of whether or not they provided feedback immediately after each response, and whether the inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) were long (2–10 s) or short (1–5 s). Cognitive function was assessed using reciprocal response time and percentage of responses that were lapses (i.e., had a response time ≥ 500 ms). Data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA with three within-subjects factors: test session, feedback, and ISI. For both measures, the only significant interaction was between feedback and ISI. Cognitive function was enhanced by feedback when the ISIs were long because it provided motivation. Cognitive function was not affected by feedback when the ISIs were short because there was insufficient time to both attend to the feedback and prepare for the subsequent stimulus.

@highlight We examined performance on the psychomotor vigilance task—a serial simple reaction time test—during 28 h of sustained wake.
@highlight The provision of feedback and the length of the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) interacted to affect performance.
@highlight Feedback after each response resulted in better performance when the ISI ranged from 2–10 s.
@highlight Feedback after each response did not affect performance when the ISI ranged from 1–5 s.
@highlight When the ISI is long, it is possible that feedback provides motivation.
@highlight When the ISI is short, it is likely that there is not time to both attend to feedback and prepare for the next stimulus.
