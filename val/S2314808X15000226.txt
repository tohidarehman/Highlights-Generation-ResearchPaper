 An incompressible Oldroydian viscoelastic fluid layer heated and soluted from below in the presence of suspended (dust) particles and uniform vertical magnetic field to include the effect of Hall currents in porous medium is considered. Following the linearized stability theory and normal mode analysis, the dispersion relation is obtained. For the case of stationary convection, Oldroydian viscoelastic fluid behaves like an ordinary Newtonian fluid. Dust particles and Hall currents are found to have a destabilizing effect on the thermosolutal convection, whereas magnetic field is found to have a stabilizing effect on the thermosolutal convection. Medium permeability has both stabilizing and destabilizing effect on the thermosolutal convection under certain conditions. Graphs have been plotted by giving numerical values to the parameters to depict the stability characteristics. The case of overstability is also considered. dimensionless wave number speed of light depth of layer derivative with respect to e Charge of an electron relaxation time retardation time acceleration due to gravity field uniform magnetic field having components 0,0 perturbation in magnetic field having components horizontal wave numbers wave number thermal diffusivity Solute diffusivity Hall current parameter electron number density growth rate fluid pressure Prandtl number magnetic Prandtl number velocity of fluid perturbations in fluid velocity Chandrasekhar number Rayleigh number Time coordinate temperature concentration space coordinates electrical resistivity coefficient of thermal expansion uniform temperature gradient perturbation in temperature, perturbation in concentration, perturbation in pressure fluid density perturbation in density magnetic permeability del operator curly operator
