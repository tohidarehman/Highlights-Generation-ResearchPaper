 This study investigated delivery scenarios of service drivers working in the retail meat industry. The methodology included analysis of accident reports, and field investigations of deliveries at craft-butcher shop premises, including semi-structured interviews with managers and workers. The findings provide greater clarity about the hazards in this job, and suggest for peripatetic delivery activities, four main factors on which decisions about risk and good practice may be made: composition of the orders; characteristics of the delivery vehicle/truck; handling method most often used; and, the road/access conditions.

@highlight We gathered information about work techniques, and good practices, to characterise the handling practices.
@highlight We gathered information about driver injury to determine underlying causes, and proneness to incidents.
@highlight A number of factors that can increase the risk of injury are identified along with measures to mitigate them.
@highlight An approach for risk assessment is suggested which could be applied in similar peripatetic delivery work situations.
