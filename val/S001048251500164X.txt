 Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop an inverse dynamic model of the human middle finger in order to identify the muscle activation, muscle force, and neural activation of the muscles involved during motion. Its originality comes from the coupling of biomechanical and physiological models and the proposition of a dedicated optimization procedure and cost function for identifying the model unknowns. Methods Three sub-models work in interaction: the first is the biomechanical model, primarily consisting of the dynamic equations of the middle finger system; the second is the muscle model, which helps to identify the muscle force from muscle activation and dynamic deformation for six involved muscles. The third model allows one to link muscle activation to neural intent from the Central Nervous System (CNS). This modeling procedure leads to a complex analytical nonlinear system identified using multi-step energy minimization procedure and a specific cost function. Results Numerical simulations with different articulation velocities are presented and discussed. Then, experimental evaluation of the proposed model is performed following a protocol combining electromyography and motion capture during a hand openingâ€“closing paradigm. After comparison, several results from the simulation and experiments were found to be in accordance. The difficulty in evaluating such complex dynamic models is also demonstrated. Conclusions Despite the model simplifications, the obtained preliminary results are promising. Indeed, the proposed model, once correctly validated in future works, should be a relevant tool to simulate and predict deficiencies of the middle finger system for rehabilitation purposes. and are the flexion angles of DIP joint, PIP joint; and MCP joint respectively () represents the angular velocities represents the angular accelerations and are the external moment applied on the system constituted by the phalanx P4; P4 and P3; and P4, P3 and P2 respectively (). muscle activation of muscle i. neural activation of muscle i muscle deformation of muscle i. muscle deformation velocity of muscle i. muscle force of muscle i. post-processed EMG. distal interphalangeal joint. proximal interphalangeal joint. metacarpophalangeal joint. flexor digitorum superficialis muscle. flexor digitorum profundus muscle. extensor digitorum communis muscle. lumbricalis muscle. dorsal interossei muscle located on the radial side of the finger. dorsal interossei muscle. force distribution coefficient of muscle i or muscular bound i. weight of phalanx
