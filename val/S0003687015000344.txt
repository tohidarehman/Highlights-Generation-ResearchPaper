 This paper presents a new model based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) to predict oxygen consumption from easily measured variables. The ANFIS prediction model consists of three ANFIS modules for estimating the Flex–HR parameters. Each module was developed based on clustering a training set of data samples relevant to that module and then the ANFIS prediction model was tested against a validation data set. Fifty-eight participants performed the Meyer and Flenghi step-test, during which heart rate (HR) and were measured. Results indicated no significant difference between observed and estimated Flex–HR parameters and between measured and estimated in the overall HR range, and separately in different HR ranges. The ANFIS prediction model (MAE = 3 ml kg−1 min−1) demonstrated better performance than Rennie et al.'s (MAE = 7 ml kg−1 min−1) and Keytel et al.'s (MAE = 6 ml kg−1 min−1) models, and comparable performance with the standard Flex–HR method (MAE = 2.3 ml kg−1 min−1) throughout the HR range. The ANFIS model thus provides practitioners with a practical, cost- and time-efficient method for estimation without the need for individual calibration.

@highlight We present a practical approach based on neuro-fuzzy systems to estimate energy expenditure using heart rate monitoring.
@highlight The proposed approach improves the standard Flex-HR method in that it does not require individual calibration.
@highlight The proposed approach treats the uncertainty in human physiological systems and in various workplaces by using fuzzy logic.
