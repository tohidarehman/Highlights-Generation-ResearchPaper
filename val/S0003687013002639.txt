 Twisting and lateral bending motions in repetitive lifting tasks are associated with occupational low back injuries and can be challenging to reduce with engineering controls. This study tested the hypothesis that twisting and lateral bending can be reduced by changing the transfer distance. Eighteen males, with no material handling experience lifted 10.9 kg boxes from 0.9 m above the floor and placed the boxes at a destination located 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, or 1.75 m away and at heights of 0.5 m, 0.9 m, and 1.3 m above the floor. Overall, twisting and forward bending decreased with increased transfer distance when placing the box. Conversely, the lateral bending when lifting and placing the box increased with increasing transfer distance. In short, having a transfer distance between 1 and 1.25 m when performing palletizing tasks to different heights may optimally balance spine kinematics, back injury risk, and productivity measures.

@highlight Twisting and lateral bending observed during lateral transfer tasks have been associated with increased risk of back injuries.
@highlight Physical separation of the lift origin and destination encourages stepping and turning the body rather than twisting the spine.
@highlight The current research explored the relationship between transfer distance and spine motion during a simulated palletizing task.
@highlight Separating the lift origin and lift destination by 1–1.25 m yielded the best balance between spine kinematics and productivity.
