 This study proposes a nonlocal finite element technique that is based on the super-convergent patch (SCP) second derivative recovery methods. The SCP second derivative recovery methods are proven effective in evaluating the Laplacian of the equivalent strains at C0 linear elements. The element-based patches and their construction criteria are defined. Other patch-based techniques either are limited to structured meshes or only utilize nodal based patches for first derivative recoveries. The SCP technique has not previously been used to recover higher order (2nd and higher) strain derivatives. The proposed technique can deal with unstructured meshes with various element types and the patches are constructed in a fashion that greatly accelerates the evaluation of Hessian matrices. A numerical example of a strain gradient damage mechanics problem is given at the end. The results show that the proposed technique is capable of evaluating the Laplacian of the equivalent strains and has the potential for even higher order derivative recovery.
