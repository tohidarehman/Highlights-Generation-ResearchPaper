 The aim of the present study was to assess the acute low back load of cabin attendants during cart handling and to identify working situations which present the highest strain on the worker. In a setup, 17 cabin attendants (ten females and seven males) pushed, pulled and turned a 20kg standard meal cart (L: 0.5m× W: 0.3m× H: 0.92m) loaded with extra 20kg and 40kg, respectively on two different surfaces (carpet and linoleum) and at three floor inclinations (−2°, 0° and +2°). Two force transducers were mounted as handles. Two-dimensional movement analysis was performed and a 4D WATBAK modelling tool was used to calculate the acute L4–L5 load. No working situations created loads greater than the accepted values for single exertions, however compression and anterior/posterior shear forces during pulling and turning were much higher when compared with pushing. There were significant effects of handling the cart on different floor types, at the varying inclinations and with different cart weights. Additionally, when external forces were reduced, the cabin attendants did not decrease push/pull force proportionally and thus the L4–L5 load did not decrease as much as expected.

@highlight Low back load (L4–L5) during cart acceleration was estimated.
@highlight Working situations creating the highest low back load was identified.
@highlight Effect of handling type, floor type, inclination and cart weight was investigated.
@highlight L4–L5 load was not greater than accepted values for single exertions.
@highlight Effect of decreasing external forces on L4–L5 load was smaller than expected.
