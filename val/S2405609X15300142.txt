 Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using Bruguiera cylindrica (B. cylindrica) leaf extract, the extract was acted as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The formation of AgNPs was observed by UV–vis spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) occurred at 450 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the particles are face centered cubic (fcc) structure and average size of AgNPs was found at 16 nm. Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) suggests that the presence of thirteen functional groups in capping with AgNPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows the well dispersed particles with size of 9–24 nm. Furthermore, the biosynthesized AgNPs were exhibited an excellent cytotoxic effect against MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines.
