 Job engagement has received widespread attention in organizational research but has rarely been empirically investigated in the context of safety. In the present study, we examined the mediating role of job engagement in the relationships between job characteristics and safety performance using self-reported data collected at a coal mining company in China. Most of our study hypotheses were supported. Job engagement partially mediated the relationships between job resources and safety performance dimensions. Theoretical and practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed.

@highlight We examine job engagement as a mediator in the relationships between job characteristics and safety performance.
@highlight Job resources had positive effects on safety performance directly and indirectly through job engagement.
@highlight Job insecurity was negatively related to compliance whereas role overload was positively related to participation.
