 Researchers have pointed out that people with physical disabilities find it difficult to obtain suitable clothing. In this study a set of wheelchair user oriented functional clothing was designed. Attention was paid to the wheelchair users' daily living activities related with clothing. An evaluating system combined with sports tournament and rehabilitation medicine was introduced to assess the new designed clothing. Six wheelchair users (3 males and 3 females) were invited to wear the clothing. A set of normal functional clothing was employed as a comparison (Control). The time required to complete three different daily living activities, i.e. dressing and undressing, going to toilet and bathing were recorded. Results showed that with the new clothing wheelchair users' competence of managing toilet was increased by 52.9%. The time needed for toilet was reduced by 45.7%. Their capability of managing dressing and undressing was improved by 24.6%. The study indicated that the newly designed clothing could facilitate wheelchair users' daily living activities related with clothing.
