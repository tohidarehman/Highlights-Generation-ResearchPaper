 Jens Rasmussen's contribution to the field of human factors and ergonomics has had a lasting impact. Six prominent interrelated themes can be extracted from his research between 1961 and 1986. These themes form the basis of an engineering epistemology which is best manifested by his abstraction hierarchy. Further, Rasmussen reformulated technical reliability using systems language to enable a proper human-machine fit. To understand the concept of human-machine fit, he included the operator as a central component in the system to enhance system safety. This change resulted in the application of a qualitative and categorical approach for human-machine interaction design. Finally, Rasmussen's insistence on a working philosophy of systems design as being a joint responsibility of operators and designers provided the basis for averting errors and ensuring safe and correct system functioning. “It is probably not far from the truth to say that it will always be so - matters relating to an optimal incorporation of humans into systems can be likened to a little life-raft struggling to keep afloat in the wake of the juggernaut of technology - but never catching up. Therefore, any attempts to at least minimize the effects of this unfortunate state of affairs must be based on generalizable concepts and theories which can readily be adapted to a changing world” (Goodstein and Rasmussen, 1980d, p. 41)
