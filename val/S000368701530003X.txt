 This systematic literature review provides information on the use of mixed methods research in human factors and ergonomics (HFE) research in health care. Using the PRISMA methodology, we searched four databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Engineering Village) for studies that met the following inclusion criteria:  field study in health care,  mixing of qualitative and quantitative data,  HFE issues, and  empirical evidence. Using an iterative and collaborative process supported by a structured data collection form, the six authors identified a total of 58 studies that primarily address HFE issues in health information technology (e.g., usability) and in the work of healthcare workers. About two-thirds of the mixed methods studies used the convergent parallel study design where quantitative and qualitative data were collected simultaneously. A variety of methods were used for collecting data, including interview, survey and observation. The most frequent combination involved interview for qualitative data and survey for quantitative data. The use of mixed methods in healthcare HFE research has increased over time. However, increasing attention should be paid to the formal literature on mixed methods research to enhance the depth and breadth of this research.

@highlight Mixed methods research is increasingly used in healthcare HFE research.
@highlight About two-thirds of mixed methods studies on healthcare HFE use the convergent parallel design.
@highlight A large variety of methods is used to collect qualitative and quantitative data.
@highlight The most frequent combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection involved interview and survey respectively.
@highlight Formal mixed methods research approaches should be used in healthcare HFE research.
