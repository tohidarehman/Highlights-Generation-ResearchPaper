 A new method of modeling partial delamination in composite beams is proposed and implemented using the finite element method. Homogenized cross-sectional stiffness of the delaminated beam is obtained by the proposed analytical technique, including extension-bending, extension-twist and torsion-bending coupling terms, and hence can be used with an existing finite element method. A two noded C1 type Timoshenko beam element with 4 degrees of freedom per node for dynamic analysis of beams is implemented. The results for different delamination scenarios and beams subjected to different boundary conditions are validated with available experimental results in the literature and/or with the 3D finite element simulation using COMSOL. Results of the first torsional mode frequency for the partially delaminated beam are validated with the COMSOL results. The key point of the proposed model is that partial delamination in beams can be analyzed using a beam model, rather than using 3D or plate models.
