 Background and aims Single Balloon Enteroscopy enables us to examine the small bowel for various diseases. It provides a view of the intestinal mucosa with biopsy capability, which may be helpful in search of a mucosal disease such as Celiac Disease. Celiac Disease is a proximal enteropathy developed in genetically susceptible individuals to wheat protein gluten. Examination of the duodenum and proximal jejunum are mostly diagnostic. We aimed to review enteroscopic findings of the patients with Celiac Disease. Patients and methods Consecutive adult patients (>18y) who needed intestinal or duodenal biopsy for the diagnosis of the Celiac Disease were included. Single Balloon Enteroscopy system was used to enter the proximal jejunum. All of the patients had biopsies in order to diagnose Celiac Disease. Results Single Balloon Enteroscopy was performed in 33 patients. Twenty two (66.7%) subjects were diagnosed as Celiac Disease. The most common endoscopic abnormality in Celiac Disease was mucosal atrophy in 20 patients (90.9%), continuous involvement was the most common presentation (36.4%). All of the patients with Celiac Disease exhibited at least one endoscopic change. Conclusions This study confirmed the patchy nature of the disease with mostly diffuse involvement of the small bowel. However, any endoscopic abnormality can be found in every patient with Celiac Disease. Analysis of images from either conventional upper endoscopy or capsule endoscopy may aid the diagnosis.

@highlight Celiac Disease is the most common inflammatory disease of the small bowel.
@highlight Variety of endoscopic changes can be found in Celiac Disease patients.
@highlight According to endoscopic and histopathologic data: Celiac Disease is a patchy mucosal disease and every patient with Celiac Disease exhibited at least one or more endoscopic changes through the proximal jejunum.
