 Real time monitoring of driver attention by computer vision techniques is a key issue in the development of advanced driver assistance systems. While past work mostly focused on structured feature-based approaches, characterized by high computational requirements, emerging technologies based on iconic classifiers recently proved to be good candidates for the implementation of accurate and real-time solutions, characterized by simplicity and automatic fast training stages. In this work the combined use of binary classifiers and iconic data reduction, based on Sanger neural networks, is proposed, detailing critical aspects related to the application of this approach to the specific problem of driving assistance. In particular it is investigated the possibility of a simplified learning stage, based on a small dictionary of poses, that makes the system almost independent from the actual user. On-board experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, even in case of noise and adverse light conditions. Moreover the system proved unexpected robustness to various categories of users, including people with beard and eyeglasses. Temporal integration of classification results, together with a partial distinction among visual distraction and fatigue effects, make the proposed technology an excellent candidate for the exploration of adaptive and user-centered applications in the automotive field.
