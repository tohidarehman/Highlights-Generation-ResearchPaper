 The paper proposes a mixed finite element model and experiments its capability in the analysis of elastic and plastic collapse plane problems. The model is easy to formulate and implement because it is based on simple assumptions for the unknown fields. A composite triangular mesh is assumed over the domain. Within each triangular element the displacement field is described by a quadratic interpolation, while the stress field is represented by a piece-wise constant description by introducing a subdivision of the element into three triangular regions. The elastic solution is constructed through the stationarity condition of the mixed Hellingerâ€“Reissner functional. The plastic collapse analysis is formulated as a mathematical programming problem and is accomplished by an Interior Point algorithm which furnishes both the collapse multiplier and the collapse mechanism. A series of numerical experiments shows that the proposed model performs well in elastic problems and achieves the favorite context in plastic analysis, where it takes advantage of the absence of volumetric locking and the piecewise constant interpolation of the stress field within the element.

@highlight The model is particularly simple and easy to implement. Nevertheless the element proves to be accurate and robust in the analysis of both elastic and plastic problems.
@highlight The choice of the displacement and stress interpolations produces an isostatic element which keeps out zero-energy modes.
@highlight The element is locking free.
@highlight The assumed piece-wise constant description of the stress field allows the discontinuities inherent in the plastic solution.
@highlight The numerical experiments, which refer to the analysis of elastic problems and plastic collapse states, show that the element furnishes stable results for both regular and irregular meshes, also with marked distortions.
@highlight The element can be extended, saving the relevant features, to the context of three dimensional analysis.
