 An Element-free Galerkin scaled boundary method (EFG-SBM) based partitioning algorithm is proposed for the 2D steady-state heat transfer analysis of cyclically symmetrical structures. The eigenvalue matrices of EFG-SBM for the rotationally periodic system are proved to be block-circulant under a symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system. Furthermore, both the eigenvalue and system equations can be partitioned into a number of smaller independent problems which are solved by a partitioning algorithm. Numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm in term of computing accuracy and efficiency.
