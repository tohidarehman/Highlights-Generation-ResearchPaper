We propose a new dataset called MixSub that contains research articles from multiple domains.
To prepare MixSub, we crawled the ScienceDirect website and curated articles published in various journals in year 2020. 
We removed the articles that did not contain research highlights. 
Finally, we got 19785 articles with author-written research highlights as shown in Table \ref{Table:MixSub Dataset}. 
Each example in this dataset is organized as \textit{(abstract,  author-written research highlights)}. We have also segmented the dataset into training, validation and test subsets.
