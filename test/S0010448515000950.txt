 We present a precise contact motion planning algorithm for a deformable robot in a planar environment with stationary obstacles. The robot and obstacles are both represented with -continuous implicit or parametric curves. The robot is changing its shape using a single degree of freedom (via a one-parameter family of deformable curves). In order to reduce the dimensionality of the configuration space, geometrically constrained yet collision free contact motions are sought, that have simultaneous tangential contact points between the robot and the obstacles. The -contact motion analysis effectively reduces the degrees of freedom of the robot, which enables a more efficient motion planning. The geometric conditions for the -contact motions can be formulated as a system of non-linear polynomial equations, which can be solved precisely using a multivariate equation solver. The solutions for -contact motions are represented as curves in a 4-dimensional space, where are the degrees of freedom of the rigid motion and is the deformationâ€™s parameter. Using the graph structure of the solution curves for the -contact motions, our algorithm efficiently finds a feasible path connecting two configurations via a graph searching algorithm, whenever available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several examples.
