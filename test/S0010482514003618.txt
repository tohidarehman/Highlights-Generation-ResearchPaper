 Many clinical studies suggest that chronic high sodium intake contributes to the development of essential hypertension and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. In the present study, a system-level computer model has been developed to simulate the long-term effects of increased sodium intake on the LV mechanical functions and the body-fluid homeostasis. The new model couples a cardiovascular hemodynamics function model with an explicit account of the LV wall thickness variation and a long-term renal system model. The present model is validated with published results of clinical studies. The results suggest that, with increased sodium intake, the renal system function, the plasma hormone concentrations, and the blood pressure adapt to new levels of equilibrium. The LV work output and the relative wall thickness increase due to the increase of sodium intake. The results of the present model match well with the patient data.
