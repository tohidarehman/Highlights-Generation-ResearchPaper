 A gas flow deposition (GFD) system was developed to manufacture large-scale organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). A N,N′-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine (α-NPD) thin film with a high purity of 99.97% was obtained using the GFD system. The film properties such as morphology, and electrical and optical characteristics were almost the same as those of films made by conventional vacuum thermal evaporation.
