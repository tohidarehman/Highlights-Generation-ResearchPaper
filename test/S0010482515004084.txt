 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NpC) is rare in the west but common in Southeast Asia and only a few other locations. With the limited geographic incidence, it is relatively under-studied. It also has as co-determinant the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which may adapt to NpC therapies, so not only must a therapeutic compound be found, the discovery process must be rapid, to cope with the changing basis of the EBV. An R-based computer workbench, Mendel, was developed so biologists could quickly upload genomic data, pre-process them, and identify upregulated and downregulated genes. Mendel was used on 10 control and 31 diseased cell lines to discover 3 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that meet thresholds on fold-changes, 3-clique membership, pathway constraints, and druggability. From the DEGs, we conducted a pharmacophore-based screening of 22,723,923 compounds using protein-protein interaction anchor-residue clusters as binding sites. Of the 4 hits, 3 passed all the ADME-Tox tests. These 3 hit compounds, 6-(4-iminiocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene)-4-(thiazol-2-ylcarbamoyl)-1H-pyrimidine-2-thiolate, 1-acetyl]phenyl]-3-phenyl-urea, and (2R)-N4-morpholine-2,4-dicarboxamide have predicted pIC50 values superior to the current drugs fluorouracil (5-FU) and taxotere, which have side effects and face EBV drug resistance.

@highlight We built Mendel, a workbench to analyze dysregulated genes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
@highlight We analyzed druggable genes with high fold changes, cliques, and pathway constraints.
@highlight Using pharmacophores, we virtually screened 22,723,923 compounds to identify 3 hits.
