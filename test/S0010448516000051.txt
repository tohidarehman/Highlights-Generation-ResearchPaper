 CAD model quality in parametric design scenarios largely determines the level of flexibility and adaptability of a 3D model (how easy it is to alter the geometry) as well as its reusability (the ability to use existing geometry in other contexts and applications). In the context of mechanical CAD systems, the nature of the feature-based parametric modeling paradigm, which is based on parent–child interdependencies between features, allows a wide selection of approaches for creating a specific model. Despite the virtually unlimited range of possible strategies for modeling a part, only a small number of them can guarantee an appropriate internal structure which results in a truly reusable CAD model. In this paper, we present an analysis of formal CAD modeling strategies and best practices for history-based parametric design: Delphi’s horizontal modeling, explicit reference modeling, and resilient modeling. Aspects considered in our study include the rationale to avoid the creation of unnecessary feature interdependencies, the sequence and selection criteria for those features, and the effects of parent/child relations on model alteration. We provide a comparative evaluation of these strategies in the form of a series of experiments using three industrial CAD models with different levels of complexity. We analyze the internal structure of the models and compare their robustness and flexibility when the geometry is modified. The results reveal significant advantages of formal modeling methodologies, particularly resilient techniques, over non-structured approaches as well as the unexpected problems of the horizontal strategy in numerous modeling situations.
