 In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of exudates in digital fundus images. Our approach can be divided into three stages: candidate extraction, precise contour segmentation and the labeling of candidates as true or false exudates. For candidate detection, we borrow a grayscale morphology-based method to identify possible regions containing these bright lesions. Then, to extract the precise boundary of the candidates, we introduce a complex active contour-based method. Namely, to increase the accuracy of segmentation, we extract additional possible contours by taking advantage of the diverse behavior of different pre-processing methods. After selecting an appropriate combination of the extracted contours, a region-wise classifier is applied to remove the false exudate candidates. For this task, we consider several region-based features, and extract an appropriate feature subset to train a Naïve–Bayes classifier optimized further by an adaptive boosting technique. Regarding experimental studies, the method was tested on publicly available databases both to measure the accuracy of the segmentation of exudate regions and to recognize their presence at image-level. In a proper quantitative evaluation on publicly available datasets the proposed approach outperformed several state-of-the-art exudate detector algorithms.
