 Background There are two main methods used for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) FEA modeling for medical devices development: patient specific and general approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of both approaches have never been compared in a single study. Method Here we propose a bioinformatic algorithm to evaluate the accuracy of patient specific and generalized FEA approaches with regards to proximity configuration of the implanted stent reconstructed by computed tomography. In addition, in this study we also assessed the impact of the level of detail on FEA accuracy in the patient specific approach. Results Our results demonstrate that in certain cases, the generalized approach can ensure the same accuracy as the patient specific approach. Therefore, considering high cost effectiveness of the generalized approach, we identify it as more feasible in the context of TAVR. Furthermore, we suggest that high level of detail can improve the reproducibility of modeling results in the patient specific approach. Conclusions Our findings may help medical engineers to better understand the peculiarities of both approaches and therefore make the right decision when choosing a particular approach for computer modeling. Future studies are required to validate our observations.

@highlight The modeling of calcium deposits and leaflets will improve the FEA of the TAVR.
@highlight Neither patient specific nor generalized approach has clear advantage over the other.
@highlight Generalized approach is more cost effective way of FEA-based TAVR modeling.
