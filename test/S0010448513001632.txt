 Surface subdivision gains popularity in surface design owing to its flexible applications for geometry with complicated topology and simple computational scheme, and the geometric partial differential equation (GPDE) method is an advanced technology for constructing high-quality smooth surfaces. In this paper, we composite these two ingredients to form a unified method for freeform surface design. We choose the mean curvature flow and Willmore flow as our driven GPDEs, and the finite element method coupled with a hybrid Loop and Catmullâ€“Clark subdivision algorithm as the numerical simulation method. This research presents a novel technique to evaluate the finite element basis functions and the first attempt for constructing the GPDE subdivision surface with hybrid control meshes consisting of triangles and quadrilaterals. Numerical experiments show that the construction method is efficient and robust, yielding high-quality hybrid subdivision surfaces.
