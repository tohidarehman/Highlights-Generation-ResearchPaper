 Through our research on the integration of finite element analysis in the design and manufacturing process with CAD, we have proposed the concept of mesh pre-optimization. This concept consists in converting shape and analysis information in a size map (a mesh sizing function) with respect to various adaptation criteria (refining the mesh around geometric form features, minimizing the geometric discretization error, boundary conditions, etc.). This size map then represents a constraint that has to be respected by automatic mesh generation procedures. This paper introduces a new approach to automatic mesh adaptation around circular holes. This tool aims at optimizing, before any FEA, the mesh of a CAD model around circular holes. This approach, referred to as “a priori” mesh adaptation, should not be regarded as an alternative to adaptive a posteriori mesh refinement but as an efficient way to obtain reasonably accurate FEA results before a posteriori adaptation, which is particularly interesting when evaluating design scenarios. The approach is based on performing many offline FEA analyses on a reference case and deriving, from results and error distributions obtained, a relationship between mesh size and FEA error. This relationship can then be extended to target user specified FEA accuracy objectives in a priori mesh adaptation for any distribution of circular holes. The approach being purely heuristic, fulfilling FEA accuracy objectives, in all cases, cannot be theoretically guaranteed. However, results obtained using varying hole diameters and distributions in 2D show that this heuristic approach is reliable and useful. Preliminary results also show that extension of the method can be foreseen towards a priori mesh adaptation in 3D and mesh adaptation around other types of 2D features.
