 Background The study of biomechanics of deformation and fracture of hard biological tissues involving organic matrix remains a challenge as variations in mechanical properties and fracture mode may have time-dependency. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been widely used but the shortcomings of FEA such as the long computation time owing to re-meshing in simulating fracture mechanics have warranted the development of alternative computational methods with higher throughput. The aim of this study was to compare dynamic two-dimensional FEA and moving particle simulation (MPS) when assuming a plane strain condition in the modeling of human enamel on a reduced scale. Methods Two-dimensional models with the same geometry were developed for MPS and FEA and tested in tension generated with a single step of displacement. The displacement, velocity, pressure, and stress levels were compared and Spearman×³s rank-correlation coefficients R were calculated (p<0.001). Results The MPS and FEA were significantly correlated for displacement, velocity, pressure, and Y-stress. Conclusions The MPS may be further developed as an alternative approach without mesh generation to simulate deformation and fracture phenomena of dental and potentially other hard tissues with complex microstructure.
