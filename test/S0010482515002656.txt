 For decades, many reports have expressed negative opinions about home reliner (HR), because it may result in residual ridge resorption. Recently, some clinical studies evaluated HR. However, the effect of HR on occlusal relationships and the oral mucosa remains unclear. Here, we dynamically analyzed the situation in which a patient applies HR to an upper complete denture. We numerically simulated the effect of HR on occlusal relationships and the oral mucosa. In the simulation, the thickness of HR was set to 2 mm as a proper amount and 4 mm as an excessive amount. The loading points were set at the center of the right and left occlusal surfaces of the denture. Compared with the case without using HR, at proper amounts (2 mm on the right and left sides), HR suppressed the depression of the ill-fitting denture, and stress on the oral mucosa was decreased. In the excessive HR model (4 mm on the right and left sides), the vertical occlusal dimension was increased, and stress on the oral mucosa originally fitted with the denture base was increased. When the denture was modeled in an inclined position (2 mm on the left side and 4 mm on the right side), stress on the oral mucosa on the left buccal side was markedly increased. It was found that when an improper amount of HR was applied, the occlusal vertical dimension increased and the oral mucosa was pressured more than that under non-HR conditions.

@highlight An excessive amount of home reliner (HR) would increase the vertical dimension.
@highlight Denture is set in an inclined position by HR, stress on the mucosa greatly increase.
@highlight Proper amount of HR decentralizes occlusal pressure.
@highlight Proper amount of HR suppresses the depression of ill-fitting denture.
@highlight A well-fitting denture is the most effective for distributing occlusal pressure.
