 An innovative computer-assisted diagnosis system for chronic heart failure (CHF) was proposed in this study, based on cardiac reserve (CR) indexes extraction, heart sound hybrid characteristics extraction and intelligent diagnosis model definition. Firstly, the modified wavelet packet-based denoising method was applied to data pre-processing. Then, the CR indexes such as the ratio of diastolic to systolic duration (D/S) and the amplitude ratio of the first to second heart sound (S1/S2) were extracted. The feature set consisting of the heart sound characteristics such as multifractal spectrum parameters, the frequency corresponding to the maximum peak of the normalized PSD curve (f PSDmax) and adaptive sub-band energy fraction (sub EF) were calculated based on multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), maximum entropy spectra estimation (MESE) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Statistical methods such as t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to analyze the difference of each parameter between the healthy and CHF patients. Finally, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) was employed for the implementation of intelligent diagnosis. The result indicates the achieved diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed system are 95.39%, 96.59% and 93.75% for the detection of CHF, respectively. The selected cutoff values of the diagnosis features are D/S =1.59, S1/S2=1.31, Δα =1.34 and f PSDmax =22.49, determined by ROC curve analysis. This study suggests the proposed methodology could provide a technical clue for the CHF point-of-care system design and be a supplement for CHF diagnosis.
