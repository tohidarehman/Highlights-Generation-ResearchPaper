 In the domain of manual mechanical assembly, expert knowledge is an important means of supporting assembly planning that leads to fewer issues during actual assembly. Knowledge based systems can be used to provide assembly planners with expert knowledge as advice. However, acquisition of knowledge remains a difficult task to automate, while manual acquisition is tedious, time-consuming, and requires engagement of knowledge engineers with specialist knowledge to understand and translate expert knowledge. This paper describes the development, implementation and preliminary evaluation of a method that asks a series of questions to an expert, so as to automatically acquire necessary diagnostic and remedial knowledge as rules for use in a knowledge based system for advising assembly planners diagnose and resolve issues. The method, called a questioning procedure, organizes its questions around an assembly situation which it presents to the expert as the context, and adapts its questions based on the answers it receives from the expert.
