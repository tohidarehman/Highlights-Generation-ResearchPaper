 Objectives Improved Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) approaches will largely benefit the children in need. The constant peak displacement and constant peak force loading methods were analyzed on hard bed for pediatric CPR by an anatomically-detailed 10 year-old (YO) child thorax finite element (FE) model. The chest compression and rib injury risk were studied for children with various levels of thorax stiffness. Methods We created three thorax models with different chest stiffness. Simulated CPR׳s in the above two conditions were performed. Three different compression rates were considered under the constant peak displacement condition. The model-calculated deflections and forces were analyzed. The rib maximum principle strains (MPS׳s) were used to predict the potential risk of rib injury. Results Under the constant peak force condition, the chest deflection ranged from 34.2 to 42.2mm. The highest rib MPS was 0.75%, predicted by the compliant thorax model. Under the normal constant peak displacement condition, the highest rib MPS was 0.52%, predicted by the compliant thorax model. The compression rate did not affect the highest rib MPS. Conclusions Results revealed that the thoracic stiffness had great effects on the quality of CPR. To maintain CPR quality for various children, the constant peak displacement technique is recommended when the CPR is performed on the hard bed. Furthermore, the outcome of CPR in terms of rib strains and total work are not sensitive to the compression rate. The FE model-predicted high strains were in the ribs, which have been found to be vulnerable to CPR in the literature.

@highlight A 10 years old child thorax FE model was used to evaluate CPR loading techniques and compression rates.
@highlight The rib responses were studied and considered as a complementary evaluation for CPR quality.
@highlight The effect of chest stiffness was studied by introducing a softer and stiffer chest.
@highlight The child FE model provided the research community a more child-like surrogate for studying CPR.
