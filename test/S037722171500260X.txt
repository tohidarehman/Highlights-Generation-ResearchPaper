 This paper develops a multi-stage optimization framework for determining periodic inspection intervals for geo-distributed infrastructure systems subject to hidden failures. We assume that the unit’s failure can only be rectified at periodic inspection when a perfect repair is carried out to restore the unit to as-good-as-new condition. For large-scale systems such as fire hydrants in a city, water supply and power transformer distribution networks in urban areas, firstly, we partition the units of a system into groups based on their pre-specified features by a clustering algorithm; then compute an optimal periodic inspection interval for each group based on the expected cost per cycle; and finally, we find the inspection schedule for the whole system that not only minimizes the total inspection and maintenance cost but also satisfies the workforce and budget resource constraints. An integer nonlinear programming formulation and a heuristics are introduced to determine the inspection schedule. The proposed approach is applied to scheduling periodic inspection of large amounts of fire hydrants in a major U.S. city. set of time intervals set of units set of unit clusters = 1 if the kth cluster of units is inspected at the ith interval, 0 otherwise optimal inspection time interval for the kth cluster of units most recent time to do inspection for the kth cluster of units upper bound of τk age of unit n at the time of planning expected unavailable time if a repair action occurs in the kth cluster of units minimum number of times to do inspection for the kth cluster of units maximum number of inspection activities for the ith interval minimum number of inspection activities for the ith interval maximum budget for the ith interval penalty parameter for the optimal time interval number of units in the kth cluster inspection and preventive maintenance cost per unit repair cost per unit penalty cost per unit time if a failure occurs before the next planned inspection time to a unit conditional CDF of failure time for unit n PDF of failure time for unit n
