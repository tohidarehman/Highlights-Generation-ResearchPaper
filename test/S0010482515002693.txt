 Late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can detect the presence of myocardial infarction from ischemic cardiomyopathies (ICM). However, it is more challenging to detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) with this technique due to more subtle and heterogeneous enhancement of the myocardium. This study investigates whether high-resolution LGE CMR can detect age-related myocardial fibrosis using quantitative texture analysis with histological validation. LGE CMR of twenty-four rat hearts (twelve 6-week-old and twelve 2-year-old) was performed using a 7 T MRI scanner. Picrosirius red was used as the histopathology reference for collagen staining. Fibrosis in the myocardium was quantified with standard deviation (SD) threshold methods from the LGE CMR images and 3D contrast texture maps that were computed from gray level co-occurrence matrix of the CMR images. There was a significant increase of collagen fibers in the aged compared to the young rat histology slices (2.60±0.27 %LV vs. 1.24±0.29 %LV, p<0.01). Both LGE CMR and texture images showed a significant increase of myocardial fibrosis in the elderly compared to the young rats. Fibrosis in the LGE CMR images correlated strongly with histology with the 3 SD threshold (r=0.84, y=0.99x+0.00). Similarly, fibrosis in the contrast texture maps correlated with the histology using the 4 SD threshold (r=0.89, y=1.01x+0.00). High resolution ex-vivo LGE CMR can detect the presence of diffuse fibrosis that naturally developed in elderly rat hearts. Our results suggest that texture analysis may improve the assessment of myocardial fibrosis in LGE CMR images. This study assessed age-related diffuse myocardial fibrosis in two different age rat groups using quantitative texture analysis of high resolution ex-vivo late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Results were compared with histological references. There was a significant increase of collagen fibers (%LV fibrosis) in the LGE CMR and contrast texture images of the elderly compared to the young group. Our results suggest that texture analysis may improve the assessment of subtle age-related myocardial fibrosis from LGE CMR images with a higher separability and increased SNR.
