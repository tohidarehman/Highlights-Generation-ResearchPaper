 Coronary bifurcation lesions are complex. Whether a critical condition exists in the stenotic side branch (SB) of bifurcation lesions, according to the Medina classification, is unassessed. Computational models of coronary bifurcations were developed with different stenosis severities and locations, in order to study the flow distribution and wall shear stress (WSS) in the SB. It was found that bifurcation lesion type (1,0,1) had a flow ratio of 0.25, much less than the corresponding normal ratio of 0.47, and the 0.46 and 0.39 ratios computed for lesion types (0,1,1) and (1,1,1), respectively. Bifurcation type (1,0,1) was associated with a 47% reduction from normal coronary flow, resulting in coronary branch steal. Blood flow to the SB decreased as the stenosis severity increased and approached the carina, in the proximal, distal, and side branches. Similarly, WSS values decreased with increasing stenosis severity. Bifurcation type (1,0,1) had the lowest WSS values in the SB, and were below the 0.5Pa threshold for atherosclerotic growth. In conclusion, the results suggest that lesion type (1,0,1) is at the greatest risk of coronary branch steal, leading to potential ischemia, as well as further atherosclerotic growth. This is counterintuitive to the Medina classification, where bifurcation type (1,1,1) is usually considered the most severe.

@highlight Numerical models were generated to investigate stenotic side branch hemodynamics.
@highlight We studied the effect of stenosis severity and location on WSS and blood perfusion.
@highlight Low blood perfusion was found in type (1,0,1), corresponding to branch steal.
@highlight Critically low WSS developed along the outer wall in the SB of lesion type (1,0,1).
@highlight This is counterintuitive to the Medina classification where (1,1,1) is most severe.
