 Developing a real time method for the localization of muscle activity regions from high density surface electromyogram (EMG). The inverse problem of source localization is solved by a regularized technique applied to an over-determined problem searching for the least mean squares approximation of the recorded signal with a linear combination of a set of basis waveforms (subject specific). The method, tested on simulations, provides accurate estimates of the mean location of the sources (in ideal conditions, it has about 1 mm of mean error in locating the depth, negligible error in locating the transverse location of the active region). For reasonably small perturbations, it is stable to possible detection problems (e.g., misalignment between the electrodes and the fibres, noise), inaccurate knowledge of the anatomical and physical properties of the investigated tissues (e.g., tissue thickness, location of IZ, fibre length, tissue conductivity) with mean estimation errors of about 1.5â€“2.8 mm. An innovative algorithm is proposed for the non-invasive localization of the active regions of a muscle. It is real time and opens potential future applications for prosthesis control and biofeedback. The paper proposes an innovative method to identify the regions of a muscle which are active from high density surface electromyogram (EMG). The same problem was addressed in very few studies in the literature, by either using a set of predetermined waveforms to approximate the recorded signal or by computationally expensive regularized techniques. No method available in literature is both robust and real time. The algorithm proposed in the paper is based on a set of waveforms adapted to the investigated subject and a regularization technique. It is separated into two steps: a preliminary processing in which the waveforms are selected and most of the computations are performed (off-line step) and a fast algorithm, requiring only a few matrix multiplications, which can be used in real time (main innovation of the paper). An example of application is shown in . A sensitivity analysis is performed in simulation. The perturbation of different parameters determines a bias in the estimation of the active regions which is interpreted and discussed in the paper. Even in the presence of a bias, the relative depth of the sources is maintained, with an uncertainty of a few mm. An experimental validation of the algorithm is beyond the aims of the paper. It is very difficult to address such a problem, as it is not simple to locate the sources in experiments. Some ideas for future works for the experimental validation of the algorithm are discussed. The estimation of the active regions may substantially contribute to many open issues in the surface EMG research field: for example, cross-talk removal, force estimation, biofeedback, prosthesis control, load sharing among muscles acting on the same joint and motor unit number estimation. Some of these problems would benefit of even an approximate estimation, but it should be real time (processing time is shown in ). Thus, the proposed algorithm could give a valuable contribution to the work of many researchers focused on one of these challenging problems. . Example of application of the algorithm.
