 This paper introduces a successive perturbation-based method for multiscale stochastic analysis of heterogeneous materials such as composite materials. Microscopic random variations sometimes have a significant influence on homogenized material properties and microscopic stress fields. Therefore, multiscale stochastic problems should be analyzed to evaluate the reliability of composite structures. Further, in order to assess the result of numerical analysis of a composite structure, this type of uncertainty propagation should be taken into account. For this purpose, the successive perturbation based approach is proposed. As a numerical example, the stochastic homogenization and multiscale stochastic stress analysis problem of composite materials are solved considering microscopic random variations. From the numerical results, the proposed approach gives a more accurate estimation than the conventional perturbation approach. Also, our proposed method works well for both smooth nonlinear response functions and non-smooth response functions.
