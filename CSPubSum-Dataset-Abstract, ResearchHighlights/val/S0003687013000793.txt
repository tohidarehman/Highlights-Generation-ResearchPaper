 This study was to see the effect of different coatings on the handle of hand-held drilling machines. Out of five different handles chosen for this study, including one handle uncoated. Root mean square (rms) values of the vibration levels (acceleration) were recorded at the surface of handle and wrist of the operators. Results showed that maximum vibrations were reduced by coating of handle coated with rubber sheet and Rexene (H4) followed by handle coated with cotton sandwiched between jeans cloth (H5). Equivalent vibrations transmitted through coating of handles coated with sponge and velvet (H2) and jute and cotton (H3) were of almost same magnitude and these two coated handles were able to reduce least vibration transmitted. Transmissibility of vibrations along dominant (Z) direction was analyzed using ANOVA. Results showed that coating on handles significantly affected vibration transmitted in Z direction. Vibration transmissibility ratios were found to be 0.354, 0.571, 0.408, 0.4326, and 0.3555 for handles H1, H2, H3, H4 and H5 respectively.

@highlight Vibration levels at the surface of handle of drill machine were achieved using coating instead of gloves.
