 Haul truck drivers at surface mines are exposed to whole-body vibration for extended periods. Thirty-two whole-body vibration measurements were gathered from haul trucks under a range of normal operating conditions. Measurements taken from 30 of the 32 trucks fell within the health guidance caution zone defined by ISO2631-1 for an 8 h daily exposure suggesting, according to ISO2631-1, that “caution with respect to potential health risks is indicated”. Maintained roadways were associated with substantially lower vibration amplitudes. Larger trucks were associated with lower vibration levels than small trucks. The descriptive nature of the research, and small sample size, prevents any strong conclusion regarding causal links. Further investigation of the variables associated with elevated vibration levels is justified. Relevance to industry The operators of mining equipment such as haul trucks are exposed to whole-body vibration amplitudes which have potential to lead to long term health effects. Systematic whole-body vibration measurements taken at frequent intervals are required to provide an understanding of the causes of elevated vibration levels and hence determine appropriate control measures.
