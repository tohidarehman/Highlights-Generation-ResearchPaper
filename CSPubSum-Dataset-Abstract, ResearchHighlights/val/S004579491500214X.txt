 This paper introduces a nonlinear reduced-order modelling methodology for finite-element models of structures with slender subcomponents and inertia represented by lumped masses along main load paths. The constructed models have dynamics described by 1-D intrinsic equations of motion, which are further written in modal co-ordinates. This yields finite-dimensional approximations of the system dynamics with only quadratic nonlinearities. Evaluation of the problem coefficients is performed from static condensation of the original model on the lumped masses. The method exploits the multi-point constraints typically used to obtain sectional loads in aircraft aeroelastic analysis. The technique is illustrated on simple 3D structural models built using solid elements. cross-sectional compliance matrix beam internal forces in material coordinates applied forces/moments per unit beam length beam curvatures in material coordinates initial beam curvatures in material coordinates stiffness matrix in reduced set of 3-D FEM problem beam internal moments in material coordinates mass matrix in reduced set of 3-D FEM problem cross-sectional mass matrix beam local position vector intrinsic modal coordinates (all components) intrinsic modal coordinates (velocity component) intrinsic modal coordinates (stress resultant component) beam local coordinate transformation matrix curvilinear coordinate along main load path time beam local displacements in material coordinates beam translational velocities in material coordinates skew-symmetric matrix with natural frequencies local translational/angular velocity state vector internal force/moment state vector natural mode shape j in global displacements natural mode shape j in intrinsic velocities natural mode shape j in intrinsic sectionalforces discrete mode shape j in reduced set of 3-D FEM problem diagonal matrix with natural frequencies beam angular velocities in material coordinates cutoff angular frequency natural angular frequency of mode j scalar part of quaternion vector part of quaternion
