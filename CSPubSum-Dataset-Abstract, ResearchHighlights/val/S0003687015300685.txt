 Objective To study the effects of wearing extravehicular activity (EVA) gloves on grip strength and fatigue in low temperature, low pressure and mixing of two factors (low temperature and low pressure). Methods The maximum grip strength and fatigue tests were performed with 10 healthy male subjects wearing gloves in a variety of simulated environments. The data was analysed using the normalization method. Results The results showed that wearing gloves significantly affected the maximum grip strength and fatigue. Pressure (29.6, 39.2 kPa) had more influence on the maximum grip compared with control group while low temperatures (−50, −90, −110 °C) had no influence on grip but affected fatigue dramatically. The results also showed that the maximum grip strength and fatigue were influenced significantly in a compound environment. Conclusions Space environment remarkably reduced strength and endurance of the astronauts. However, the effects brought by the compound environment cannot be understood as the superimposition of low temperature and pressure effects.

@highlight Both pressure and low temperature would reduce the strength and fatigue of EVA gloves.
@highlight The maximum grip strength and fatigue were influenced significantly in low temperature and pressure.
@highlight For long hours of work, the effect of low temperature is greater than the effect of pressure.
