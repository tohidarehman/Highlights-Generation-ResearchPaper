 Physical work demands and posture constraint from operating microscopes may adversely affect microsurgeon health and performance. Alternative video displays were developed to reduce posture constraints. Their effects on postures, perceived efforts, and performance were compared with the microscope. Sixteen participants performed microsurgery skill tasks using both stereo and non-stereoscopic microscopes and video displays. Results showed that neck angles were 9–13° more neutral and shoulder flexion were 9–10° more elevated on the video display than the microscope. Time observed in neck extension was higher (30% vs. 17%) and neck movements were 3x more frequent on the video display than microscopes. Ratings of perceived efforts did not differ among displays, but usability ratings were better on the microscope than the video display. Performance times on the video displays were 66–110% slower than microscopes. Although postures improved, further research is needed to improve task performance on video displays.

@highlight Compared with microscopes, neck posture was more neutral and neck movements were more frequent on the video displays.
@highlight Task completion times didn’t differ between 2D and 3D, but times were slower on the video displays than the microscope.
@highlight Video displays reduce posture constraints and may reduce musculoskeletal symptoms and fatigue in microsurgery.
