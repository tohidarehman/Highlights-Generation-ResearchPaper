 This study investigated both causal factors and consequences of time pressure in hospital-in-the-home (HITH) nurses. These nurses may experience additional stress from the time pressure they encounter while driving to patients' homes, which may result in greater risk taking while driving. From observation in natural settings, data related to the nurses' driving behaviours and emotions were collected and analysed statistically; semi-directed interviews with the nurses were analysed qualitatively. The results suggest that objective time constraints alone do not necessarily elicit subjective time pressure. The challenges and uncertainty associated with healthcare and the driving period contribute to the emergence of this time pressure, which has a negative impact on both the nurses' driving and their emotions. Finally, the study focuses on anticipated and in situ regulations. These findings provide guidelines for organizational and technical solutions allowing the reduction of time pressure among HITH nurses.

@highlight We examined time pressure in hospital-in-the-home nurses while they were driving.
@highlight Time pressure has a negative impact on both the nurses' driving and their emotions.
@highlight Time constraints are neither necessary nor sufficient to elicit time pressure.
@highlight The challenges and uncertainty associated with healthcare and driving are relevant.
@highlight Anticipated and in situ regulations may reduce uncertainties and negative emotions.
