 In this paper, a finite element model is proposed for analysing friction process derived from an experimental tribometer set-up able to reproduce severe contact conditions under dynamic loading. A pair of low carbon steel is studied when interacting for a sliding velocity varying from 15 to 82m/s and a normal pressure of 50 and 200MPa. The specificity of this device lies in the high-speed range with a maximum velocity close to 120m/s. This high-speed range requires taking into account the dynamic phenomena due to fast loading and short transition time. The numerical simulations for the main objectives have to propose a support for the experimental signals analyse (inverse method) and to validate the calibration of the measuring device. The phenomena generated by the dynamic loading are highlighted and allows defining precisely the measurements and the physical quantities obtained during the tests. Therefore several recommendations are proposed to improve experimental data analysis considering structure effects related to the device.
