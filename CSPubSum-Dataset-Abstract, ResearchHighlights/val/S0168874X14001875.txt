 Three models were developed to simulate the transfer of prestress force from steel to concrete in pre-tensioned concrete elements. The first is an analytical model based on the thick-walled cylinder theory and considers linear material properties for both steel and concrete. The second is an axi-symmetric finite element (FE) model with linear material properties; it is used to verify the analytical model. The third model is a three dimensional nonlinear FE model. This model considers the post-cracking behaviour of concrete as well as concrete shrinkage and the time of prestress releasing. A new expression from the analytical model is developed to estimate the transmission length as well as the stress distribution along the tendon. The paper also presents a parametric study to illustrate the impact of diameter of prestressing steel, concrete cover, concrete strength, initial prestress, section size, surface roughness of prestressing steel, time of prestress release, and the member length on the transfer of stress in pre-tensioned concrete elements. cross sectional area of concrete cross sectional area of prestressing steel internal radius of cylinder external radius of cylinder the nominal diameter of the prestressing length of small element in longitudinal direction Young׳s modulus concrete Young׳s modulus prestressing steel Young׳s modulus eccentricity, which defines the rate at which the function approaches the asymptote average longitudinal stress in concrete at x concrete compressive strength after 28 days in MPa longitudinal stress in prestressing steel at x bond stress at x effective prestress (beyond transmission zone) initial prestress tensile strength Drucker–Prager hyperbolic function of flow potential fracture energy ratio of the second invariant on the tensile meridian to that on compressive meridian transmission length number of mesh segments around the tendon radial pressure applied internal pressure in the radial direction applied external pressure in the radial direction hydrostatic pressure von Mises equivalent stress deformed nominal radius of the prestressing strands or bars nominal radius of prestressing steel bar internal radius of concrete cylinder which equals radius of steel bar after prestressing external radius of concrete cylinder age in days degree of temperature radial deformation at a radius equal r radial deformation of pre-stressing bar at the outer perimeter radial deformation of concrete cylinder at the inner perimeter position along the transmission length coefficient of thermal expansion change in temperature shrinkage strain Poisson׳s ratio Poisson׳s ratio of concrete Poisson׳s ratio of steel initial equibiaxial compressive yield stress uni-axial compressive yield stress maximum principal effective stress uni-axial tensile stress at failure applied stress in the longitudinal direction tangential stress coefficient of friction angle of dilation
