 Advances in police-specific technology have led to changes in work layout and physical occupational demands of mobile police officers. This study investigated the influence of police cruiser compartment configuration on perceived discomfort, muscle activation, shoulder kinematics, and typing performance during simulated police patrol. Participants completed a one-hour session including simulated driving and 2-min typing trials in a standard compartment configuration with a fixed mobile data terminal (MDT) location (ST), and in a modified compartment configuration with an MDT in front of the user and a rearward translated seat (MOD). The MOD configuration resulted in reductions of 55–65% in perceived shoulder discomfort, up to 3.4% MVC in shoulder muscle demands, and more neutral humeral orientations (shoulder elevation reduced by 13–25°). These improvements associated with the MOD configuration may have ergonomic implications for future police car designs, particularly as new technology is introduced in the mobile environment and advanced solutions are sought.

@highlight We compare current and modified police cruiser restraint cage configurations.
@highlight Bilateral shoulder discomfort was reduced while typing directly in front of the body.
@highlight Location of the laptop in front of the user allows more neutral shoulder postures.
@highlight Reduced discomfort is likely driven by postures, not muscle demands.
@highlight Reduced discomfort results may have implications for future police car designs.
