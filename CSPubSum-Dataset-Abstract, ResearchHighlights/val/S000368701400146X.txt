 The study aimed to determine the risk factors for incident carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in a large working population, with a special focus on factors related to work organization. In 2002– workers were assessed and, in 2007– were re-examined. At baseline all completed a self-administered questionnaire about personal/medical factors and work exposure. CTS symptoms and physical examination signs were assessed by a standardized medical examination at baseline and follow-up. The risk of “symptomatic CTS” was higher for women (OR = 2.9 ) and increased linearly with age (OR = 1.04  for 1-year increment). Two work organizational factors remained in the multivariate risk model after adjustment for the personal/medical and biomechanical factors: payment on a piecework basis (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.1–3.5) and work pace dependent on automatic rate (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 0.9–4.1). Several factors related to work organization were associated with incident CTS after adjustment for potential confounders.

@highlight The study showed the association of CTS with some factors related to the work organization.
@highlight Payment on a piecework basis was associated with increased risk of CTS.
@highlight Work pace dependent on automatic rate was associated with increased risk of CTS.
@highlight Work organization should be an important target for the prevention of CTS.
