 In this paper, a two-layer partial composite columns model is built based on Reddy׳s higher order beam theory, and two novel displacement based finite elements for this and Timoshenko composite beams are respectively formulated by means of the principle of minimum potential energy. Subsequently, the buckling analyses of pinned–pinned and clamped–guided composite columns are performed using the proposed finite elements, and the results are compared with those obtained by plane stress model, Timoshenko and Newmark composite beams model respectively. The superior quality of Reddy composite columns model over Timoshenko composite columns model and the correctness of the proposed Timoshenko composite columns model are demonstrated by the numerical comparison. Finally, the parametric study explores effects of parameters including stiffness of shear connectors, span-to-depth ratios, Young׳s modulus ratios and sub-layer׳s depth on the buckling load. The discrepancies between the performance of higher order and Timoshenko composite columns have also been numerically investigated.
