 Background The purpose of this investigation was to examine if paramedics' frequency of being exposed to highly physically demanding activities, or their perception of physical, clinical, and emotional demands were altered by patients' acuity level, operationalized using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). Methods Physical demands descriptions (PDD) were compiled from thirteen services across Canada. The observation sessions took place during a minimum of two full-shift (12-h) ride-outs at each service. Data were obtained from 53 ride-outs, which included a total of 190 calls. Results Higher urgency calls (CTAS level I or II) required significantly more stretcher handling, equipment handling, and intravenous (IV) work, also prompting higher ratings of perceived clinical, physical, and emotional demand. Independent of CTAS level, stretcher loading with patient (15.0%), horizontal patient transfer (13.7%), and pushing/pulling the stretcher with patient (13.1%) were identified as the most physically demanding tasks. Conclusions Patient acuity is an important determinant affecting the frequency for which paramedics are exposed to work tasks with inherent ergonomic hazards (e.g., handling a stretcher with a patient). Patient acuity also affects paramedics' perceived clinical, physical, and emotional demands of a call.

@highlight Patient acuity (call urgency) is a determinant of paramedics' physical demands.
@highlight Urgent calls required more physically demanding actions.
@highlight Moderately urgent calls required the longest time to transfer care at the hospital.
@highlight Urgent calls are perceived as more emotionally, clinically and physically demanding.
