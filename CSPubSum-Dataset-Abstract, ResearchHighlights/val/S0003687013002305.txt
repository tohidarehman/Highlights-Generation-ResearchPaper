 This paper introduced a laboratory study on quantifying the impact of display angles 0.0°–90.0° on the legibility of Sans-Serif 5 × 5 Capitalized Letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z, commonly used for acuity tests. This study addressed three issues not tackled in the previous studies, including (a) extremely large incident angles 82.8°–90°, (b) multiple letters other than a single letter E previously used, and (c) the interference of people's normal reading habit on legibility evaluation. A total of 20 young college students with Snellen acuity 20/20 or better and normal color vision participated in this experiment. They were asked to read viewing materials presented at 15 display angles. This study derived two equations and modified an existing legibility index to correct the interference of people's normal reading habit on legibility evaluation at extreme oblique display angles. vertical viewing angle horizontal viewing angle incident angle between the display normal and an observer's sightline the threshold incident angle, where the viewing materials were readable by 50% of the young subjects the largest incident angle at which the materials could still be readable with 100% accuracy solid angle subtended by the legible text viewed at any angles color contrast normal text area, A = W × H observer's visual acuity level observer's age luminance contrast luminance contrast percent viewing distance to the display viewed at any angles viewing distance to the display viewed perpendicularly adjusted viewing distance the height of the LED panel used in this study to provide the uniform display window, in mm normal text height height-to-strokewidth-ratio of text background luminance surrounding luminance of the ambient environment target luminance conventional legibility index, LI = D/H a new legibility index to evaluate text and graphics viewed at different display angles, LI′ = ω −0.5 modified legibility index to correct the interference of people's normal reading habit on evaluating the legibility levels of characters viewed at extreme oblique display angles minimum angle of resolution denominator of an observer's Snellen acuity strokewidth of text visual angle subtended by the legible text normal text width
