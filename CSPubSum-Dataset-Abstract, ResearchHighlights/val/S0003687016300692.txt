 Increased task demand will increase the pilot mental workload (PMWL). When PMWL is increased, mental overload may occur resulting in degraded performance. During pilots' instrument flight rules (IFR) proficiency test, PMWL is typically not measured. Therefore, little is known about workload during the proficiency test and pilots' potential to cope with higher task demands than those experienced during the test. In this study, fighter pilots' performance and PMWL was measured during a real IFR proficiency test in an F/A-18 simulator. PMWL was measured using heart rate (HR) and heart rate variation (HRV). Performance was rated using Finnish Air Force's official rating scales. Results indicated that HR and HRV differentiate varying task demands in situations where variations in performance are insignificant. It was concluded that during a proficiency test, PMWL should be measured together with the task performance measurement.

@highlight During an instrument flight rules proficiency test, heart rate (HR)/heart rate variation (HRV) are sensitive measures of varying levels of pilot mental workload.
@highlight During an instrument flight rules proficiency test, HR/HRV can distinguish fighter pilots' mental workload differences in situations where variations in performance are either insignificant or significant.
@highlight HR/HRV measuring adds value to instrument flight rules proficiency testing.
