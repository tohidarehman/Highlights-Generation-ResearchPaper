 This study hypothesized that in a longitudinal setting deteriorating physical working conditions increases the perceived physical and mental strain among food processing employees. The study was conducted in 2003 and 2007. It examined 248 blue-collar workers, all of whom were in the same occupation throughout the entire follow-up period. The data were obtained through a structural questionnaire distributed to the employees at the workplace. Mental strain had increased (7%) significantly among younger employees during the follow-up. The changes in mental strain for the younger employees were positively associated with the changes in physical strain. The changes in physical strain were also significantly associated with the changes in physical working conditions among both younger and the older workers. The results of this study partly support the study hypothesis, namely that deteriorating physical working condition increases physical strain and also increases mental strain, especially among younger employees. Perceived exertion is the single best indicator of the degree of physical strain . The perceived exertion (RPE) scale values range from 6 to 20 and can be used to denote heart rates ranging from 60 to 200 beats/min. This scale is easier to use because a certain value on the scale, e.g. 13, would match approximately a heart rate of 130 beats/min for 30–50-year-old subjects. Details of the scale: 6 – No exertion at all 7 – Extremely light 8 – 9 – Very light 10 – 11 – Light 12 – 13 – Somewhat hard 14 – Hard (heavy) 15 – 16 – Very hard 17 – 18 – 19 – Extremely hard 20 – Maximal exertion

@highlight Deteriorating physical working conditions increases physical and mental strain among food industry workers.
@highlight The change in physical strain was associated with the change in mental strain.
@highlight Younger employees were mostly affected due to poorer ergonomic factors at work.
