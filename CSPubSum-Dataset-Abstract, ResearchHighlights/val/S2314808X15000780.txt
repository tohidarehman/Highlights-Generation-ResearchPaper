 The new acenaphthaquinone-4-phenyl thiosemicarbazone (APTH) was synthesized. The reaction of Hg(II) and Cd(II) chloride with APTH yields bimetallic complexes, which are characterized by elemental, IR, UV-Vis., 1H-NMR and Mass spectroscopy. The APTH employed as a chelating agent for CPE procedure of trace amounts of mercury and cadmium from aqueous medium. The Hg(II) and Cd(II) is preconcentrated using 0.1% w/v Triton X-114 and 2 × 10−5 M APTH at pH 7. The calibration curve is linear in the ranges 0.25–3 and 0.25–7.5 ng/ml for Cd(II) and Hg(II), respectively. The proposed method was applied successfully in the determination of Hg(II) and Cd(II) in different water samples.
