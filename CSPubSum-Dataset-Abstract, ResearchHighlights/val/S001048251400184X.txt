 Computer technology is widely used for multimodal image analysis of the prostate gland. Several techniques have been developed, most of which incorporate a priori knowledge extracted from organ features. Knowledge extraction and modeling are multi-step tasks. Here, we review these steps and classify the modeling according to the data analysis methods employed and the features used. We conclude with a survey of some clinical applications where these techniques are employed.
