 An intergroup case study was undertaken to determine if: 1) There exist distinct mental models of home heating function, that differ significantly from the actual functioning of UK heating systems; and 2) Mental models of thermostat function can be categorized according to Kempton' valve and feedback shared theories, and others from the literature. Distinct, inaccurate mental models of the heating system, as well as thermostat devices in isolation, were described. It was possible to categorise thermostat models by Kempton' feedback shared theory, but other theories proved ambiguous. Alternate control devices could be categorized by Timer  and Switch  theories. The need to consider the mental models of the heating system in terms of an integrated set of control devices, and to consider user's goals and expectations of the system benefit, was highlighted. The value of discovering shared theories, and understanding user mental models, of home heating, are discussed with reference to their present day relevance for reducing energy consumption.

@highlight An intergroup case study identified distinct mental models of home heating that explained users reported behaviour.
@highlight Research into alternate control devices to the thermostat, may have greater present day relevance for reducing CO2.
@highlight Home heating needs to be considered at the system, rather than device, level incorporating goals and the device benefit.
