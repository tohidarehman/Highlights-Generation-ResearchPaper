 The objective of this study was to assess the protective effect of black berry juice (BBJ) on the neurological disorders and oxidative stress induced by co-exposure to ALCL3 and NaF in male albino rats. Administration of either AlCl3 (200 mg/kg bw) or NaF (10 mg/kg bw) or both of them caused a significant increase in serum and brain TL, TC, TG as well as serum LDLC and VLDLC levels while serum HDLC level was decreased significantly. Additionally, brain neurotransmitter (DA and 5-HT) levels, AChE, Na-K ATPase activity and ATP values were decreased significantly but NE level was increased in rats administered Al or F alone or in combination. Moreover, a significant increase in brain MDA, NO, H2O2 and free radical enzyme (xanthine oxidase (XO)) and a significant decrease in the level of TAC, SOD and GSH were recorded in AlCl3 or NaF intoxicated rats. In addition, the levels of serum Na, Ca, Cu and zinc (Zn) were significantly diminished, while the level of K was significantly increased. However ALCL3 appears to enhance the neurotoxic hazards caused by NaF. On the other hand, the administration of BBJ (1.6 g/kg bw) showed a marked neuroprotective effect against the biochemical abnormalities that occurred and oxidative stress of the brain induced by co-exposure to AlCl3 and NaF. So, it can be concluded that the consumption of BBJ might be useful for alleviating the neurological disorders and oxidative stress associated with concurrent exposure of ALCL3 and NaF indicating its free radical scavenging and potent antioxidant activity.
