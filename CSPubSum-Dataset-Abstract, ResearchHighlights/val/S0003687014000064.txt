 The aims of this study were to test the effects of two pressure relief insoles developed for backpackers and obese people on the ground reaction forces (GRF) and plantar pressure peaks during gait; and to compare the GRF and plantar pressures among normal-weight, backpackers, and obese participants. Based on GRF, plantar pressures, and finite element analysis two insoles were manufactured: flat cork-based insole with (i) corkgel in the rearfoot and forefoot (SLS1) and with (ii) poron foam in the great toe and lateral forefoot (SLS2). Gait data were recorded from 21 normal-weight/backpackers and 10 obese participants. The SLS1 did not influence the GRF, but it relieved the pressure peaks for both backpackers and obese participants. In SLS2 the load acceptance GRF peak was lower; however, it did not reduce the plantar pressure peaks. The GRF and plantar pressure gait pattern were different among the normal-weight, backpackers and obese participants.

@highlight Backpackers and obese subjects were benefited by using pressure relief insoles.
@highlight One of the insoles better distributed the plantar pressures during the loaded gait.
@highlight The vertical ground reaction force was decreased when one of the insoles was used.
@highlight Different materials in the insoles influenced the plantar pressures and forces.
@highlight Gait biomechanics is different among normal-weight, backpackers and obese subjects.
