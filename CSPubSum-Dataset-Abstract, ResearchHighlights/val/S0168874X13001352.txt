 In the past, structural model updating methods have been widely researched as a means to reconcile mathematical models because the key parameters in dynamic systems often change during their life cycle due to repair and replacement of parts or the environment. However, there is very little literature that references model updating under the condition of complicated multi-physics fields such as a high temperature environment (HTE). In this paper, model updating in an HTE is proposed based on the hierarchical method, and an iterative procedure is presented. With this method, the temperature field updating of a structure is taken as the first stage, and the multi-objective optimization method and a surrogate model of radial-basis functions are introduced to improve the robustness and efficiency of this stage, respectively. Then, the temperature distribution achieved from the former is imposed on the structure as a thermal load, and the residuals of the modal characteristics are taken as objective functions to update the dynamic model of the structure in HTE. The proposed method is tested on an FE model of a wing model, and the analysis of variance approach is employed to evaluate the parameter variability significance and to select the updating variable. The results of the study show that the developed hierarchical method is capable of identifying the input parameters of the temperature field and structure with good accuracy.
