 Background Obesity is associated with productivity loss, but little is known about how obese workers function at work and also the role of working-time arrangements on this association is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the association of overweight and obesity with work functioning (WF), and to determine whether the associations differ between workers with different working-time arrangements. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted within the sampling frame of the ‘Shift Your Work’ study that examined the effect of irregular working-times in relation to health and functioning at work. We included N = 622 Dutch employees, of which N = 384 (62%) were shift-workers, N = 171 (27%) on-call workers and N = 67 (11%) day-workers. Overweight and obesity were defined as BMI 25–30 and ≥30, respectively. WF was assessed using the Work-Role Functioning Questionnaire. Results The prevalences of overweight and obesity were 48% and 10% in all workers, 49% and 11% in shift-workers, 45% and 10% in on-call workers, and 49% and 6% in day workers, respectively. In all workers, obesity was associated with lower WF scores for physical demands (adjusted estimate, aB = −5.5). In shift-workers, obesity was associated with lower WF scores for output and physical demands (aB = −8.8 and −6.8, respectively). In day and on-call workers, overweight and obesity were not associated with WF. Conclusions Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent in the working population. Obesity might reduce the executive function performance beyond physical limitations, and limit the ability to accomplish tasks successfully, especially in shift workers.

@highlight We examine how obese workers function at work and the role of working-time arrangements.
@highlight We assesse work functioning with the Work-Role Functioning Questionnaire.
@highlight Obesity is associated with lower work functioning scores for physical demands in all workers.
@highlight In shift workers, obesity is also associated with lower work functioning for output demands.
@highlight In day and on-call workers, obesity is not associated with lower work functioning and work demands.
