 The Koiter–Newton approach is a novel reduced order modeling technique for buckling analysis of geometrically nonlinear structures. The load carrying capability of the structure is achieved by tracing the entire equilibrium path in a stepwise manner. At each step a reduced order model generated from Koiter׳s asymptotic expansion provides a nonlinear prediction for the full model, corrected by a few Newton steps. The construction of the reduced order model requires derivatives of the strain energy with respect to the degrees of freedom up to the fourth order, which is two orders more than traditionally needed for a Newton based nonlinear finite element technique. In this paper we adopt the co-rotational formulation to facilitate these complex differentiations. We extend existing co-rotational beam and shell element formulations to make them applicable for the high order derivatives of the strain energy. The geometrical nonlinearities are taken into account using derivatives of the local co-rotational frame with respect to global degrees of freedom. This is done outside the standard element routines and is thus independent of the element type. We utilize three configurations and the nonlinear rotation matrix to describe finite rotations of the shell accurately, and profit from the automatic differentiation technique to optimize the programming of high order derivatives. The performance of the proposed approach using the co-rotational formulation is demonstrated using benchmark examples of isotropic and laminated composite structures. number of degrees of freedom in the full finite element model number of degrees of freedom in the reduced order model number of closely spaced buckling modes external load, internal load and residual force displacements in current and nominal configurations relative displacement from nominal configuration to current configuration load parameters at current and nominal configurations increment of load parameter from nominal to current configurations linear, quadratic and cubic forms in expansion of equilibrium equations 2D, 3D and 4D tensors of load matrix, load amplitude and sub-loads generalized displacement and first to third order displacement fields linear, quadratic and cubic forms in reduced order model 2D, 3D and 4D tensors of tangent stiffness matrix α-th unit vector column vectors of tensors , components of tensor linear displacement of the structure under the external load ext node number global coordinate system co-rotational frame in reference configuration co-rotational frame in nominal configurations global and local degrees of freedom components in global degrees of freedom components in local degrees of freedom initial and current length of beam angle between nominal configuration and x-axis angle between reference configuration and x-axis angle between reference and nominal configurations position vectors of nodes a and b in reference configuration position vectors of nodes a and b in nominal configuration curvature, area of cross section and strain energy global and local internal loads, linear stiffness coordinates of nodes a and b in initial configuration node number global coordinate system axes in co-rotational frames in reference and nominal configurations axes in axes in deformation gradient, rotation matrix, tension matrix displacement from reference to current configurations relative displacement from reference to nominal configurations relative displacement from nominal to current configurations translation part of each node in rotation parts of each node in and anti-symmetric matrices formed by three components in and local degrees of freedom translation and rotation parts of each node in anti-symmetric matrix formed by three components in position vector of each node in reference configuration 3×3 identity matrix rotation matrix of each node local rotation matrix of each node local strain and material matrix
