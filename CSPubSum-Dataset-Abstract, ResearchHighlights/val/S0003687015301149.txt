 We used a change detection method to evaluate attentional prioritization of nutrition information that appears in the traditional “Nutrition Facts Panel” and in front-of-pack nutrition labels. Results provide compelling evidence that front-of-pack labels attract attention more readily than the Nutrition Facts Panel, even when participants are not specifically tasked with searching for nutrition information. Further, color-coding the relative nutritional value of key nutrients within the front-of-pack label resulted in increased attentional prioritization of nutrition information, but coding using facial icons did not significantly increase attention to the label. Finally, the general pattern of attentional prioritization across front-of-pack designs was consistent across a diverse sample of participants. Our results indicate that color-coded, front-of-pack nutrition labels increase attention to the nutrition information of packaged food, a finding that has implications for current policy discussions regarding labeling change.

@highlight We used a change detection method to track the deployment of attention.
@highlight Participants were not given a nutrition-relevant goal.
@highlight Front of pack labels were attended much more rapidly than the nutrition facts panel.
@highlight Color coding nutrient values in front of pack labels increased attentional prioritization.
@highlight Results support the use of color coded front of pack nutrition labels.
