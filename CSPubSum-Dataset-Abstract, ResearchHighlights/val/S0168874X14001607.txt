 The higher-order gradient plasticity theory is successful in explaining the size effects encountered at the micron and submicron length scale. Due to the incorporation of spatial gradients of one or more internal variables in these theories and the associated non-classical boundary conditions, special types of elements in the finite element method maybe necessary. This makes the numerical implementation of this higher-order theory not straightforward. In this paper, a robust but straightforward numerical implementation of higher-order gradient-dependent plasticity theories is presented. The novelty of this paper is in  the application of the meshless methods, particularly the moving weighted least square method, combined with the finite element method for the numerical computation of plastic strain gradients, and  the numerical implementation of different types of higher-order microscopic boundary conditions at internal/external surfaces, interfaces, and moving elasticâ€“plastic boundaries. The proposed numerical implementation algorithms can be easily adapted in the implementation of any form of higher-order gradient-dependent constitutive models. Examples of applying the current numerical approach is demonstrated for capturing mesh-objective shear band formation and size effect and boundary layer formation in thin films on elastic substrates and metal matrix composites with embedded elastic inclusions through the consideration of stiff, intermediate, and soft interfaces.
