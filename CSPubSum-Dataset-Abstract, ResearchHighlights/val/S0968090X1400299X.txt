 This study investigates the impact of using a concept map-based ‘mashup’ (www.accessadvisr.net) to provide volunteered (i.e. user contributed) ease of access information to travellers with limited mobility. A scenario-based user trial, centred around journey planning, was undertaken with 20 participants, divided equally between  those who have physical restrictions on their mobility, due to disability, illness or injury, and  those with practical mobility constraints due to being parents with young children who have to use a child’s pushchair when using public transport. Both user groups found the concept useful, but its potential impact was less for the pushchair user group. There were mixed views in relation to the ability of the mashup to convey the trustworthiness, credibility and reliability of information necessary for journey planning. The study identified a number of key information-related user requirements which help enable effective design of user contributed web-based resources for travellers with mobility-related issues.

@highlight Investigated use of a map-based mashup incorporating volunteered ease of access data.
@highlight Information Quality and Cognitive Authority were the theoretical frameworks used.
@highlight Both pushchair users and disabled travellers found the concept useful.
@highlight There were potential issues in relation to trust in the information.
@highlight A set of information-related user requirements was developed.
