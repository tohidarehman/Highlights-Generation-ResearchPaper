 A study was undertaken to investigate the kinematics of older users of passenger vehicles during ingress/egress and to seek correlations between their movement and comfort rating assigned by the subjects to the ease of vehicle ingress and egress. A principal component analysis was performed on the subjectsâ€™ kinematics to identify the underlying modes of movement employed by the subjects. It was found that a small number of modes could describe the movements of all the subjects across all of the vehicles. Within the subspace defined by the modal vectors, shapes were found which correlated to the comfort rating for ease of ingress and egress which the subjects had assigned to each of the cars. Knowledge of these shapes which correspond to good and poor ingress and egress will be useful to the designers of interiors and exteriors of passenger vehicles for the older person. It is recommended that vehicle designs for the older person should attempt to avoid body positions which require excessive ankle articulation and lumbar flexion/extension during ingress and egress.

@highlight The motion during ingress/egress is decomposed into multi-joint constituent modes.
@highlight The modes combine to form shapes associated with ingress/egress.
@highlight Shapes maximise correlation to ease of ingress/egress.
@highlight Knowledge of comfort shapes are instructive for interior vehicle design.
