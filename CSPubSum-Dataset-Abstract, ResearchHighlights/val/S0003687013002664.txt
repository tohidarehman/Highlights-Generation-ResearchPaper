 The present study brings together for the first time the techniques of hierarchical task analysis (HTA), human error identification (HEI), and business process management (BPM) to select practices that can eliminate or reduce potential errors in a surgical setting. We applied the above approaches to the improvement of the patient positioning process for lumbar spine surgery referred to as ‘direct lateral interbody fusion’ (DLIF). Observations were conducted to gain knowledge on current DLIF positioning practices, and an HTA was constructed. Potential errors associated with the practices specific to DLIF patient positioning were identified. Based on literature review and expert views alternative practices are proposed aimed at improving the DLIF patient positioning process. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use BPM in association with HEI/HTA for the purpose of improving the performance and safety of a surgical process – with promising results.

@highlight The paper integrates HTA/EHI with business process management.
@highlight Our approach identifies potential errors and selects alternative practices.
@highlight We use patient positioning for spinal surgery as illustrative case.
@highlight Observation was conduct to gain knowledge on current practices.
@highlight Our approach is useful for novice and professional surgeons.
