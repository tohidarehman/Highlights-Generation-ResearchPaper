 In this paper, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) based variable structure control (VSC) with guaranteed stability for multivariable systems is presented. It is aimed at obtaining an improved performance of nonlinear multivariable systems. The main contribution of this work is firstly developing a generic matrix formulation of the FLC-VSC algorithm for nonlinear multivariable systems, with a special attention to non-zero final state. Secondly, ensuring the global stability of the controlled system. The multivariable nonlinear system is represented by T-S fuzzy model. The identification of the T-S model parameters has been improved using the well known weighting parameters approach to optimize local and global approximation and modeling capability of T-S fuzzy model. The main problem encountered is that T-S identification method cannot be applied when the membership functions (MFs) are overlapped by pairs. This in turn restricts the application of the T-S method because this type of membership function has been widely used in control applications. In order to overcome the chattering problem a switching function is added as an additional fuzzy variable and will be introduced in the premise part of the fuzzy rules together with the state variables. A two-link robot system and a mixing thermal system are chosen to evaluate the robustness, effectiveness, accuracy and remarkable performance of proposed FLC-VSC method.
