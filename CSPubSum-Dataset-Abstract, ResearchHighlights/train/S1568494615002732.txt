 Human skin detection is an essential step in most human detection applications, such as face detection. The performance of any skin detection system depends on assessment of two components: feature extraction and detection method. Skin color is a robust cue used for human skin detection. However, the performance of color-based detection methods is constrained by the overlapping color spaces of skin and non-skin pixels. To increase the accuracy of skin detection, texture features can be exploited as additional cues. In this paper, we propose a hybrid skin detection method based on YIQ color space and the statistical features of skin. A Multilayer Perceptron artificial neural network, which is a universal classifier, is combined with the k-means clustering method to accurately detect skin. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy with an F 1-measure of 87.82% based on images from the ECU database.

@highlight The proposed method is a hybrid method that combines the neural networks and k-means.
@highlight Modelling skin with different color-texture descriptors was investigated. High accuracy of F1=87.82% can be achieved based on images from the ECU database.
@highlight Study showed that YIQ color space gives the highest separability in skin detection.
