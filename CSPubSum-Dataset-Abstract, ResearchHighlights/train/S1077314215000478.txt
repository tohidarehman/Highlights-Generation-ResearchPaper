 Given a general affine camera, we study the problem of finding the closest metric affine camera, where the latter is one of the orthographic, weak-perspective and paraperspective projection models. This problem typically arises in stratified Structure-from-Motion methods such as factorization-based methods. For each type of metric affine camera, we give a closed-form solution and its implementation through an algebraic procedure. Using our algebraic procedure, we can then provide a complete analysis of the problem’s generic ambiguity space. This also gives the means to generate the other solutions if any.
