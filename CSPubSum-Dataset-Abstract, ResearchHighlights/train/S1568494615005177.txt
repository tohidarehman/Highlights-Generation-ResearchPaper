 With the advance of technology over the years, computer numerical control (CNC) has been utilized in end milling operations in many industries such as the automotive and aerospace industry. As a result, the need for end milling operations has increased, and the enhancement of CNC end milling technology has also become an issue for automation industry. There have been a considerable number of researches on the capability of CNC machines to detect the tool condition. A traditional tool detection system lacks the ability of self-learning. Once the decision-making system has been built, it cannot be modified. If error detection occurs during the detection process, the system cannot be adjusted. To overcome these shortcomings, a probabilistic neural network (PNN) approach for decision-making analysis of a tool breakage detection system is proposed in this study. The fast learning characteristic of a PNN is utilized to develop a real-time high accurate self-learning tool breakage detection system. Once an error occurs during the machining process, the new error data set is sent back to the PNN decision-making model to re-train the network structure, and a new self-learning tool breakage detection system is reconstructed. Through a self-learning process, the result shows the system can 100% monitor the tool condition. The detection capability of this adjustable tool detection system is enhanced as sampling data increases and eventually the goal of a smart CNC machine is achieved.
