 We discuss an on-line tool that facilitates access to the large collection of climate impacts on crop yields produced by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project. This collection comprises the output of seven crop models which were run on a global grid using climate data from five different general circulation models under the current set of representative pathways. The output of this modeling endeavor consists of more than 36,000 publicly available global grids at a spatial resolution of one half degree. We offer flexible ways to aggregate these data while reducing the technical barriers implied by learning new download platforms and specialized formats. The tool is accessed trough any standard web browser without any special bandwidth requirement. A tool for aggregating outputs from the AgMIP's Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison Project (GGCMI) is freely available at the GEOSHARE website () using any standard Internet browser. All the programs – a java graphical user interface (GUI) and a set of R functions – can be freely downloaded and reused. The tool is free under a GNU General Public License (www.gnu.org) agreement. Documentation and support for users include a User's Manual, Included as an Appendix for the reviewers convenience. as well as a set of default regional maps and weighting schemes.
