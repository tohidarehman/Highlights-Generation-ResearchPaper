 In this paper, a local approach for 3D object recognition is presented. It is based on the topological invariants provided by the critical points of the 3D object. The critical points and the links between them are represented by a set of size functions obtained after splitting the 3D object into portions. A suitable similarity measure is used to compare the sets of size functions associated with the 3D objects. In order to validate our approach's recognition performance, we used different collections of 3D objects. The obtained scores are favourably comparable to the related work.

@highlight The 3D object is split into 18 portions according to its principal axes.
@highlight Each portion is represented by a size function.
@highlight A well suited similarity measure is used to compare between the 3D objects.
