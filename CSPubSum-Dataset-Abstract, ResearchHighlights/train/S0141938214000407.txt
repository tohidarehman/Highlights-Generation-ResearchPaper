 This research investigated whether carrying red-colored products enhances female sexual attractiveness. In the first experiment, male participants were instructed to observe women carrying laptops in different colors (black, silver, red, or blue). The results indicated that the women who carried red laptops were perceived to possess a significantly higher level of attractiveness and sex appeal than those who carried laptops in other colors; however, the red laptop did not affect men’s perceptions of the assertiveness and health level of the women. In the second experiment, the initial experiment was repeated but female participants observed the women; laptop color did not influence how the participants perceived the women’s attractiveness, sex appeal, assertiveness, and level of health. In other words, women carrying products in red only affected how men, but not women, perceived them; thus, women using red products are more attractive and sexually appealing to men.
