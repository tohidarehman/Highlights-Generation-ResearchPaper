 This paper proposes a framework based on the Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence (DSTE), Possibility Theory (PT) and Fuzzy Random Variables (FRVs) to represent expert knowledge and propagate uncertainty through models. An example of application is given with reference to a check valve of a turbo-pump lubricating system in a Nuclear Power Plant, which is degrading due to mechanical fatigue and undergoes condition-based maintenance interventions. The component degradation-failure model used to evaluate the performance of the maintenance policy contains parameters subject to epistemic uncertainty. vector of the O output variables link between the vector of the input uncertain variables and that of the output variables input uncertain variables CDF of Y Vector of the parameters of the CDF of variable Y Generic interval provided by the expert for parameter θ Generic confidence level associated to A i-th interval provided by the expert for the p-th parameter of the j-th input variable Y Confidence level associated to p-th parameter of the j-th random variable Generic uncertain parameter Generic value of θ Necessity measure associated to the set A Possibility measure associated to the set A Possibility function of parameter θ sample a vector for variable Y made of N uniform random numbers in [0,1[ Random interval of Y corresponding to the random number , using the -cut ... –cut of θ Smallest value of the Z component of g, within the intervals 1,2 Largest value of the Z component of g, within the intervals 1,2 Plausibility measure of set A Belief measure of set A

@highlight We know the stochastic model of the degradation process affecting a component.
@highlight Its parameters are poorly known, and only via expert judgment.
@highlight We use possibility distributions to represent the information retrieved.
@highlight We develop a method based on Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence and Fuzzy Random Variables to propagate the uncertainty.
@highlight The method provides the plausibility and belief distributions of these indicators.
