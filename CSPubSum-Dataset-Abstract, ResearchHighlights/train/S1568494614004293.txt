 In this paper, we address the problem of localizing sensor nodes in a static network, given that the positions of a few of them (denoted as “beacons“) are a priori known. We refer to this problem as “auto-localization.” Three localization techniques are considered: the two-stage maximum-likelihood (TSML) method; the plane intersection (PI) method; and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. While the first two techniques come from the communication-theoretic “world,” the last one comes from the soft computing “world.” The performance of the considered localization techniques is investigated, in a comparative way, taking into account (i) the number of beacons and (ii) the distances between beacons and nodes. Since our simulation results show that a PSO-based approach allows obtaining more accurate position estimates, in the second part of the paper we focus on this technique proposing a novel hybrid version of the PSO algorithm with improved performance. In particular, we investigate, for various population sizes, the number of iterations which are needed to achieve a given error tolerance. According to our simulation results, the hybrid PSO algorithm guarantees faster convergence at a reduced computational complexity, making it attractive for dynamic localization. In more general terms, our results show that the application of soft computing techniques to communication-theoretic problems leads to interesting research perspectives.
