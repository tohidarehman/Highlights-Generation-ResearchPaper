 The aircraft maintenance routing problem is one of the most studied problems in the airline industry. Most of the studies focus on finding a unique rotation that will be repeated by each aircraft in the fleet with a certain lag. In practice, using a single rotation for the entire fleet is not applicable due to stochasticity and operational considerations in the airline industry. In this study, our aim is to develop a fast responsive methodology which provides maintenance feasible routes for each aircraft in the fleet over a weekly planning horizon with the objective of maximizing utilization of the total remaining flying time of fleet. For this purpose, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model by modifying the connection network representation. The proposed model is solved by using branch-and-bound under different priority settings for variables to branch on. A heuristic method based on compressed annealing is applied to the same problem and a comparison of exact and heuristic methods are provided. The model and the heuristic method are extended to incorporate maintenance capacity constraints. Additionally, a rolling horizon based procedure is proposed to update the existing routes when some of the maintenance decisions are already fixed.
