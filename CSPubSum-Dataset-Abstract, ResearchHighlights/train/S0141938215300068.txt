 This study evaluates the effect of presentation media (PC tablet versus pencil and paper) on the performance, level of visual fatigue, and subjective preference of those taking visuospatial tests. Fifty university students participated and performed three visuospatial short-term memory tests and three visuospatial ability tests by using both types of display media. The display medium substantially affected all of the measured variables (p <0.01). On average, the paper–pencil test scores of the visuospatial short-term memory tests were about 10% higher and the answer time was about 20% shorter than those of the PC tablet tests. The average paper–pencil test score of the visuospatial ability tests was about 35% higher than the average test score of the PC tablet test. The visuospatial performance was substantially decreased under the PC tablet condition compared with that under the pencil–paper condition. In addition, visual fatigue was greater when participants used the PC tablet than when they used a pencil and paper.

@highlight The display medium affects the visuospatial short-term memory performance.
@highlight The visuospatial ability of paper–pencil test was higher than the tablet PC test.
@highlight The visual fatigue of paper–pencil test was lower than tablet PC test.
