 Designing of scalable routing protocol with prolonged network lifetime for a wireless sensor network (WSN) is a challenging task. WSN consists of large number of power, communication and computational constrained inexpensive nodes. It is difficult to replace or recharge battery of a WSN node when operated in a hostile environment. Cluster based routing is one of the techniques to provide prolonged network lifetime along with scalability. This paper proposes a technique for cluster formation derived from “Grid based method”. We have also proposed a new decentralized cluster head (CH) election method based on Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands are based on Upper Bollinger Band and Lower Bollinger Band, both of these bands are extremely reactive to any change in the inputs provided to them. We have used this property of Bollinger Bands to elect CH. Simulation result shows significant improvement in the network lifetime in comparison with other decentralized and ant based algorithms.

@highlight Used “Grid Based Method” to create clusters.
@highlight Derived cluster head selection method based on Bollinger Bands (BB) that is a technical trading tool.
@highlight Simulation results shows significant improvement in the network life time that is measured using First Node Dies (FND), Half of the Nodes Alive (HNA) and Last Node Dies (LND).
@highlight Proposed algorithm is compared with seven different algorithms using three different node deployment pattern and two different positions of Sink.
