 Immense understanding of antenna designers illustrate that a general microstrip antenna demonstrate low efficiency. Various techniques have been adopted to improve the performance characteristics of microstrip antenna. This paper deals with the optimization of Sierpinski fractal antenna structure by utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and curve fitting method. The required data for optimization and fitting the curve has been obtained by varying different design parameters of the proposed antenna. Electromagnetic solver Ansoft HFSS 13.0 is used for generating the parametric data. The MATLAB curve fitting tool is referred for developing the equations which exhibits the relations between the parameters of proposed antenna design. Particle swarm optimization technique is then applied to find the optimum values of the design parameters for the bandwidth enhancement of proposed antenna. Curve fitting based optimized design represents the remarkable improvement in the bandwidth of conventional microstrip line fed Sierpinski fractal antenna for broadband applications.

@highlight Modified Sierpinski: change of existing Sierpinski shape of microstrip antenna.
@highlight Curve fitting is the graphical analysis by which the behavior between certain design parameters of the antenna can be visually and numerically analyzed.
@highlight Particle swarm optimization is the individual element called the particles form a swarm, all particles attains one initial position randomly at the start and then they fly through the genotypic space to find the optimal solution of the problem.
