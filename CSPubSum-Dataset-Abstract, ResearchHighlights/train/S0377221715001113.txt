 A network needs to be constructed by a server (construction crew) that has a constant construction speed which is incomparably slower than the serverâ€™s travel speed within the already constructed part of the network. A vertex is recovered when it becomes connected to the depot by an already constructed path. Due dates for recovery times are associated with vertices. The problem is to obtain a construction schedule that minimizes the maximum lateness of vertices, or the number of tardy vertices. We introduce these new problems, discuss their computational complexity, and present mixed-integer linear programming formulations, heuristics, a branch-and-bound algorithm, and results of computational experiments.

@highlight Two new network construction problems are introduced.
@highlight Complexity results are presented.
@highlight MILP formulations and a branch-and-bound algorithm are developed.
@highlight Novel lower bounding technique based on Steiner tree relaxations is used.
@highlight Computational experiments use random instances and real-life data.
@highlight Branch-and-bound algorithm is currently the best exact method.
