 Modeling collaboration processes is a challenging task. Existing modeling approaches are not capable of expressing the unpredictable, non-routine nature of human collaboration, which is influenced by the social context of involved collaborators. We propose a modeling approach which considers collaboration processes as the evolution of a network of collaborative documents along with a social network of collaborators. Our modeling approach, accompanied by a graphical notation and formalization, allows to capture the influence of complex social structures formed by collaborators, and therefore facilitates such activities as the discovery of socially coherent teams, social hubs, or unbiased experts. We demonstrate the applicability and expressiveness of our approach and notation, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

@highlight We propose a modeling approach and a visual modeling notation for social collaboration processes.
@highlight We consider collaboration processes as the evolution of a network of documents and people.
@highlight The visual modeling notation is a fusion of statecharts and graph query languages.
@highlight The approach is supported by a formal definition to enable automatic reasoning and verification.
@highlight We present sensitive use cases to demonstrate expressiveness and usefulness of our approach.
