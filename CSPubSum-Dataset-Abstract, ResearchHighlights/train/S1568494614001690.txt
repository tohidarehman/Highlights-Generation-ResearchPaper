 Present study deals with the adoption of newer technologies for developing nations. Most of the developing countries due to lack of resources perform techno-socio-economic analyses on the already existing models of the developed ones. Such adopted technologies may not perform effectively because of unlike socio-economic factors. Hence, it becomes important to select new technologies based on appropriate and suitable criteria with respect to a particular country. In this paper, we have demonstrated selection of optimal electronic toll collection (ETC) system for India. In this context, we have considered thirteen crucial parameters for selection of appropriate ETC system. Cost is found to be the pivotal selection criterion in India. Further, fuzzy logic based MADM (multiple attribute decision making) approach is employed for selection of optimal ETC system for India. RFID-based (radio frequency identification) ETC is found to be the most suitable alternative among all considered ETC technologies. Our results are in strong agreement with the report of apex committee, appointed by “Government of India (Ministry of Road Transport & Highways)” for implementation of ETC in India.
