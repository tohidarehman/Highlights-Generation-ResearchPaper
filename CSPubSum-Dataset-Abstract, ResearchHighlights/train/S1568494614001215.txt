 In order to enhance the performance and lifetime of any equipment, maintenance is essential. The major power system components including generators and transmission lines require periodical maintenance and in this regard, the present work details Integrated Maintenance Scheduling (IMS) for the secure operation. The IMS problem has been formulated as a complex optimization problem that affects unit commitment and economic dispatch schedules. Most of the methodologies adopt decomposition approaches for the solution of IMS. In this work, Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) has been used as a prime optimization tool as it has been proved to be an effective optimization algorithm when applied to various practical optimization problems and its implementation is simple involving less computational effort. The methodology has been tested on standard test systems and it works well while including generator contingency. Numerical results comparison indicates that this method is a promising alternative for solving IMS problem.

@highlight We propose TLBO algorithm for solving the Integrated Maintenance scheduling problem.
@highlight The proposed approach for generation and transmission maintenance scheduling is based on hourly basis.
@highlight Testing and validation is carried out in six bus and IEEE-118 bus systems.
@highlight Optimal maintenance schedules are obtained with better savings in cost when compared to other existing methods.
