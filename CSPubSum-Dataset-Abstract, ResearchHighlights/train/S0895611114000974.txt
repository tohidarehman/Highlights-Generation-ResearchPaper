 This work presents an automatic method for distortion correction and calibration of intra-operative spine X-ray images, a fundamental step for the use of this modality in computer and robotic assisted surgeries. Our method is based on a prototype calibration drum, attached to the c-arm intensifier during the intervention. The projections of its embedded fiducial beads onto the X-ray images are segmented by the proposed method, which uses its calculated centroids to undo the distortion and, afterwards, calibrate the c-arm. For the latter purpose, we propose the use of a constrained version of the well known Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm, reducing its degrees of freedom from 11 to 3. Experimental evaluation of our method is included in this work, showing that it is fast and more accurate than other existing methods. The low segmentation error level also ensures accurate calibration of the c-arm, with an expected error of 4% in the computation of its focal distance.
