 In order to take advantage of trends such as genetic-design students need to be familiar, and comfortable, with the concept of parametric computer models and how their parameters relate to physical-forms. Virtual learning software can aid in creating that understanding and help support studies at all undergraduate levels in engineering design disciplines. As an example, hydropower rotors are complex and largely rely on computational analysis of geometries for single rotor types. That problem can be significantly overcome using a parametric algorithm capable of creating an almost-infinite variety of computer models. Therefore, this paper investigates the shared parametric properties of common crossflow hydropower rotor geometries, resulting in a generic model that is then used to illustrate application in real-time interactive virtual learning software capable of producing accurate stereoscopic images and stereolithography files for 3D printing, as well as linking to constructive solid geometry software for slower, but more detailed, analysis. A pilot survey of student attitudes to the virtual learning prototype and resulting geometries is then discussed, illustrating the potential for 3D graphics as an effective addition to virtual learning of parametric design methods, and giving initial direction for future work.
