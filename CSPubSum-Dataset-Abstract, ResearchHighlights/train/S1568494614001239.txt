 In this paper, an adaptive hybrid control system (AHCS) based on the computed torque control for permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) servo drive is proposed. The proposed AHCS incorporating an auxiliary controller based on the sliding-mode, a recurrent radial basis function network (RBFN)-based self-evolving fuzzy-neural-network (RRSEFNN) controller and a robust controller. The RRSEFNN combines the merits of the self-evolving fuzzy-neural-network, recurrent-neural-network and RBFN. Moreover, it performs the structure and parameter-learning concurrently. Furthermore, to relax the requirement of the lumped uncertainty, an adaptive RRSEFNN uncertainty estimator is used to adaptively estimate the non-linear uncertainties online, yielding a controller that tolerate a wider range of uncertainties. Additionally, a robust controller is proposed to confront the uncertainties including approximation error, optimal parameter vector and higher order term in Taylor series. The online adaptive control laws are derived based on the Lyapunov stability analysis, so that the stability of the AHCS can be guaranteed. A computer simulation and an experimental system are developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed AHCS. All control algorithms are implemented in a TMS320C31 DSP-based control computer. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the AHCS grants robust performance and precise dynamic response regardless of load disturbances and PMSM uncertainties.
