 3D stacked technology has emerged as an effective mechanism to overcome physical limits and communication delays found in 2D integration. However, 3D technology also presents several drawbacks that prevent its smooth application. Two of the major concerns are heat reduction and power density distribution. In our work, we propose a novel 3D thermal-aware floorplanner that includes:  an effective thermal-aware process with three different evolutionary algorithms that aim to solve the soft computing problem of optimizing the placement of functional units and through silicon vias, as well as the smooth inclusion of active cooling systems and new design strategies,  an approximated thermal model inside the optimization loop,  an optimizer for active cooling (liquid channels), and  a novel technique based on air channel placement designed to isolate thermal domains have been also proposed. The experimental work is conducted for a realistic many-core single-chip architecture based on the Niagara design. Results show promising improvements of the thermal and reliability metrics, and also show optimal scaling capabilities to target future-trend many-core systems. air channel dynamic voltage and frequency scaling functional unit integrated circuit liquid channels multi-objective evolutionary algorithm multi-objective floorplanning algorithm printed circuit board resistanceâ€“capacitance through silicon via
