 We give an axiomatization of the Aumann–Shapley cost-sharing method in the discrete case by means of monotonicity and no merging or splitting . Monotonicity has not yet been employed to characterize this method in such a case, by contrast with the case in which goods are perfectly divisible, and Young (1985b) characterize the Aumann–Shapley price mechanism.
