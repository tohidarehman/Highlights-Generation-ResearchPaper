 This study examines motives for virtually endorsing others on social media, focusing on the Facebook “like” function. Motives are studied in terms of uses and gratifications, Theory of Reasoned Action, and personality and technology factors. Data from an online survey of 213 respondents were examined using factor- and hierarchical-regression analyses. Findings showed enjoyment and interpersonal relationship as most salient motives. Two types of user profiles emerged. Those with higher self-esteem, more diligence, more emotional stability, and less subjective norm clicked “like” to express enjoyment. Those with lower self-esteem, less diligence, less emotional stability, and higher subjective norm clicked “like” for pleasing others.
