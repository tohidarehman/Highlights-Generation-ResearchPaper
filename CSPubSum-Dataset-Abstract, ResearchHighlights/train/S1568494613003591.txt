 Feedback active noise control has been used for tonal noise only and it is impractical for broadband noise. In this paper, it has been proposed that the feedback ANC algorithm can be applied to a broadband noise if the noise characteristic is chaotic in nature. Chaotic noise is neither tonal nor random; it is broadband and nonlinearly predictable. It is generated from dynamic sources such as fans, airfoils, etc. Therefore, a nonlinear controller using a functional link artificial neural network is proposed in a feedback configuration to control chaotic noise. A series of synthetic chaotic noise is generated for performance evaluation of the algorithm. It is shown that the proposed nonlinear controller is capable to control the broadband chaotic noise using feedback ANC which uses only one microphone whereas the conventional filtered-X least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm is incapable for controlling this type of noise.
