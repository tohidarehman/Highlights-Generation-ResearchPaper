 In this paper we investigate the problem of interpolating a B-spline curve network, in order to create a surface satisfying such a constraint and defined by blending functions spanning the space of bivariate quadratic splines on criss–cross triangulations. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the surface, providing a constructive algorithm for its generation. We also present numerical and graphical results and comparisons with other methods.
