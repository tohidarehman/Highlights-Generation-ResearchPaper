 Automated phenotype identification plays a critical role in cohort selection and bioinformatics data mining. Natural Language Processing (NLP)-informed classification techniques can robustly identify phenotypes in unstructured medical notes. In this paper, we systematically assess the effect of naive, lexically normalized, and semantic feature spaces on classifier performance for obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CAD), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. We train support vector machines (SVMs) using individual feature spaces as well as combinations of these feature spaces on two small training corpora (730 and 790 documents) and a combined (1520 documents) training corpus. We assess the importance of feature spaces and training data size on SVM model performance. We show that inclusion of semantically-informed features does not statistically improve performance for these models. The addition of training data has weak effects of mixed statistical significance across disease classes suggesting larger corpora are not necessary to achieve relatively high performance with these models.

@highlight Systematic assessment of common machine learning methods on document phenotype classification.
@highlight Five diseases studied: Obesity, CAD, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes.
@highlight Statistical testing of model performance using approximate randomization techniques.
@highlight As expected, semantic features (UMLS-CUI) present in most top performing models.
@highlight Unexpectedly, many models without semantic features not statistically significantly different from top performing model in each disease.
