 This note studies the relationships between different aspects of agentâ€™s preferences toward risk. We show that, under the assumptions of non-satiation and bounded marginal utility, prudence implies risk aversion (imprudence implies risk loving) and that temperance implies prudence (intemperance implies imprudence). The implications of these results for comparing risks in the cases of increase in risk, increase in downside risk and increase in outer risk are discussed.
