 Objective To report on the results of a review concerning the use of mobile phones for health with older adults. Methods PubMed and CINAHL were searched for articles using “older adults” and “mobile phones” along with related terms and synonyms between 1965 and June 2012. Identified articles were filtered by the following inclusion criteria: original research project utilizing a mobile phone as an intervention, involve/target adults 60years of age or older, and have an aim emphasizing the mobile phone’s use in health. Results Twenty-one different articles were found and categorized into ten different clinical domains, including diabetes, activities of daily life, and dementia care, among others. The largest group of articles focused on diabetes care (4 articles), followed by COPD (3 articles), Alzheimer’s/dementia Care (3 articles) and osteoarthritis (3 articles). Areas of interest studied included feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. While there were many different clinical domains, the majority of studies were pilot studies that needed more work to establish a stronger base of evidence. Conclusions Current work in using mobile phones for older adult use are spread across a variety of clinical domains. While this work is promising, current studies are generally smaller feasibility studies, and thus future work is needed to establish more generalizable, stronger base of evidence for effectiveness of these interventions.

@highlight We review the use of mobile phones for health applied to older adults.
@highlight The field emerging field contains many feasibility studies with smaller samples.
@highlight A variety of clinical domains are appropriate for mobile phone interventions.
@highlight Future work should address generalizability and establish a stronger evidence base.
