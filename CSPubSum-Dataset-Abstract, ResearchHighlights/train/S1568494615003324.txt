 This paper deals with the development of effective techniques to automatically obtain the optimum management of petroleum fields aiming to increase the oil production during a given concession period of exploration. The optimization formulations of such a problem turn out to be highly multimodal, and may involve constraints. In this paper, we develop a robust particle swarm algorithm coupled with a novel adaptive constraint-handling technique to search for the global optimum of these formulations. However, this is a population-based method, which therefore requires a high number of evaluations of an objective function. Since the performance evaluation of a given management scheme requires a computationally expensive high-fidelity simulation, it is not practicable to use it directly to guide the search. In order to overcome this drawback, a Kriging surrogate model is used, which is trained offline via evaluations of a High-Fidelity simulator on a number of sample points. The optimizer then seeks the optimum of the surrogate model.
