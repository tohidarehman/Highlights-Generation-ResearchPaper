 In this paper, we conducted a series of face-to-face interviews with 17 participants from 11 SA government entities, with the aim of validating whether existing processes and strategic direction were sufficient to satisfactorily achieve the implementation of an ISMS and classification of data for the respective SA government entities. Based on our interviews and review of ISMS associated reviews conducted within other Australian State and Territory jurisdictions, we identify key areas that the SA Government may need to consider as part of the progressive roll-out of the other phases of ISMF version 3 implementation up and to June 2017.
