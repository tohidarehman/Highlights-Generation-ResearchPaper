 We consider the problem of calibrating pricing models based on the binomial tree method to market data in a network of auctions where agents are supposed to maximize a given utility function. The calibration is carried out using the minimum entropy principle to find a probability distribution that minimizes a weighted misfit between predicted and observed data. Numerical results from calibrating the mid prices from the bid–ask pairs of the buyer and seller to Taobao data demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in the case of pricing goods in a sequential auction. Further numerical test cases have been presented and have shown promising results. This work can equip those engaged in electronic trading with computational tools to improve their decision-making process in an uncertain environment.
