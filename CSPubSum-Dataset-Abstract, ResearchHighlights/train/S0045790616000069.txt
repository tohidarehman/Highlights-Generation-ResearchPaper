 ï»¿In this paper, the performance of a turbo coded, triply-Polarized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) aided Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is investigated for Stanford University Interim (SUI) and Long-term Evolution (LTE) channel model specifications. The minimum mean square error algorithm based on ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) Multi-user detection (MUD) technique is implemented at each mobile station for diminishing the effects of multi-stream interference (MSI). We observe from the simulation results that a better bit error rate(BER) performance with less signal to noise ratio (SNR), is exhibited by our considered coded system in comparison with an un-coded system. The simulation results reveal that the MIMOâ€“CDMA system with triply-Polarized antenna structure requires a higher SNR than a uni-Polarized antenna system for achievement of the same BER. However, it provides the advantage of replacement of three uni-polarized antennas by a single triply-Polarized antenna thereby achieves a higher data rate with reduced size of MS.
