 There is a long standing, but thin, stream of experimental behavioural research into understanding how modellers within operational research (OR) behave when constructing models, and how individuals use such models to make decisions. Such research aims to better understand the modelling process, using empirical studies to construct a body of knowledge. Drawing upon this research, and experimental behavioural research in associated research areas, this paper aims to summarise the current body of knowledge. It suggests that we have some experimentally generated findings concerning the construction of models, model usage, the impact of model visualisation, and the effect (or lack thereof) of cognitive style on decision quality. The paper also considers how experiments have been operationalised, and particularly the problem of the dependent variable in such research (that is, what beneficial outputs can be measured in an experiment). It concludes with a consideration of what we might come to know through future experimental behavioural research, suggesting a more inclusive approach to experimental design.

@highlight A selective review of findings from research experiments in behavioural OR is presented.
@highlight This is used to determine current knowledge about the creation and use of models.
@highlight Methods for future experiments are suggested.
