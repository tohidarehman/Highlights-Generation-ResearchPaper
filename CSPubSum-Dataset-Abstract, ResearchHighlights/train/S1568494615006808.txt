 The objective of this paper is divided into two folds. Firstly, a new generalized improved score function has been presented in the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) environment by incorporating the idea of weighted average of the degree of hesitation between their membership functions. Secondly, an IVIFSs based method for solving the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem has been presented with completely unknown attribute weights. A ranking of the different attributes is based on the proposed generalized improved score functions and the sensitivity analysis on the ranking of the system has been done based on the decision-making parameters. An illustrative examples have been studied to show that the proposed function is more reasonable in the decision-making process than other existing functions.

@highlight Generalized improved score function has been present here.
@highlight Interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers has used for assessing preference of DM.
@highlight Shortcoming of the existing score functions is overcome.
@highlight Attributes weights corresponding to attributes are completely unknown.
@highlight Sensitivity analysis of decision maker preferences has been assessed.
