 In a complex business world, characterised by globalisation and rapid rhythms of change, understanding supply chain (SC) operation dynamics is crucial. This paper describes a logic-based approach to analysing SC operation dynamics, named SCOlog. SC operation is modelled in a declarative fashion and it is simulated following rule-based execution semantics. This approach facilitates the automated explanation of simulated SC operational behaviours and performance. The automated explanation support provided by SCOlog is found to improve the understanding of the domain for non-SCM experts. Furthermore, SCOlog allows for maintainability and reusability.

@highlight A knowledge-based framework for modelling, simulating and analysing SC operation dynamics is proposed, named SCOlog.
@highlight SCOlog can explicitly and rigorously analyse the operation dynamics of complex SC scenarios.
@highlight SC disruptions are detected and analysed, along with low SC performance.
@highlight The automated explanation support provided improves the understanding of the domain for non-SCM experts.
@highlight The solution proposed is shown to be maintainable and reusable.
