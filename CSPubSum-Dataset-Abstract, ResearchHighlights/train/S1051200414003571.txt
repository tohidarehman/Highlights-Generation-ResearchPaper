 This paper presents a tutorial review of recent advances in the field of time–frequency signal processing with focus on exploiting image feature information using pattern recognition techniques for detection and classification applications. This is achieved by  revisiting and streamlining the design of high-resolution quadratic time frequency distributions (TFDs) so as to produce adequate images,  using image enhancement techniques to improve the resolution of TFDs, and  defining new features such as flatness and entropy by extending time-domain or frequency-domain features. Comparative results indicate that the new features give better performance as compared to time-only or frequency-only features for the detection of abnormalities in newborn EEG signals. Defining high-resolution TFDs for the extraction of new features further improves performance. The findings are corroborated by new experimental results, theoretical derivations and conceptual insights.

@highlight A streamlined methodology for designing high resolution quadratic TFDs using separable, directional and adaptive kernels.
