 Beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval (QTV) has been used as a marker of repolarization lability and sympathetic activation. The aim of this study was to establish ECG sampling rate requirements for reliable QT interval variability measurement. We measured QTV in high resolution simulated (1000Hz) and real ECG (1600Hz; in the supine position during rest and during sympathetic activation upon standing), using time and frequency domain metrics as well as measures of symbolic dynamics for complexity assessment. We successively halved the sampling rate and investigated its effect on the QTV metrics. Reduction in sampling rate below 400Hz and 500Hz, respectively, resulted in a significant overestimation of QTV variability and also affected complexity measurement of QTV. QTV increased during standing compared to the supine measurement. At 100Hz, the posture related change in QTV was completely masked by the measurement noise introduced by the low sampling rate. In conclusion, ECG sampling rates of 500Hz yields a reliable QTV measurement, while sampling rates of 200Hz and below should be avoided.

@highlight Beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval on surface ECG is a marker of repolarization lability.
@highlight As QT variability is typically very small, ECG acquisition parameters are important.
@highlight QT variability can be reliability measured when the sampling rate is 500Hz or above.
