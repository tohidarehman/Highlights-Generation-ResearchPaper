 Preference rankings virtually appear in all fields of science (political sciences, behavioral sciences, machine learning, decision making and so on). The well-known social choice problem consists in trying to find a reasonable procedure to use the aggregate preferences or rankings expressed by subjects to reach a collective decision. This turns out to be equivalent to estimate the consensus (central) ranking from data and it is known to be a NP-hard problem. A useful solution has been proposed by Emond and Mason in 2002 through the Branch-and-Bound algorithm (BB) within the Kemeny and Snell axiomatic framework. As a matter of fact, BB is a time demanding procedure when the complexity of the problem becomes untractable, i.e. a large number of objects, with weak and partial rankings, in presence of a low degree of consensus. As an alternative, we propose an accurate heuristic algorithm called FAST that finds at least one of the consensus ranking solutions found by BB saving a lot of computational time. In addition, we show that the building block of FAST is an algorithm called QUICK that finds already one of the BB solutions so that it can be fruitfully considered to speed up even more the overall searching procedure if the number of objects is low. Simulation studies and applications on real data allows to show the accuracy and the computational efficiency of our proposal.
