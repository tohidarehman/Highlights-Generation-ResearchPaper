 This paper introduces a new perspective on information behavior in Web 2.0 environments, including the role of mobile access in bridging formal to informal learning. Kuhlthau’s  Information Search Process (ISP) model is identified as a theoretical basis for exploring Information Seeking attitudes and behaviors, while social learning and literacy concepts of Vygotsky , Bruner  are identified as foundations for Information Sharing. The Guided Inquiry Spaces model  is proposed as an approach to bridging the student’s informal learning world and the curriculum-based teacher’s world. Research within this framework is operationalized through a recently validated Information and Communications Technology Learning (ICTL) survey instrument measuring learners’ preferences for self-expression, sharing, and knowledge acquisition interactions in technology-pervasive environments. Stepwise refinement of ICTL produced two reliable and valid psychometric scales, Information Sharing (alpha =.77) and Information Seeking (alpha =.72). Cross-validation with an established Mobile Learning Scale  indicates that Information Sharing aligns significantly (p <.05) with Mobile Learning. Information Seeking, Information Sharing, and mobile access are presented as important, complimentary components important, complimentary components in the shift along the formal to informal learning continuum. Therefore, measures of these constructs can assist in understanding students’ preferences for 21st century learning.
