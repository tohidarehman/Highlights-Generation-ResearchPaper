 Real integration of Virtual Microscopy with the pathologist service workflow requires the design of adaptable strategies for any hospital service to interact with a set of Whole Slide Images. Nowadays, mobile devices have the actual potential of supporting an online pervasive network of specialists working together. However, such devices are still very limited. This article introduces a novel highly adaptable strategy for streaming and visualizing WSI from mobile devices. The presented approach effectively exploits and extends the granularity of the JPEG2000 standard and integrates it with different strategies to achieve a lossless, loosely-coupled, decoder and platform independent implementation, adaptable to any interaction model. The performance was evaluated by two expert pathologists interacting with a set of 20 virtual slides. The method efficiently uses the available device resources: the memory usage did not exceed a 7% of the device capacity while the decoding times were smaller than the 200ms per Region of Interest, i.e., a window of 256 256 pixels. This model is easily adaptable to other medical imaging scenarios.

@highlight The JPEG2000 standard is very suitable to access and interact with WSIs.
@highlight The decoding strategy allows a granular, independent and efficient decompression.
@highlight Index files enable a fast access to specific JPEG2000 data regardless the WSI size.
@highlight This architecture permits to adapt content to user, device and network bandwidth.
@highlight This model exploits the client resources and lightens the server loading.
