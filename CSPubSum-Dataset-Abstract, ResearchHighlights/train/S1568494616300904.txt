 Many neural network methods such as ML-RBF and BP-MLL have been used for multi-label classification. Recently, extreme learning machine (ELM) is used as the basic elements to handle multi-label classification problem because of its fast training time. Extreme learning machine based auto encoder (ELM-AE) is a novel method of neural network which can reproduce the input signal as well as auto encoder, but it can not solve the over-fitting problem in neural networks elegantly. Introducing weight uncertainty into ELM-AE, we can treat the input weights as random variables following Gaussian distribution and propose weight uncertainty ELM-AE (WuELM-AE). In this paper, a neural network named multi layer ELM-RBF for multi-label learning (ML-ELM-RBF) is proposed. It is derived from radial basis function for multi-label learning (ML-RBF) and WuELM-AE. ML-ELM-RBF firstly stacks WuELM-AE to create a deep network, and then it conducts clustering analysis on samples features of each possible class to compose the last hidden layer. ML-ELM-RBF has achieved satisfactory results on single-label and multi-label data sets. Experimental results show that WuELM-AE and ML-ELM-RBF are effective learning algorithms.
