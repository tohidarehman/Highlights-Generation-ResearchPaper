 In this paper, we measure the performance for each of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation research centers by means of a Data Envelopment Analysis model. Performance data are available for a panel covering the period 2002â€“2009. The approach is instrumentalist, in the sense of Ramalho, Ramalho,. We investigate the effects on performance of contextual variable indicators related to the intensity of partnerships and revenue generation. For this purpose, we propose a fractional nonlinear regression model and dynamic GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) estimation. We do not rule out the endogeneity of the contextual variables, cross-sectional correlation or autocorrelation within the panel. We conclude that revenue generation and previous performance scores are statistically significant and positively associated with actual performance.

@highlight We fit a fractional regression to data generated by agricultural research centers.
@highlight We use a GMM dynamic estimation process.
@highlight The model estimated allows for cross and serial correlations.
@highlight The model is robust against the endogeneity of the covariates.
@highlight Revenue generation and past performance are important factors for management control.
