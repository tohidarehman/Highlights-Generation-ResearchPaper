 In this paper, the type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) controller using the feedback error learning (FEL) strategy has been proposed for load frequency control (LFC) in the restructure power system. The original FEL strategy consists of an intelligent feedforward controller (INFC) (i.e. artificial neural network (ANN)) and the conventional feedback controller (CFC). The CFC acting as a general feedback controller to guarantee the stability of the system plays a crucial role in the transient state. The INFC is adopted in forward path to take over the control problem in the steady state. In this work, to improve the performance of the FEL strategy, the T2FLS is adopted instead of ANN in the INFC part due to its ability to model uncertainties, which may exist in the rules and measured data of sensors more effectively. The proposed FEL controller has been compared with a type-1 fuzzy logic system (T1FLS) â€“ based FEL controller and the proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method.
