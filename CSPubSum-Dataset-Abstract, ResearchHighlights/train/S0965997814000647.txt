 This paper deals with the parallel solution of the stationary obstacle problem with convectionâ€“diffusion operator. The obstacle problem can be formulated by various ways and in the present study it is formulated like a multivalued problem. Another formulation by complementary problem is also considered. Appropriate discretization schemes are considered for the numerical solution on decentralised memory machines by using parallel synchronous and asynchronous Schwarz alternating algorithms. The considered discretization schemes ensure the convergence of the parallel synchronous or asynchronous Schwarz alternating methods on one hand for the solution of the multivalued problem and on the other hand for the solution of the complementary problem. Finally the implementation of the algorithms is described and the results of parallel simulations are presented.
