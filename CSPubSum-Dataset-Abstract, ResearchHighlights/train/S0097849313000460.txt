 Recent results in geometry processing have shown that shape segmentation, comparison, and analysis can be successfully addressed through the spectral properties of the Laplaceâ€“Beltrami operator, which is involved in the harmonic equation, the Laplacian eigenproblem, the heat diffusion equation, and the definition of spectral distances, such as the bi-harmonic, commute time, and diffusion distances. In this paper, we study the discretization and the main properties of the solutions to these equations on 3D surfaces and their applications to shape analysis. Among the main factors that influence their computation, as well as the corresponding distances, we focus our attention on the choice of different Laplacian matrices, initial boundary conditions, and input shapes. These degrees of freedom motivate our choice to address this study through the executable paper, which allows the user to perform a large set of experiments and select his/her own parameters. Finally, we represent these distances in a unified way and provide a simple procedure to generate new distances on 3D shapes. Robustness of the biharmonic distance from a source (black) point, which has been computed using the linear FEM mass matrix as weight, with respect to (b) tiny and missing triangles, (c) noise, (d) holes of an irregularly sampled surface (a) with local shape artifacts.
