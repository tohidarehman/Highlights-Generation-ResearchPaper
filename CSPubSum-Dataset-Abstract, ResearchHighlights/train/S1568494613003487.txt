 This paper surveys neuro fuzzy systems (NFS) development using classification and literature review of articles for the last decade  to explore how various NFS methodologies have been developed during this period. Based on the selected journals of different NFS applications and different online database of NFS, this article surveys and classifies NFS applications into ten different categories such as student modeling system, medical system, economic system, electrical and electronics system, traffic control, image processing and feature extraction, manufacturing and system modeling, forecasting and predictions, NFS enhancements and social sciences. For each of these categories, this paper mentions a brief future outline. This review study indicates mainly three types of future development directions for NFS methodologies, domains and article types:  NFS methodologies are tending to be developed toward expertise orientation.  It is suggested that different social science methodologies could be implemented using NFS as another kind of expert methodology.  The ability to continually change and learning capability is the driving power of NFS methodologies and will be the key for future intelligent applications.
