 A hierarchical vision system, inspired by the functional architecture of the cortical motion pathway, to provide motion interpretation and to guide real-time actions in the real-world, is proposed. Such a neuromimetic architecture exploits (i) log-polar mapping for data reduction, (ii) a population of motion energy neurons to compute the optic flow, and (iii) a population of adaptive templates in the cortical domain to gain the flowâ€™s affine description. The time-to-contact and the surface orientations of points of interest in the real-world are computed by directly combining the linear description of the cortical flow. The approach is validated through quantitative tests in synthetic environments, and in real-world automotive and robotics situations.
