 We extend the conceptual model developed by Amelinckx et al.  by relating electronic reverse auction (ERA) project outcomes to ERA project satisfaction. We formulate hypotheses about the relationships among organizational and project antecedents, a set of financial, operational, and strategic ERA project outcomes, and ERA project satisfaction. We empirically test the extended model with a sample of 180 buying professionals from ERA project teams at large global companies. Our results show that operational and strategic outcomes are positively related to ERA project satisfaction, while price savings are not. We also find positive relationships between financial outcomes and project team expertise; operational outcomes and organizational commitment, cross-functional project team composition, and procedural fairness; and strategic outcomes and top management support, organizational commitment, and procedural fairness.

@highlight We also relate organizational and ERA project anteceding factors to ERA outcomes.
@highlight We empirically test the model with 180 buying professionals globally.
@highlight We find partial support for the hypothesized relationships in the model.
