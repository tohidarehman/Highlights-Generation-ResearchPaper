 Residual stresses are an integral part of the total stress acting on any component in service. It is important to determine and/or predict the magnitude, nature and direction of the residual stress to estimate the life of important engineering parts, particularly welded components. Researchers have developed many direct measuring techniques for welding residual stress. Intelligent techniques have been developed to predict residual stresses to meet the demands of advanced manufacturing planning. This research paper explores the development of Finite Element model and evolutionary fuzzy support vector regression model for the prediction of residual stress in welding. Residual stress model is developed using Finite Element Simulation. Results from Finite Element Method (FEM) model are used to train and test the developed Fuzzy Support Vector Regression model tuned with Genetic Algorithm (FSVRGA) using K-fold cross validation method. The performance of the developed model is compared with Support Vector Regression model and Fuzzy Support Vector Regression model. The proposed and developed model is superior in terms of computational speed and accuracy. Developed models are validated and reported. The developed model finds scope in setting the initial weld process parameters.
