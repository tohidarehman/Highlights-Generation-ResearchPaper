 Model verification and validation (V&V) is one of the most important activities in simulation modelling. Model validation is especially challenging for Agent-Based Simulation (ABS). Techniques that can help to improve V&V in simulation modelling are needed. This paper proposes a V&V technique called Test-Driven Simulation Modelling (TDSM) which applies techniques from Test-Driven Development in software engineering to simulation modelling. The main principle in TDSM is that a unit test for a simulation model has to be specified before the simulation model is implemented. Hence, TDSM explicitly embeds V&V in simulation modelling. We use a case study in maritime search operations to demonstrate how TDSM can be used in practice. Maritime search operations (and search operations in general) are one of the classic applications of Operational Research (OR). Hence, we can use analytical models from the vast search theory literature for unit tests in TDSM. The results show that TDSM is a useful technique in the verification and validation of simulation models, especially ABS models. This paper also shows that ABS can offer an alternative modelling approach in the analysis of maritime search operations.
