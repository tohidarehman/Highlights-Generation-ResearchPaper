 Privacy-preserving collaborative filtering is an emerging web-adaptation tool to cope with information overload problem without jeopardizing individualsâ€™ privacy. However, collaborative filtering with privacy schemes commonly suffer from scalability and sparseness as the content in the domain proliferates. Moreover, applying privacy measures causes a distortion in collected data, which in turn defects accuracy of such systems. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving collaborative filtering scheme based on bisecting k-means clustering in which we apply two preprocessing methods. The first preprocessing scheme deals with scalability problem by constructing a binary decision tree through a bisecting k-means clustering approach while the second produces clones of users by inserting pseudo-self-predictions into original user profiles to boost accuracy of scalability-enhanced structure. Sparse nature of collections are handled by transforming ratings into item features-based profiles. After analyzing our scheme with respect to privacy and supplementary costs, we perform experiments on benchmark data sets to evaluate it in terms of accuracy and online performance. Our empirical outcomes verify that combined effects of the proposed preprocessing schemes relieve scalability and augment accuracy significantly.
