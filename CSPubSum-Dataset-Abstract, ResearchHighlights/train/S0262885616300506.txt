 On the onset of the second decade of research in eye movement biometrics, the already demonstrated results strongly support the promising perspectives of the field. This paper presents a description of the research conducted in eye movement biometrics based on an extended analysis of the characteristics and results of the “BioEye 2015: Competition on Biometrics via Eye Movements.” This extended presentation can contribute to the understanding of the current level of research in eye movement biometrics, covering areas such as the previous work in the field, the procedures for the creation of a database of eye movement recordings, and the different approaches that can be used for the analysis of eye movements. Also, the presented results from BioEye 2015 competition can demonstrate the potential identification accuracy that can be achieved under easier and more difficult scenarios. Based on the provided presentation, we discuss topics related to the current status in eye movement biometrics and suggest possible directions for the future research in the field.
