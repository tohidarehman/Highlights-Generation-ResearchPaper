 Face detection is one of the most studied topics in computer vision literature, not only because of the challenging nature of face as an object, but also due to the countless applications that require the application of face detection as a first step. During the past 15years, tremendous progress has been made due to the availability of data in unconstrained capture conditions (so-called ‘in-the-wild’) through the Internet, the effort made by the community to develop publicly available benchmarks, as well as the progress in the development of robust computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we survey the recent advances in real-world face detection techniques, beginning with the seminal Viola–Jones face detector methodology. These techniques are roughly categorized into two general schemes: rigid templates, learned mainly via boosting based methods or by the application of deep neural networks, and deformable models that describe the face by its parts. Representative methods will be described in detail, along with a few additional successful methods that we briefly go through at the end. Finally, we survey the main databases used for the evaluation of face detection algorithms and recent benchmarking efforts, and discuss the future of face detection.

@highlight We present a comprehensive and survey for face detection ‘in-the-wild’.
@highlight We critically describe the advances in the three main families of algorithms.
@highlight We comment on the performance of the state-of-the-art in the current benchmarks.
@highlight We outline future research avenues on the topic and beyond.
