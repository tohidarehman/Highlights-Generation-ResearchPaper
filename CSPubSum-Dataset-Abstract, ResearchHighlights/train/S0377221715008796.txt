, by incorporating both positive and negative criteria in the model. As such, we propose a DEA model, known as pure DEA, using a directional distance function approach.

@highlight We propose a new way to handle positive and negative criteria.
@highlight Our model satisfies both unit and translation invariance.
@highlight A numerical example is provided for better understanding.
