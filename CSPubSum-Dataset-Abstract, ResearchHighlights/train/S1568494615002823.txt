 In this paper, an application of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the prediction of temperature distribution in a human brain equivalent liquid (BEL), resulting from exposure to electromagnetic radiation, is presented. In the first phase of the study, temperature distributions, resulting from different exposure conditions of electromagnetic (EM) fields, are experimentally determined. Since experimental determination of temperature distribution in each point of the BEL is time-consuming and hard to implement, ANFIS is employed to determine the distribution without new measurements. The use of ANFIS is found to be very useful in terms of the prediction of temperature distribution within the BEL after exposure to radiation. Numerical results show that the proposed method can be employed for the prediction of temperature distribution in a human BEL with high accuracy without requiring any experimental measurements.

@highlight An experimental setup is designed to investigate the effect of 900MHz electromagnetic field.
@highlight EM field strength of RF generator, antenna distances applied, exposure time and the measured depths were systematically changed, while establishing the varying conditions.
@highlight A soft computing method is firstly used in the literature to determine the temperature distribution of tissue equivalent liquid exposed to electromagnetic field.
