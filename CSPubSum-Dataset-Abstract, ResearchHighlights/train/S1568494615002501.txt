 In this paper, a Proportional Derivative (PD)-type Multi Input Single Output (MISO) damping controller is designed for Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) controller. Both local and remote signals with associated time delays are chosen as the input signal to the proposed MISO controller. The design problem is formulated as an optimization problem and a hybrid Improved Differential Evolution and Pattern Search (hIDEPS) technique is employed to optimize the controller parameters. The improvement in Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is introduced by changing two of its most important control parameters i.e. Scaling Factor F and Crossover Constant CR with an objective of achieving improved performance of the algorithm. The superiority of proposed Improved DE (IDE) over original DE and hIDEPS over IDE has also been demonstrated. To show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed design approach, simulation results are presented and compared with DE and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimized Single Input Single Output (SISO) SSSC based damping controllers for both Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) power system and multi-machine power system. It is noticed that the proposed approach provides superior damping performance compared to some approaches available in literature.
