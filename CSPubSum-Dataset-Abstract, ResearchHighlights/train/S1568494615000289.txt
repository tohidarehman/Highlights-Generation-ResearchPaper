 In wireless sensor networks a large amount of data is collected for each node. The challenge of transferring these data to a sink, because of energy constraints, requires suitable techniques such as data compression. Transform-based compression, e.g. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), are very popular in this field. These methods behave well enough if there is a correlation in data. However, especially for environmental measurements, data may not be correlated. In this work, we propose two approaches based on F-transform, a recent fuzzy approximation technique. We evaluate our approaches with Discrete Wavelet Transform on publicly available real-world data sets. The comparative study shows the capabilities of our approaches, which allow a higher data compression rate with a lower distortion, even if data are not correlated.

@highlight In WSNs data compression is a way for transferring a large amount of data to a sink.
@highlight When data are not correlated popular methods such as DWT do not perform well.
@highlight We propose two F-transform based techniques to address these issues.
@highlight Publicly available environmental data were used for a comparative study.
@highlight If compared with DWT our approaches allow higher data compression rates with lower distortions.
