 The EverVIEW Data Viewer is a cross-platform desktop application that combines and builds upon multiple open source libraries to help users to explore spatially-explicit gridded data stored in Network Common Data Form (NetCDF). Datasets are displayed across multiple side-by-side geographic or tabular displays, showing colorized overlays on an Earth globe or grid cell values, respectively. Time-series datasets can be animated to see how water surface elevation changes through time or how habitat suitability for a particular species might change over time under a given scenario. Initially targeted toward Florida's Everglades restoration planning, EverVIEW has been flexible enough to address the varied needs of large-scale planning beyond Florida, and is currently being used in biological planning efforts nationally and internationally.
