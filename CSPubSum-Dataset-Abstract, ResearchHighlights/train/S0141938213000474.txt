 Recently, much research has been performed to guarantee viewer’s safety in watching stereoscopic 3D videos. Most of them focused on individual content factors causing viewer discomfort. This paper extends the kinds of content factors, and focuses more on the composite, rather than individual, factors. To analyze them, a subjective test for discomfort is performed for four stereoscopic 3D videos. Also, all the quantitative values of the factors to be considered are extracted from the contents. The quantitative factors we consider are the amount of disparity, the frequency and amount of the disparity changes, object movement, and the color and luminance information. In addition, we also include some situational factors, such as story of the contents, situation or circumstances of a scene, and movement, position, and direction of camera. We analyze qualitatively, by comparing the subject test results and the extracted quantitative factors, as well as the situational factors, to find when and how much those factors, in combination or individually, cause viewer discomfort. We summarize, and substantially show which factors, or their combinations, strongly or weakly affect viewer discomfort.

@highlight This paper’s purpose is to find as many factors causing visual discomfort as possible.
@highlight We extracted possible factors and performed subject tests for four 3D contents.
@highlight We analyzed by comparing temporarily the test results and the extracted factors.
@highlight Frequency and abruptness of disparity change were the strongest cause of discomfort.
@highlight Other factors composite with disparity increased or decreased viewer’s discomfort.
