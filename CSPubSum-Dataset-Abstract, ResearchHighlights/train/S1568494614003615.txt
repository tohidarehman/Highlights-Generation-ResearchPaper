 The goal of this paper is to achieve optimal performance for synchronization of bilateral teleoperation systems against time delay and modeling uncertainties, in both free and contact motions. Time delay in bilateral teleoperation systems imposes a delicate tradeoff between the conflicting requirements of stability and transparency. To this reason, in this paper, population-based optimization algorithms are employed to tuning the proposed controller parameters. The performance of tuned controllers is compared with the gains obtained by Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA), Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO), Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization with continuous domain (ACOR), Self-adaptive Differential Evolution with Neighborhood Search (SaNSDE), Adaptive Differential Evolution with Optional External Archive (JADE), Differential Evolution with Ensemble of Parameters and mutation strategies (EPSDE) and Cuckoo Search (CS). Through numerical simulations, the validity of the proposed method is illustrated. It is also shown that the COA algorithm is able to solve synchronization problem with high performance in stable transparent bilateral teleoperation systems.
