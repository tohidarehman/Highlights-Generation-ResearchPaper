 This paper reports an experimental result obtained by additionally using unlabeled data together with labeled ones to improve the classification accuracy of dissimilarity-based methods, namely, dissimilarity-based classifications (DBC) . In DBC, classifiers among classes are not based on the feature measurements of individual objects, but on a suitable dissimilarity measure among the objects instead. In order to measure the dissimilarity distance between pairwise objects, an approach using the one-shot similarity (OSS)  measuring technique instead of the Euclidean distance is investigated in this paper. In DBC using OSS, the unlabeled set can be used to extend the set of prototypes as well as to compute the OSS distance. The experimental results, obtained with artificial and real-life benchmark datasets, demonstrate that designing the classifiers in the OSS dissimilarity matrices instead of expanding the set of prototypes can further improve the classification accuracy in comparison with the traditional Euclidean approach. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the proposed setting does not work with non-Euclidean data.

@highlight We study enhancing the classification accuracy of dissimilarity-based classifications (DBC).
@highlight The study is done empirically when measuring the dissimilarity with one-shot similarity (OSS).
@highlight Two DBC approaches using the Euclidean distance and the OSS distance measures are compared.
@highlight The latter, albeit not always, enhances the classification accuracy for certain kinds of data.
