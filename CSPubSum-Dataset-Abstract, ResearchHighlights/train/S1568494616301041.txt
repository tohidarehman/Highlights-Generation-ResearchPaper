 This paper presents an approach for breast cancer diagnosis in digital mammograms using wave atom transform. Wave atom is a recent member of the multi-resolution representation methods. Primarily, the mammogram images are decomposed on the basis of wave atoms, and then a special set of the biggest coefficients from wave atom transform is used as a feature vector. Two different classifiers, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors, are employed to classify mammograms. The method is tested using two different sets of images provided by MIAS and DDSM database.

@highlight This paper presents an approach for breast cancer diagnosis in digital mammograms using wave atom transform.
@highlight I examine the wave atom transform to determine which couple (scale, ratio of biggest coefficients) will give the highest classification rate.
@highlight The system uses two sets of feature matrixes obtained from two different database; MIAS and DDSM database.
@highlight These are tested with classifiers in changing ratios (10% and 90% of coefficients) for each scale.
@highlight The classification is performed using two different classifiers; Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighbors.
