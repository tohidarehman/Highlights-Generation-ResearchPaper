 Ca (or Sr)TiO3:Eu3+, M (Li+ or Na+ or K+) and CaTiO3:Pr3+, M (Li+ or Na+ or Ag+ or K+ or Gd3+ or La3+) powders were prepared by combustion synthesis method and the samples were further heated to ∼1000°C to improve the crystallinity. The structure and morphology of materials were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The morphologies of SrTiO3:Eu3+, CaTiO3:Eu3+ or CaTiO3:Pr3+ powders co-doped with other metal ions were very similar. Small and coagulated particles of nearly cubical shapes with small size distribution having smooth and regular surface were formed. Photo-luminescence spectra of CaTiO3:Pr3+ and co-doped either with Li+, Na+, K+, Ag+, La3+ or Gd3+ ions showed red emissions at 613nm due to the 1D2 3H4 transition of Pr3+. The variation of intensity of emission peak with different co-doping follows the order: K+ >Ag+ >Na+ >Li+ >La3+ >Gd3+. The characteristic emissions of CaTiO3:Eu3+ lattices had strong emission at 614 and 620nm for 5D0 7F2 with other weak transitions observed at 580, 592, 654, 705nm for 5D0 7Fn transitions where n =0, 1, 3, 4 respectively in all host lattices. Photoluminescence intensity in SrTiO3:Eu3+ is more than CaTiO3:Eu3+ lattices. A remarkable increase of photoluminescence intensity (in 5D0 7F2 transition) was observed if co-doped with Li+ ions in CaTiO3:Eu3+ and SrTiO3:Eu3+.

@highlight Ca(or Sr)TiO3:Eu3+,N+ (N=Li, Na or K) powders were prepared by combustion method.
@highlight CaTiO3:Pr3+, N+ (N=Li, Na, Ag, K, Gd or La) were synthesized by combustion method.
@highlight PL intensity of CaTiO3:Pr3+ increases when co-doping with Li, Na, Ag, K, Gd or La.
@highlight Li+co-doping results in an increase of PL intensity in Ca(or Sr)TiO3:Eu3+ powders.
