 This study presents a Web platform () for computing and analyzing the 3D fractal dimension (3DFD) from volumetric data in an efficient, visual and interactive way. The Web platform is specially designed for working with magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the brain. The program estimates the 3DFD by calculating the 3D box-counting of the entire volume of the brain, and also of its 3D skeleton. All of this is done in a graphical, fast and optimized way by using novel technologies like CUDA and WebGL. The usefulness of the Web platform presented is demonstrated by its application in a case study where an analysis and characterization of groups of 3D MR images is performed for three neurodegenerative diseases: Multiple Sclerosis, Intrauterine Growth Restriction and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Web platform that allows the users to calculate, visualize, analyze and compare the 3DFD from MRI images in the cloud.

@highlight We present 3dfd.ujaen.es, a Web platform for computing and analyzing the 3D fractal dimension (3DFD).
@highlight The first Web platform that allows the users to calculate, visualize, analyze and compare the 3DFD from 3D images (i.e. MRI).
@highlight Novel technologies are used: CUDA for high-performance computing, and interactive 3D visualization of the images with WebGL.
