 Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms represent an effective tool to improve the accuracy-interpretability trade-off of fuzzy rule-based classification systems. To this aim, a tuning process and a rule selection process can be combined to obtain a set of solutions with different trade-offs between the accuracy and the compactness of models. Nevertheless, an initial model needs to be defined, in particular the parameters that describe the partitions and the number of fuzzy sets of each variable (i.e. the granularities) must be determined. The simplest approach is to use a previously established single granularity and a uniform fuzzy partition for each variable. A better approach consists in automatically identifying from data the appropriate granularities and fuzzy partitions, since this usually leads to more accurate models. This contribution presents a fuzzy discretization approach, which is used to generate automatically promising granularities and their associated fuzzy partitions. This mechanism is integrated within a Multi-Objective Fuzzy Association Rule-Based Classification method, namely D-MOFARC, which concurrently performs a tuning and a rule selection process on an initial knowledge base. The aim is to obtain fuzzy rule-based classification systems with high classification performances, while preserving their complexity.
