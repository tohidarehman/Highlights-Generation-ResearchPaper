 In this paper, we extend the multiple traveling repairman problem by considering a limitation on the total distance that a vehicle can travel; the resulting problem is called the multiple traveling repairmen problem with distance constraints (MTRPD). In the MTRPD, a fleet of identical vehicles is dispatched to serve a set of customers. Each vehicle that starts from and ends at the depot is not allowed to travel a distance longer than a predetermined limit and each customer must be visited exactly once. The objective is to minimize the total waiting time of all customers after the vehicles leave the depot. To optimally solve the MTRPD, we propose a new exact branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, where the column generation pricing subproblem is a resource-constrained elementary shortest-path problem with cumulative costs. An ad hoc label-setting algorithm armed with bidirectional search strategy is developed to solve the pricing subproblem. Computational results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The optimal solutions to 179 out of 180 test instances are reported in this paper. Our computational results serve as benchmarks for future researchers on the problem.
