 Symmetries exist in many 3D models while efficiently finding their symmetry planes is important and useful for many related applications. This paper presents a simple and efficient view-based reflection symmetry detection method based on the viewpoint entropy features of a set of sample views of a 3D model. Before symmetry detection, we align the 3D model based on the Continuous Principal Component Analysis (CPCA) method. To avoid the high computational load resulting from a directly combinatorial matching among the sample views, we develop a fast symmetry plane detection method by first generating a candidate symmetry plane based on a matching pair of sample views and then verifying whether the number of remaining matching pairs is within a minimum number. Experimental results and two related applications demonstrate better accuracy, efficiency, robustness and versatility of our algorithm than state-of-the-art approaches.
