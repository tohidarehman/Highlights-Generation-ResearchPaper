 Social media usage in evacuations and emergency management represents a rapidly expanding field of study. Our paper thus provides quantitative insight into a serious practical problem. Within this context a behavioural approach is key. We discuss when facilitators should consider model-based interventions amid further implications for disaster communication and emergency management. We model the behaviour of individual people by deriving optimal contrarian strategies. We formulate a Bayesian algorithm which enables the optimal evacuation to be conducted sequentially under worsening conditions.

@highlight We use a behavioural approach to explore emergency evacuations using Social Media.
@highlight We provide quantitative thresholds for complex model-based intervention problems.
@highlight We model individual behaviour by deriving optimal contrarian strategies.
@highlight We provide an algorithm that enables facilitators to update the optimal network allocation online.
