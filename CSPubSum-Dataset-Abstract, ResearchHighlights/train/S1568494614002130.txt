 The development of universal grippers able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely varying shapes and surfaces is a very challenging task. Passively compliant underactuated mechanisms are one way to obtain the gripper which could accommodate to any irregular and sensitive grasping objects. The purpose of the underactuation is to use the power of one actuator to drive the open and close motion of the gripper. The fully compliant mechanism has multiple degrees of freedom and can be considered as an underactuated mechanism. This paper presents a new design of the adaptive underactuated compliant gripper with distributed compliance. The optimal topology of the gripper structure was obtained by iterative finite element method (FEM) optimization procedure. The main points of this paper are in explanation of a new sensing capability of the gripper for grasping and lifting up the gripping objects. Since the sensor stress depends on weight of the grasping object it is appropriate to establish a prediction model for estimation of the grasping object weight in relation to sensor stress. A soft computing based prediction model was developed. In this study an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used as soft computing methodology to conduct prediction of the grasping objects weight. The training and checking data for the ANFIS network were obtained by FEM simulations.
