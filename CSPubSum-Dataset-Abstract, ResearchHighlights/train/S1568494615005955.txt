 Avoiding the possibility of bankruptcy during the investment horizon is very important to multi-period portfolio management. This paper considers a multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection problem with bankruptcy control. A multi-period portfolio optimization model imposed by a bankruptcy control constraint in fuzzy environment is proposed on the basis of credibility theory. In the proposed model, a linearly recourse policy is used to reflect the influence of historical predication basis on current portfolio decision. Three optimization objectives, viz., maximizing the terminal wealth and minimizing the cumulative risk and the cumulative uncertainty of the returns of portfolios over the whole investment horizon, are taken into consideration. For solving the proposed model, a fuzzy programming approach is applied to transform it into a single objective programming model. Then, a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed for solution. Finally, an empirical example is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model and solution comparisons are also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm.
