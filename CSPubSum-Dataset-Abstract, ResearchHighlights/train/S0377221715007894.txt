 Rising feed-in from renewable energy sources decreases margins, load factors, and thereby profitability of conventional generation in several electricity markets around the world. At the same time, conventional generation is still needed to ensure security of electricity supply. Therefore, capacity markets are currently being widely discussed as a measure to ensure generation adequacy in markets such as France, Germany, and the United States (e.g., Texas), or even implemented for example in Great Britain. We develop a dynamic capacity investment model to assess the effect of different capacity market design options in three scenarios:  no capacity market,  a capacity market for new capacity only, and  a capacity market for new and existing capacity. We compare the results along the three key dimensions of electricity policyâ€”affordability, reliability, and sustainability. In a Great Britain case study we find that a capacity market increases generation adequacy. Furthermore, our results show that a capacity market can lower the total bill of generation because it can reduce lost load and the potential to exercise market power. Additionally, we find that a capacity market for new capacity only is cheaper than a capacity market for new and existing capacity because it remunerates fewer generators in the first years after its introduction.
