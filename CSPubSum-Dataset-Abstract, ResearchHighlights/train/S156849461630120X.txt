 In this paper, we studied fuzzy linear fractional differential equations (FLFDEs), under Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability as the fuzzy initial value problems . Some of the previous results on solutions of these equations are concreted. We obtained new solutions by using the fractional hyperbolic functions and their properties, in details. Finally, an application and two examples are given to illustrate our results.
