 The purpose of this study is to  assess the feasibility of predicting increases in Facebook usage frequency,  evaluate which algorithms perform best,  and determine which predictors are most important. We benchmark the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Stochastic Adaptive Boosting, Kernel Factory, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines using five times twofold cross-validation. The results indicate that it is feasible to create models with high predictive performance. The top performing algorithm was Stochastic Adaptive Boosting with a cross-validated AUC of 0.66 and accuracy of 0.74. The most important predictors include deviation from regular usage patterns, frequencies of likes of specific categories and group memberships, average photo album privacy settings, and recency of comments. Facebook and other social networks alike could use predictions of increases in usage frequency to customize its services such as pacing the rate of advertisements and friend recommendations, or adapting News Feed content altogether. The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to assess the prediction of increases in usage frequency in a social network.

@highlight We assess the feasibility of predicting increases in Facebook usage frequency.
@highlight We evaluate six classification algorithms and assess the importance of many predictors.
@highlight Stochastic Boosting performs the best with an AUC of 0.66 and accuracy of 0.74.
@highlight The top predictor is the deviation from regular usage patterns.
@highlight Facebook can use our approach to customize its service (advertisements, recommendations).
