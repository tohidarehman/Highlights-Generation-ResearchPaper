 This paper mainly focuses on the multi-sensor distributed fusion estimation problem for networked systems with time delays and packet losses. Measurements of individual sensors are transmitted to local processors over different communication channels with different random delay and packet loss rates. Several groups of Bernoulli distributed random variables are employed to depict the phenomena of different time delays and packet losses. Based on received measurements of individual sensors, local processors produce local estimates that have been developed in a new recent literature. Then local estimates are transmitted to the fusion center over a perfect connection, where a distributed fusion filter is obtained by using the well-known matrix-weighted fusion estimation algorithm in the linear minimum variance sense. The filtering error cross-covariance matrices between any two local filters are derived. The steady-state property of the proposed distributed fusion filter is analyzed. A simulation example verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm.
