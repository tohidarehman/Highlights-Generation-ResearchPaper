 Video transcoding is a legitimate operation widely used to modify video format in order to access the video content in the end-user's devices, which may have some limitations in the spatial and temporal resolutions, bit-rate and video coding standards. In many previous watermarking algorithms the embedded watermark is not able to survive video transcoding, because this operation is a combination of some aggressive attacks, especially when lower bit-rate coding is required in the target device. As a consequence of the transcoding operation, the embedded watermark may be lost. This paper proposes a robust video watermarking scheme against video transcoding performed on base-band domain. In order to obtain the watermark robustness against video transcoding, four criteria based on Human Visual System (HVS) are employed to embed a sufficiently robust watermark while preserving its imperceptibility. The quantization index modulation (QIM) algorithm is used to embed and detect the watermark in 2D-Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-DCT) domain. The watermark imperceptibility is evaluated by conventional peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM), obtaining sufficiently good visual quality. Computer simulation results show the watermark robustness against video transcoding as well as common signal processing operations and intentional attacks for video sequences.
