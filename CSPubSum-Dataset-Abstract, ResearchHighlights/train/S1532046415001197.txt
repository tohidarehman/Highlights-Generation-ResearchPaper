 De-identification, identifying and removing all protected health information (PHI) present in clinical data including electronic medical records (EMRs), is a critical step in making clinical data publicly available. The 2014 i2b2 (Center of Informatics for Integrating Biology and Bedside) clinical natural language processing (NLP) challenge sets up a track for de-identification (track 1). In this study, we propose a hybrid system based on both machine learning and rule approaches for the de-identification track. In our system, PHI instances are first identified by two (token-level and character-level) conditional random fields (CRFs) and a rule-based classifier, and then are merged by some rules. Experiments conducted on the i2b2 corpus show that our system submitted for the challenge achieves the highest micro F-scores of 94.64%, 91.24% and 91.63% under the “token”, “strict” and “relaxed” criteria respectively, which is among top-ranked systems of the 2014 i2b2 challenge. After integrating some refined localization dictionaries, our system is further improved with F-scores of 94.83%, 91.57% and 91.95% under the “token”, “strict” and “relaxed” criteria respectively.

@highlight We proposed a hybrid system to automatically de-identify electronic medical records.
@highlight PHIs are identified by token-level and character-level conditional random fields.
@highlight The character-level CRFs is used to avoid boundary errors caused by tokenization.
@highlight Our system achieves an F-score of 91.24% on 2014 i2b2 corpus, which is top-ranked.
