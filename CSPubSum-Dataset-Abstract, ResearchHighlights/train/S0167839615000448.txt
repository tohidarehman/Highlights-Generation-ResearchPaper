 The purpose of this article is the construction of a normalized basis for a quadratic condensed Powell–Sabin-12 macro-element space introduced by Alfeld et al. . The basis functions have a local support, they are nonnegative, and they form a partition of unity. and Speleers (2010a), and is based on the determination of a set of triangles that must contain a specific set of points. The proposed basis can only be constructed on triangulations with a maximal angle less than
