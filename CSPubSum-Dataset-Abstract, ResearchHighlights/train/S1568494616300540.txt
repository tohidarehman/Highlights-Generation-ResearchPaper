 Differential evolution (DE) is a simple, yet efficient, population-based global evolutionary algorithm. DE may suffer from stagnation. This study presents a DE framework with guiding archive (GAR-DE) to help DE escape from the situation of stagnation. The proposed framework constructs a guiding archive and executes stagnation detection at each iteration. Guiding archive is composed of a certain number of relatively high-quality solutions. These solutions are collected in terms of fitness as well as diversity. If a stagnated individual is detected, the proposed framework selects a solution from guiding archive to replace the base vector in mutation operator. In this way, more promising solutions are provided to guide the evolution and effectively help DE escape from the situation of stagnation. The proposed framework is applied to six original DE algorithms, as well as two advanced DE variants. Experimental results on 28 benchmark functions and 8 real-world application problems show that the proposed framework can enhance the performance of most DE algorithms studied.
