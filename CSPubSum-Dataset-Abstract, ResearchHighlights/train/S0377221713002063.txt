 This paper highlights the subject of integrated projects planning (IPP) in contemporary IS departments, and presents a multi-period, multi-project selection and assignment approach (MPPA) to assist the departments in handling continuous project-based IS requests. The MPPA features a model to optimize the selection and assignment of IS projects. In the scope of multi-project, multi-period planning, the model innovatively considers the losses due to  the accumulated postponement of a previously unselected IS request and  the expected delay of ongoing projects when inserting a new project request. The MPPA also features an event-based decisional process for cumulative selection and assignment on a multi-period basis. Due to the complex and contextual nature of data in this paper, a computerized system is implemented for aiding the execution of the model and the process. The paper reports on an industrial case for a demonstration of the proposed work. Finally the paper compares the MPPA with related work to summarize the value and role it may play in the IPP context.
