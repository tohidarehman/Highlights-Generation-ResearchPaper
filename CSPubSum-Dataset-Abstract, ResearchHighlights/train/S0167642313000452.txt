 The CancerGrid approach to software support for clinical trials is based on two principles: careful curation of semantic metadata about clinical observations, to enable subsequent data integration, and model-driven generation of trial-specific software artefacts from a trial protocol, to streamline the software development process. This paper explains the approach, presents four varied case studies, and discusses the lessons learned.
