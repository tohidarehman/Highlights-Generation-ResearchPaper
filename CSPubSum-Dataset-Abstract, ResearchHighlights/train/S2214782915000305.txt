 Background As a substantial proportion of people with suicidal thoughts does not receive treatment, the internet can be a utilized to reach more people who need support. Aims To examine maintenance of effects of online self-help for suicidal thoughts at 3-month follow-up within the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial (of which between-group 6-week post-test results have previously been reported, showing a small effect of 0.28 for suicidal thoughts in favour of the intervention group), and to investigate acceptability of the intervention through participant evaluation. Methods 236 adults with mild to moderate suicidal thoughts were randomized to the intervention (n=116) or a waitlist control group (n=120). Assessments took place at baseline, post-test (6weeks later), and follow-up (3months after post-test). This paper reports on the intervention group and follow-up assessment only. Results Effects established at 6-week post-test were generally maintained at 3-month follow-up in the intervention group. Participant evaluation revealed that a majority thought their suicidal thoughts had decreased during the study, that adherence to the intervention was below average, and that levels of satisfaction were acceptable. Limitations The control group could not serve as a comparator as they had received access to the intervention at post-test. Conclusions Effects of online self-help for suicidal thoughts can be maintained for up to three months. Participant evaluation indicated that online self-help for suicidal thoughts is acceptable, but there is also room for improvement.
