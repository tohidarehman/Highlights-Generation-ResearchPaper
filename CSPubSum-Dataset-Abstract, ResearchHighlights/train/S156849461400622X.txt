 The proposed work involves the multiobjective PSO based adaption of optimal neural network topology for the classification of multispectral satellite images. It is per pixel supervised classification using spectral bands (original feature space). This paper also presents a thorough experimental analysis to investigate the behavior of neural network classifier for given problem. Based on 1050 number of experiments, we conclude that following two critical issues needs to be addressed:  selection of most discriminative spectral bands and  determination of optimal number of nodes in hidden layer. We propose new methodology based on multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) technique to determine discriminative spectral bands and the number of hidden layer node simultaneously. The accuracy with neural network structure thus obtained is compared with that of traditional classifiers like MLC and Euclidean classifier. The performance of proposed classifier is evaluated quantitatively using Xie-Beni and β indexes. The result shows the superiority of the proposed method to the conventional one.
