 Molten steel temperature prediction is important in Ladle Furnace (LF). Most of the existing temperature models have been built on small-scale data. The accuracy and the generalization of these models cannot satisfy industrial production. Now, the large-scale data with more useful information are accumulated from the production process. However, the data are with noise. Large-scale and noise data impose strong restrictions on building a temperature model. To solve these two issues, the Bootstrap Feature Subsets Ensemble Regression Trees (BFSE-RTs) method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, low-dimensional feature subsets are constructed based on the multivariate fuzzy Taylor theorem, which saves more memory space in computers and indicates ``smaller-scale'' data sets are used. Secondly, to eliminate the noise, the bootstrap sampling approach of the independent identically distributed data is applied to the feature subsets. Bootstrap replications consist of smaller-scale and lower-dimensional samples. Thirdly, considering its simplicity, a Regression Tree (RT) is built on each bootstrap replication. Lastly, the BFSE-RTs method is used to establish a temperature model by analyzing the metallurgic process of LF. Experiments demonstrate that the BFSE-RTs outperforms other estimators, improves the accuracy and the generalization, and meets the requirements of the RMSE and the maximum error on the temperature prediction.
