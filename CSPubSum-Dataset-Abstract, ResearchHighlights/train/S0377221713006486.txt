 The bi-objective Pollution-Routing Problem is an extension of the Pollution-Routing Problem (PRP) which consists of routing a number of vehicles to serve a set of customers, and determining their speed on each route segment. The two objective functions pertaining to minimization of fuel consumption and driving time are conflicting and are thus considered separately. This paper presents an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (ALNS), combined with a speed optimization procedure, to solve the bi-objective PRP. Using the ALNS as the search engine, four a posteriori methods, namely the weighting method, the weighting method with normalization, the epsilon-constraint method and a new hybrid method (HM), are tested using a scalarization of the two objective functions. The HM combines adaptive weighting with the epsilon-constraint method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm, new sets of instances based on real geographic data are generated, and a library of bi-criteria PRP instances is compiled. Results of extensive computational experiments with the four methods are presented and compared with one another by means of the hypervolume and epsilon indicators. The results show that HM is highly effective in finding good-quality non-dominated solutions on PRP instances with 100 nodes.
