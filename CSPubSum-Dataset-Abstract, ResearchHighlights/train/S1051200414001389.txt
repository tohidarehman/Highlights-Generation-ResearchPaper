 In this paper, a low-complexity algorithm SAGE-USL is presented for 3-dimensional (3-D) localization of multiple acoustic sources in a shallow ocean with non-Gaussian ambient noise, using a vertical and a horizontal linear array of sensors. In the proposed method, noise is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. Initial estimates of the unknown parameters (source coordinates, signal waveforms and noise parameters) are obtained by known/conventional methods, and a generalized expectation maximization algorithm is used to update the initial estimates iteratively. Simulation results indicate that convergence is reached in a small number of (≤10) iterations. Initialization requires one 2-D search and one 1-D search, and the iterative updates require a sequence of 1-D searches. Therefore the computational complexity of the SAGE-USL algorithm is lower than that of conventional techniques such as 3-D MUSIC by several orders of magnitude. We also derive the Cramér–Rao Bound (CRB) for 3-D localization of multiple sources in a range-independent ocean. Simulation results are presented to show that the root-mean-square localization errors of SAGE-USL are close to the corresponding CRBs and significantly lower than those of 3-D MUSIC.
