 In this paper, we revisit the consumption–investment problem with a general discount function and a logarithmic utility function in a non-Markovian framework. The coefficients in our model, including the interest rate, appreciation rate and volatility of the stock, are assumed to be adapted stochastic processes. Following Yong (2012a,b)’s method, we study an N-person differential game. We adopt a martingale method to solve an optimization problem of each player and characterize their optimal strategies and value functions in terms of the unique solutions of BSDEs. Then by taking limit, we show that a time-consistent equilibrium consumption–investment strategy of the original problem consists of a deterministic function and the ratio of the market price of risk to the volatility, and the corresponding equilibrium value function can be characterized by the unique solution of a family of BSDEs parameterized by a time variable.
