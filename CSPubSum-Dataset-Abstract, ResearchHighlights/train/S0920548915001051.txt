 Since the human resource-intensive traditional medical care practices often lack consideration of natural human reasoning, they follow procedural knowledge as the knowledge base, and therefore, they lack precision of knowledge description. In order to reduce dependency upon human resources and quickly and accurately discern a patient's health condition, we have constructed a fuzzy blood pressure verification system, which consists of an intelligent mobile device integrated with fuzzy comparison and a fuzzy analytic hierarchical process. This personalized and humane blood pressure verification system can provide assistance for the health and safety of the elderly. In stage one, the system development involves computation of the hierarchical levels of patient's various physiological data using the fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (FAHP). In stage two, a fuzzy blood pressure verification system was constructed using the fuzzy analytic hierarchical process and high-level fuzzy Petri nets. Plotting functionality was added for the convenience of observing the blood pressure trends in patient records in the database system. Upon detection of an abnormal physiological signal from a patient, the intelligent mobile system can generate an alarm, thereby facilitating real-time home care.

@highlight The proposed system immediately generates an alarm upon detection of abnormal vital signs, building a personal blood pressure system based on HLFPN.
@highlight A fuzzy blood pressure system using an Android system on the HMI-6410S integrated biomedical-electronic platform by DMATEK has been constructed.
@highlight Bluetooth communication technology and the measuring equipment with various sensors enable the proposed system to be applied to real-time tele-home care.
@highlight The proposed system also assists the patients in being aware of their daily physiological changes, helping them keep tracking and self-managing their health conditions, and preventing any further illness.
