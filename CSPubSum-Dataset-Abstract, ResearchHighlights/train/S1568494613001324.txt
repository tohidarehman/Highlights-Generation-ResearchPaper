 In this paper, the modelling problem of nonlinear systems with dead-zone input is considered. To solve this problem, an evolving intelligent system is proposed. The uniform stability of the modelling error for the aforementioned system is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov-like analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified by simulations.
