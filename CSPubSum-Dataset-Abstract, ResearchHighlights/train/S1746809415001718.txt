 This paper presents the automatic system for computer-aided balance assessment reflecting the Berg Balance Scale. The system employs inertial sensors for the data acquisition purposes. A set of features is extracted from multiple signal representations during the examination. A multilevel Fisher's linear discriminant is used to select most suitable features for each of the BBS tasks. The feature space dimensionality reduction and the multilayer perceptron classifier training both involve expert scoring on the observed examinations. The system is verified using data acquired during the BBS scoring of 64 elderly patients. Both assessment modes: the entire examination as well as separate BBS items, are evaluated and discussed using introduced assessment metrics.

@highlight We propose a system for automatic Berg Balance Scale assessment (ABBSAS).
@highlight The system employs inertial sensors distributed over a patient's body.
@highlight A specified feature vector is determined for each of fourteen BBS items.
@highlight Sixty-four elderly patientsâ€™ BBS examinations constitute the reference database.
@highlight The ABBSAS is evaluated in details using introduced assessment metrics.
