 Forest fires can impose substantial social, environmental and economic burdens on the communities on which they impact. Well managed and timely fire suppression can demonstrably reduce the area burnt and minimise consequent losses. In order to effectively coordinate emergency vehicles for fire suppression, it is important to have an understanding of the time that elapses between vehicle dispatch and arrival at a fire. Forest fires can occur in remote locations that are not necessarily directly accessible by road. Consequently estimations of vehicular travel time may need to consider both on and off road travel. We introduce and demonstrate a novel framework for estimating travel times and determining optimal travel routes for vehicles travelling from bases to forest fires where both on and off road travel may be necessary. A grid based, cost-distance approach was utilised, where a travel time surface was computed indicating travel time from the reported fire location. Times were calculated using a discrete event simulation cellular automata (CA) model, with the CA progressing outwards from the fire location. Optimal fastest travel paths were computed by recognising chains of parentâ€“child relationships. Our results achieved comparable results to traditional network analysis techniques when considering travel along roads; however the method was also demonstrated to be effective in estimating travel times and optimal routes in complex terrain.

@highlight Forest fire suppression requires vehicles to travel both on roads and cross country.
@highlight We developed a cost distance method for estimating travel times and routes to forest fires.
@highlight Our method produced identical routes to a road network analysis for road travel.
@highlight A grid based approach was effective in finding cross country routes.
