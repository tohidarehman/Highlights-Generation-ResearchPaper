 Quantitative decision support on personnel planning is often restricted to either rostering or staffing. There exist some approaches in which aspects at the staffing level and the rostering level are treated in a sequential way. Obviously, such practice risks producing suboptimal solutions at both decision levels. These arguments justify an integrated approach towards improving the overall quality of personnel planning. This contribution constitutes  the introduction of the roster quality staffing problem and  a three-step methodology that enables assessing the appropriateness of a personnel structure for achieving high quality rosters, while relying on an existing rostering algorithm. Based on the rostering assessment result, specific modifications to the personnel structure can be suggested at the staffing level. The approach is demonstrated by means of two different hospital cases, which have it that they are subject to complex rostering constraints. Experimental results show that the three-step methodology indeed points out alternative personnel structures that better comply with the rostering requirements. The roster analysis approach and the corresponding staffing recommendations integrate personnel planning needs at operational and tactical levels.
