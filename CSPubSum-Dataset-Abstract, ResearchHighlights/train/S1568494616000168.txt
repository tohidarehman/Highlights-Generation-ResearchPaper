 A continuous sliding mode control with moving sliding surface for nonlinear systems of arbitrary order is presented in this paper. The sliding surface is moved repetitively toward the target sliding surface in order to ensure that the system trajectory is close to the actual surface during the whole control process. The parameters of sliding mode control are tuned by a fuzzy logic. The proposed procedure reduces the time when the system operates in the approaching phase during which the control performance is deteriorated since the system is more susceptible to external disturbances and model uncertainties. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated on a control of a flexible robot manipulator arm.

@highlight The paper presents an improvement of control performance of sliding mode control.
@highlight The proposed method reduces duration of the undesirable approaching phase.
@highlight The control parameters are tuned by fuzzy logic rules.
@highlight The performance improvement was confirmed by simulation study.
