 A number of mobile payment studies have been proposed in recently years. Most of the schemes are largely focused on transaction security, not on users’ privacy. In this paper, we propose an Unlinkable Anonymous Payment Scheme to provide a secure and anonymous mobile commerce environment. In the proposed protocol, a user applies an anonymous virtual credit card from a trusted service manager. The sensitive information of the applied credit card is stored in the secure elements of user’s mobile device. Our proposed protocol ensures various imperative security properties such as anonymity, unlinkability, and non-repudiation etc.
