 In this paper, we investigate the deviation of the priority weights from hesitant multiplicative preference relations (HMPRs) in group decision-making environments. As basic elements of HMPRs, hesitant multiplicative elements (HMEs) usually have different numbers of possible values. To correctly compute or compare HMEs, there are two principles to normalize them, i.e., the α-normalization and the β-normalization. Based on the α-normalization, we develop a new goal programming model to derive the priority weights from HMPRs in group decision-making environments. Based on the β-normalization, a consistent HMPR and an acceptably consistent HMPR are defined, and their desired properties are studied. A convex combination method is then developed to obtain interval weights from an acceptably consistent HMPR. This approach is further extended to group decision-making situations in which the experts evaluate their preferences as several HMPRs. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed models.
