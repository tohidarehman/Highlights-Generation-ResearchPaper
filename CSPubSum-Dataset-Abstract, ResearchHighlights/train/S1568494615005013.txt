 In this paper we propose a system that involves a Background Subtraction, BS, model implemented in a neural Self Organized Map with a Fuzzy Automatic Threshold Update that is robust to illumination changes and slight shadow problems. The system incorporates a scene analysis scheme to automatically update the Learning Rates values of the BS model considering three possible scene situations. In order to improve the identification of dynamic objects, an Optical Flow algorithm analyzes the dynamic regions detected by the BS model, whose identification was not complete because of camouflage issues, and it defines the complete object based on similar velocities and direction probabilities. These regions are then used as the input needed by a Matte algorithm that will improve the definition of the dynamic object by minimizing a cost function. Among the original contributions of this work are; an adapting fuzzy-neural segmentation model whose thresholds and learning rates are adapted automatically according to the changes in the video sequence and the automatic improvement on the segmentation results based on the Matte algorithm and Optical flow analysis. Findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces a competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art reported models by using BMC and Li databases.
