 One of the most critical barriers to widespread adoption of electric cars is the lack of charging station infrastructure. Although it is expected that a sufficient number of charging stations will be constructed eventually, due to various practical reasons they may have to be introduced gradually over time. In this paper, we formulate a multi-period optimization model based on a flow-refueling location model for strategic charging station location planning. We also propose two myopic methods and develop a case study based on the real traffic flow data of the Korean Expressway network in 2011. We discuss the performance of the three proposed methods.

@highlight We propose three methods for multi-period planning to locate electric charging stations.
@highlight We compare the three methods with the Korean Expressway data.
@highlight Excluding short/low-demand paths make problems tractable without losing coverage.
@highlight Multi-period location decisions can be significantly different from single-period decisions.
@highlight We consider five types of demand profile for additional insights.
