 After the appearance of digital broadcasting, realistic images such as 3D and high resolution broadcasting are rapidly developing and evolving. And, recent trend emphasizes not only viewing the information but also using it through the display media. To keep up with this trend, large size display manufacturers are trying to support resolution beyond the full HD, in order to display additional information and high definition broadcasting at the same time. In this paper, we present a 21:9 cinema mode resolution  function using two ICs that support full HD for Plasma Display Panels (PDPs) which is one of the largest flat display panels. In order to achieve this, we first set the master and the slave between the two ICs, and propose an efficient information exchange and computation scheme using serial communication that links the master and the slave. Furthermore, we realize the cinema function with 21:9 resolution through image quality processing and operational parameter exchange and computation in the boundary that is set between the master and the slave. Finally, the cinema mode image realized using the hardware circuit board is demonstrated.

@highlight A 21:9 cinema mode function is implemented by using two ICs that support full HD.
@highlight We propose efficient information change and computation scheme between two ICs.
@highlight This scheme has an advantage of reducing the SOC development cost.
@highlight Not only the 2560×1080 but also can be applied to the 4K×2K resolution.
