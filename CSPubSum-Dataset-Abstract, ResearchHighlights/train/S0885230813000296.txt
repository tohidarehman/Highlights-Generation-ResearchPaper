 This paper investigates advanced channel compensation techniques for the purpose of improving i-vector speaker verification performance in the presence of high intersession variability using the NIST 2008 and 2010 SRE corpora. The performance of four channel compensation techniques: (a) weighted maximum margin criterion (WMMC), (b) source-normalized WMMC (SN-WMMC), (c) weighted linear discriminant analysis (WLDA) and (d) source-normalized WLDA (SN-WLDA) have been investigated. We show that, by extracting the discriminatory information between pairs of speakers as well as capturing the source variation information in the development i-vector space, the SN-WLDA based cosine similarity scoring (CSS) i-vector system is shown to provide over 20% improvement in EER for NIST 2008 interview and microphone verification and over 10% improvement in EER for NIST 2008 telephone verification, when compared to SN-LDA based CSS i-vector system. Further, score-level fusion techniques are analyzed to combine the best channel compensation approaches, to provide over 8% improvement in DCF over the best single approach, SN-WLDA, for NIST 2008 interview/telephone enrolment-verification condition. Finally, we demonstrate that the improvements found in the context of CSS also generalize to state-of-the-art GPLDA with up to 14% relative improvement in EER for NIST SRE 2010 interview and microphone verification and over 7% relative improvement in EER for NIST SRE 2010 telephone verification.

@highlight WMMC and SN-WMMC approaches were introduced to i-vector system.
@highlight WLDA and SN-WLDA approaches were also introduced to i-vector system.
@highlight SN-WLDA shows significant improvement over baseline approach.
@highlight SN-WLDA projected GPLDA also shows improvement over standard GPLDA system.
