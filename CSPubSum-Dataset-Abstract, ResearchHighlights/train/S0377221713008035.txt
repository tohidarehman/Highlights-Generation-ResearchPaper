 In many managerial applications, situations frequently occur when a fixed cost is used in constructing the common platform of an organization, and needs to be shared by all related entities, or decision making units (DMUs). It is of vital importance to allocate such a cost across DMUs where there is competition for resources. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been successfully used in cost and resource allocation problems. Whether it is a cost or resource allocation issue, one needs to consider both the competitive and cooperative situation existing among DMUs in addition to maintaining or improving efficiency. The current paper uses the cross-efficiency concept in DEA to approach cost and resource allocation problems. Because DEA cross-efficiency uses the concept of peer appraisal, it is a very reasonable and appropriate mechanism for allocating a shared resource/cost. It is shown that our proposed iterative approach is always feasible, and ensures that all DMUs become efficient after the fixed cost is allocated as an additional input measure. The cross-efficiency DEA-based iterative method is further extended into a resource-allocation setting to achieve maximization in the aggregated output change by distributing available resources. Such allocations for fixed costs and resources are more acceptable to the players involved, because the allocation results are jointly determined by all DMUs rather than a specific one. The proposed approaches are demonstrated using an existing data set that has been applied in similar studies.
