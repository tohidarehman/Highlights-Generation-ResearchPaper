 The ubiquity of Online Social Networks (OSNs) is creating new sources for healthcare information, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical drugs. We aimed to examine the impact of a given OSN’s characteristics on the content of pharmaceutical drug discussions from that OSN. We compared the effect of four distinguishing characteristics from ten different OSNs on the content of their pharmaceutical drug discussions:  General versus Health OSN;  OSN moderation;  OSN registration requirements; and  OSNs with a question and answer format. The effects of these characteristics were measured both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that an OSN’s characteristics indeed affect the content of its discussions. Based on their information needs, healthcare providers may use our findings to pick the right OSNs or to advise patients regarding their needs. Our results may also guide the creation of new and more effective domain-specific health OSNs. Further, future researchers of online healthcare content in OSNs may find our results informative while choosing OSNs as data sources. We reported several findings about the impact of OSN characteristics on the content of pharmaceutical drug discussion, and synthesized these findings into actionable items for both healthcare providers and future researchers of healthcare discussions on OSNs. Future research on the impact of OSN characteristics could include user demographics, quality and safety of information, and efficacy of OSN usage.

@highlight Psychotherapeutic drugs dominate health OSNs, especially non-moderated health OSNs.
@highlight Genitourinary tract agents and nutritional drugs chatter dominates general OSNs.
@highlight Respiratory and hormonal drugs appear more often in OSNs that require registration.
@highlight OSNs with a question and answer format are less subjective.
@highlight Users ask more questions about gastrointestinal and metabolic drugs.
