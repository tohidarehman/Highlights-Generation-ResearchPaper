 In this paper, we construct the probability sum (PS) function and the proportional distribution rules of membership function and non-membership function of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), and give their corresponding geometric interpretations. Based on which, we present the neutrality operation and the scalar neutrality operation on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). We propose the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted neutral averaging (IFWNA) operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted neutral averaging (IFOWNA) operator. The properties of the IFWNA operator and the IFOWNA operator are investigated. The principal advantages of the proposed operators are that both the attitude of the decision makers and the interactions between different intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) are considered. Furthermore, approaches to multi-criteria decision making based on the proposed IFWNA and IFOWNA operator are given. Finally, an example is illustrated to show the feasibility and validity of the new approaches to the application of decision making.
