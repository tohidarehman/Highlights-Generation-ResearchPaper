 In this paper, the optimum cutting conditions without chatter vibrations have been determined during turning operations. Chatter vibrations are detrimental and cause poor surface properties. In this study, chatter vibration prevention has been discussed in a different way using a multi-criteria decision making approach. Regression-multi-criteria decision making hybrid models have been developed and applied to the problem of chatter vibrations. First, regression models have been used to determine the criteria weights for TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) model. Then, TOPSIS models have been developed. Three different hybrid models have been studied. The results of these three models are the same. It has been seen from the results that the number of revolutions and the workpiece hardness are the most effective parameters. The models are developed to help operators in different manufacturing environments.

@highlight MCDM study has been performed to determine optimum cutting conditions without chatter.
@highlight Different cutting, tool-working material and modal parameters have been used in the models to maximize stable cutting depth.
@highlight Hybrid decision making models have produced successful results.
