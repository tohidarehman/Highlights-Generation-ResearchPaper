 To avoid performance degradation and maintain the quality of results obtained by the case-based reasoning (CBR) systems, maintenance becomes necessary, especially for those systems designed to operate over long periods and which must handle large numbers of cases. CBR systems cannot be preserved without scanning the case base. For this reason, the latter must undergo maintenance operations. The techniques of case baseâ€™s dimension optimization is the analog of instance reduction size methodology (in the machine learning community). This study links these techniques by presenting case-based maintenance in the framework of instance based reduction, and provides: first an overview of CBM studies, second, a novel method of structuring and updating the case base and finally an application of industrial case is presented. The structuring combines a categorization algorithm with a measure of competence CM based on competence and performance criteria. Since the case base must progress over time through the addition of new cases, an auto-increment algorithm is installed in order to dynamically ensure the structuring and the quality of a case base. The proposed method was evaluated through a case base from an industrial plant. In addition, an experimental study of the competence and the performance was undertaken on reference benchmarks. This study showed that the proposed method gives better results than the best methods currently found in the literature.
