 This paper addresses the issue of activity understanding from video and its semantics-rich description. A novel approach is presented where activities are characterised and analysed at different resolutions. Semantic information is delivered according to the resolution at which the activity is observed. Furthermore, the multiresolution activity characterisation is exploited to detect abnormal activity. To achieve these system capabilities, the focus is given on context modelling by employing a soft computing-based algorithm which automatically enables the determination of the main activity zones of the observed scene by taking as input the trajectories of detected mobiles. Such areas are learnt at different resolutions (or granularities). In a second stage, learned zones are employed to extract people activities by relating mobile trajectories to the learned zones. In this way, the activity of a person can be summarised as the series of zones that the person has visited. Employing the inherent soft relation properties, the reported activities can be labelled with meaningful semantics. Depending on the granularity at which activity zones and mobile trajectories are considered, the semantic meaning of the activity shifts from broad interpretation to detailed description. Activity information at different resolutions is also employed to perform abnormal activity detection.

@highlight We present a soft computing-based approach for automatic activity extraction from video.
@highlight The proposed approach learns the activity model in an unsupervised way.
@highlight Activities are characterised and analysed at different resolutions.
@highlight Semantic information is delivered according to the resolution at which the activity is observed.
@highlight The approach detects abnormalities based on analysis of statistics of the observed activities at different resolutions.
@highlight The approach is generic and works both, indoors and outdoors.
