 This paper deals with direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) approach based on Taylor series expansion (TSE) technique for space-time code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems. It has been shown that the TSE of the presumed steering vector is a simple approach without any need for direction search. Unfortunately, the Taylor approach is more likely to converge to a local maximum, causing errors in DOA estimation. In conjunction with a genetic algorithm for selecting initial search angle, an efficient approach is presented to achieve the advantages of TSE DOA estimation with fast convergence and less computational load over iterative searching MVDR estimator. Simulation results are provided for illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
