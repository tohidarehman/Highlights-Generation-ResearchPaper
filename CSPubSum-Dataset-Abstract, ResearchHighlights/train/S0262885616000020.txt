 The emergence of large-scale human action datasets poses a challenge to efficient action labeling. Hand labeling large-scale datasets is tedious and time consuming; thus a more efficient labeling method would be beneficial. One possible solution is to make use of the knowledge of a known dataset to aid the labeling of a new dataset. To this end, we propose a new transfer learning method for cross-dataset human action recognition. Our method aims at learning generalized feature representation for effective cross-dataset classification. We propose a novel dual many-to-one encoder architecture to extract generalized features by mapping raw features from source and target datasets to the same feature space. Benefiting from the favorable property of the proposed many-to-one encoder, cross-dataset action data are encouraged to possess identical encoded features if the actions share the same class labels. Experiments on pairs of benchmark human action datasets achieved state-of-the-art accuracy, proving the efficacy of the proposed method.
