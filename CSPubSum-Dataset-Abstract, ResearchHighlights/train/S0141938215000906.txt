 GdVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ with tetragonal phase has been successfully synthesized by employing efficient irradiations. The assembly of composites with fine grains based on acoustic energy and microwave radiation requires low temperature (90Â°C) and short reaction time (60min). All the compounds exhibited red emissions and they can be sensitized through the doped Bi3+ ions. The dependence of pH changes and doping concentration on the fluorescence features has been discussed. The photoluminescence measurements show that the optical properties achieved the best results at pH=9 for GdVO4:Eu3+(5mol%), Bi3+(1mol%) or pH=7 for GdVO4:Eu3+.
