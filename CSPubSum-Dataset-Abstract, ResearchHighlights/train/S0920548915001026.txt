 This paper presents a study of the collective knowledge in information technology (IT) and the comparative analyses of innovative trends in the standardisation of the roads of knowledge in the subfields of software engineering (SE). The focus is on the amount of required innovation that will be necessary in the examples database of standardised units in IT and SE for the improvement of the information systems (IS). The goal is to determine how to obtain appropriate knowledge in IT and SE to model the excellence of IS. The contribution to the modelling of IS excellence in PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is presented.

@highlight Originality of trend lines resources planning (Pi) for IT/ICS-1=35 field: y35/ISO/2014, and y35/SRPS/2014 trend lines for development SE (ICS-2=35.060 and ICS-2=35.080) segments.
@highlight Paths of knowledge acquisition in SE fields are based on ISO.
@highlight Originality of the topic for Check(i) innovation trend KB in time dimension and PiDiCiAi methodology.
@highlight Platform of standardisation for knowledge improvement, model and products IS excellence (Ai) in PiDiCiAi.
