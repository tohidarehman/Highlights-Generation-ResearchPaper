 Interactive approaches employing cone contraction for multi-criteria mixed integer optimization are introduced. In each iteration, the decision maker (DM) is asked to give a reference point (new aspiration levels). The subsequent Pareto optimal point is the reference point projected on the set of admissible objective vectors using a suitable scalarizing function. Thereby, the procedures solve a sequence of optimization problems with integer variables. In such a process, the DM provides additional preference information via pair-wise comparisons of Pareto optimal points identified. Using such preference information and assuming a quasiconcave and non-decreasing value function of the DM we restrict the set of admissible objective vectors by excluding subsets, which cannot improve over the solutions already found. The procedures terminate if all Pareto optimal solutions have been either generated or excluded. In this case, the best Pareto point found is an optimal solution. Such convergence is expected in the special case of pure integer optimization; indeed, numerical simulation tests with multi-criteria facility location models and knapsack problems indicate reasonably fast convergence, in particular, under a linear value function. We also propose a procedure to test whether or not a solution is a supported Pareto point (optimal under some linear value function).
