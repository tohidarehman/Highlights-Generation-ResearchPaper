 Diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi) signal plays an important role in the diagnosis and analysis of respiratory diseases. However, EMGdi recordings are often contaminated by electrocardiographic (ECG) interference, which posing serious obstacle to traditional denoising approaches due to overlapped spectra of these signals. In this paper, a novel method based on wavelet transform and independent component analysis (ICA) is proposed to remove the ECG interference from noisy EMGdi signals. With the proposed method, the original independent components of contaminated EMGdi signal were first obtained with ICA. Then the ECG components contained were removed by a specially designed wavelet domain filter. After that, the purified independent components were reconstructed back to the original signal space by ICA to obtain clean EMGdi signals. Experimental results achieved on practical clinical data show that the proposed approach is better than several traditional methods include wavelet transform (WT), ICA, digital filter and adaptive filter in ECG interference removing.
