 In the area of eLearning the automation of processes from their specifications is still unfeasible. The reason may be the lack of standards and specifications to specify learning processes unambiguously. The work presented in this paper try to solve such problem with two main contributions: the creation of a OKI-OSID metamodel to specify learning processes unambiguously, and the creation of a system that creates automatically partial implementations of learning processes from the OKI-OSID metamodel. Furthermore, an implementation of the method is also provided as well as some insights about the problems found in OKI-OSID and the underspecifications these lacks produces.

@highlight A LMS-independent method to specify unambiguously learning processes.
@highlight A method that automatically generates partial implementations of learning processes.
@highlight A metamodel to define the OKI-OSID specification.
@highlight An OKI ontology to facilitate the transcriptions from specifications of processes to code.
@highlight A set of limitations to the OKI specification.
