 Typical MAC protocols for IEEE 802.11-based ad hoc networks employ a direct transmission strategy whenever the transmitter can directly reach the receiver (one-hop transmission). While such a design enjoys simplicity, it limits the number of admitted transmissions in a given neighborhood. Due to the performance anomaly of 802.11-based wireless networks, transmission with low data rates occupy the shared medium for longer periods of time. Occupying the transmission medium for a longer period of time results in less available transmission time for other nodes, which consequently reduces the number of transmitted packets during the same period of time, leading to a reduction in network throughput. To improve the overall network throughput, we present a cooperative multi-channel MAC protocol for single-hop wireless mobile ad hoc networks that attempts at computing the path with the minimum required transmission time for a given sourceâ€“destination pair (including the channel assignment along that path). The proposed protocol attempts at improving network performance by means of cooperative communications. According to our approach, if the one-hop (direct) path between communicating nodes supports low data rate (requires longer transmission time), the source selects a multi-hop path to the destination such that the total amount of required transmission time is minimized. Through simulations, we show that our proposed protocol achieves significant throughput and fairness improvement compared to the standard IEEE 802.11-based protocol.

@highlight We propose a cooperative channel assignment and packet forwarding protocol.
@highlight Our protocol reduces the transmission times for the low-data rate direct link users.
@highlight Our protocol selects multi-hop path with min transmit time even direct path exists.
@highlight Results show that our protocol notably improves network throughput over IEEE 802.11.
