 This work addresses the problem of detecting human behavioural anomalies in crowded surveillance environments. We focus in particular on the problem of detecting subtle anomalies in a behaviourally heterogeneous surveillance scene. To reach this goal we implement a novel unsupervised context-aware process. We propose and evaluate a method of utilising social context and scene context to improve behaviour analysis. We find that in a crowded scene the application of Mutual Information based social context permits the ability to prevent self-justifying groups and propagate anomalies in a social network, granting a greater anomaly detection capability. Scene context uniformly improves the detection of anomalies in both datasets. The strength of our contextual features is demonstrated by the detection of subtly abnormal behaviours, which otherwise remain indistinguishable from normal behaviour.

@highlight We propose a novel context aware anomaly detection process applied to human behaviour.
@highlight We evaluate our method upon 2 different datasets.
@highlight We utilise a novel social connections metric and a scene model as contextual information.
@highlight The use of scene contextual information improves the detection of subtle anomalies.
@highlight The use of social contextual information improves the detection of abnormal behaviour.
