 This paper presents the experimental study on a system which is an interesting crossover between a standard benchmark control problem and a smart material. The study represents the effect of stress, strain and temperature over bandwidth of antagonistic shape memory alloy (SMA) and its relative performance in influencing the stability of the system. The experiment is implicated on an underactuated open loop unstable ball and beam system, designed and developed to be driven by SMA. A proportional derivative controller cascaded with sliding mode controller (SMC) based on simplified fuzzy adaptive sliding surface is considered to study the dynamics of the system. The designed simplified fuzzy based sliding surface controller is able to balance the ball and beam system around its equilibrium state, which as a control perspective shows that performance of this controller is better than the conventional SMC. Furthermore from smart material perspective decisive results are arrived to handle the issues like stability, speed of operation and performance of antagonistic SMA.
