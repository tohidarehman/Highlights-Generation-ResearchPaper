 We examine the role of parental style versus peer influence on Generation Y’s attitudes towards online unethical activities using a survey of a matched parent–child sample. Results suggest that a protective parental style has the greatest impact on Generation Y’s online ethical attitudes, while a strict discipline style has no significant influence. Peers are more influential, but not as influential as when there is agreement between parents and their children on a specific activity. Methodologically, the research highlights the necessity to measure family dyads and assess whether or not parents and their children’s perceptions are the same.
