 In this paper we investigate the problem of finding a safe transit of a ship through areas threatened by sea mines. The aim is to provide decision-making support by a tool that can be integrated into a naval command and control system. We present a route finding algorithm which avoids regions of risk higher than a given threshold. The algorithm takes into account the technical and operational restrictions of the shipâ€™s movement. It allows to minimize the route length, the traveling time, the number of maneuvers, or other objectives. The basic idea is to embed a network in the operational area and compute a least-cost path. Instead of using a regular grid graph which strongly restricts the types of maneuvers and necessitates a path smoothing after optimization, we design a network which is especially tailored to the maneuverability of the vessel. Each path in this network represents a continuous-curvature track based on combinations of clothoids and straight line segments. The approach allows a large variety of maneuvers, hence high-quality solutions are achievable provided a sufficiently dense network.
