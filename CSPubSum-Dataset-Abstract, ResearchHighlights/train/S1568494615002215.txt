 Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, one of the swarm intelligence algorithms, has been proposed for continuous optimization, inspired intelligent behaviors of real honey bee colony. For the optimization problems having binary structured solution space, the basic ABC algorithm should be modified because its basic version is proposed for solving continuous optimization problems. In this study, an adapted version of ABC, ABC bin for short, is proposed for binary optimization. In the proposed model for solving binary optimization problems, despite the fact that artificial agents in the algorithm works on the continuous solution space, the food source position obtained by the artificial agents is converted to binary values, before the objective function specific for the problem is evaluated. The accuracy and performance of the proposed approach have been examined on well-known 15 benchmark instances of uncapacitated facility location problem, and the results obtained by ABC bin are compared with the results of continuous particle swarm optimization (CPSO), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), improved binary particle swarm optimization (IBPSO), binary artificial bee colony algorithm (binABC) and discrete artificial bee colony algorithm (DisABC). The performance of ABC bin is also analyzed under the change of control parameter values. The experimental results and comparisons show that proposed ABC bin is an alternative and simple binary optimization tool in terms of solution quality and robustness.
