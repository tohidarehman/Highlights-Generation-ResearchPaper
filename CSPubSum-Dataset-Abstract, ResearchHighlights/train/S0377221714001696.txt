 The waste disposal charging fee (WDCF) has long been adopted for stimulating major project stakeholdersâ€™ (particularly project clients and contractors) incentives to minimize solid waste and increase the recovery of wasted materials in the construction industry. However, the present WDCFs applied in many regions of China are mostly determined based on a rule of thumb. Consequently the effectiveness of implementing these WDCFs is very limited. This study aims at addressing this research gap through developing a system dynamics based model to determine an appropriate WDCF in the construction sector. The data used to test and validate the model was collected from Shenzhen of south China. By using the model established, two types of simulations were carried out. One is the base run simulation to investigate the status quo of waste generation in Shenzhen; the other is policy analysis simulation, with which an appropriate WDCF could be determined to reduce waste generation and landfilling, maximize waste recycling, and minimize the waste dumped inappropriately. The model developed can function as a tool to effectively determine an appropriate WDCF in Shenzhen. Further, it can also be used by other regions intending to stimulate construction waste minimization and recycling through implementing an optimal WDCF.

@highlight We model the construction waste disposal charging fee (WDCF) with a system dynamics approach.
@highlight Major factors and their dynamic feedback loops were analyzed with the model proposed.
@highlight An appropriate WDCF can be effectively determined by using the model, which enhances construction waste minimization.
