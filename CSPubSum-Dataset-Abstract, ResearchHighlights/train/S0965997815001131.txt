 A global sensitivity analysis and parameter adjustment of a simplified physical fire model applied to a well measured experimental example is developed in order to validate the model. The fire model is a simplified physical 2D wildland fire model with some 3D effects that takes into account the wind, the slope of the orography, the fuel load and type, the moisture content, the energy lost in the vertical direction and the radiation from the flames. The simplicity of the model and the numerical techniques proposed allow very competitive computational times. temperature (K) (T ∞ reference temperature) enthalpy fuel load kg (M 0 initial fuel load) moisture content (kg of water/kg of dry fuel) density kg heat capacity kg natural convection coefficient thermal radiation radiation intensity sr mean absorption coefficient latent heat of evaporation kg flame height (m) half-life time of combustion (s) spatial and temporal scales (m, s) dimensionless temperature dimensionless enthalpy mass fraction of solid fuel dimensionless natural convection coefficient dimensionless thermal radiation dimensionless latent heat of evaporation dimensionless temperature of water evaporation dimensionless temperature of solid fuel pyrolysis dimensionless coefficient of fuel mass variation by pyrolysis ln dimensionless wind velocity correction factor
