 A linguistic decision aiding technique for multi-criteria decision is presented. We define a relation between alternatives as multi-criteria semantic dominance (MCSD). It adopts the similar ideal of the stochastic dominance by utilizing the partial information of the decision makerâ€™s preference, which is only ordinal or partially cardinal. The MCSD rules based on three typical types of semanteme functions are introduced and proven. By using these rules, all the alternatives under consideration are divided into two mutually exclusive sets called efficient set and inefficient set. The decision maker who has such a semanteme function will never choose the alternative from the corresponding inefficient set as the optimal one. In such a way, when we analyze the linguistic decision information, the inherent fuzziness of preference can be handled and several controversial operations of the linguistic terms can be avoided. An example is also provided to illustrate the procedure of the proposed method.
