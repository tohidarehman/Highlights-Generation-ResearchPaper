 In this paper we propose a framework for tracking multiple interacting targets in a wide-area camera network consisting of both overlapping and non-overlapping cameras. Our method is motivated from observations that both individuals and groups of targets interact with each other in natural scenes. We associate each raw target trajectory (i.e., a tracklet) with a group state, which indicates if the trajectory belongs to an individual or a group. Structural Support Vector Machine (SSVM) is applied to the group states to decide if merge or split events occur in the scene. Information fusion between multiple overlapping cameras is handled using a homography-based voting scheme. The problem of tracking multiple interacting targets is then converted to a network flow problem, for which the solution can be obtained by the K-shortest paths algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on the challenging VideoWeb dataset in which a large amount of multi-person interaction activities are present. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods is also shown.
