 The theory of the isoptic curves is widely studied in the Euclidean plane (see Cie≈õlak et al., 1991 and  and the references given there). The analogous question was investigated by the authors in the hyperbolic and elliptic planes (see Csima and , 2012, submitted for publication), but in the higher dimensional spaces there are only few results in this topic. we gave a natural extension of the notion of the isoptic curves to the n-dimensional Euclidean space which is called isoptic hypersurface. Now we develope an algorithm to determine the isoptic surface of a 3-dimensional polyhedron We will determine the isoptic surfaces for Platonic solids and for some semi-regular Archimedean polytopes and visualize them with Wolfram Mathematica .

@highlight Isoptic curves are generalized to isoptic surfaces.
@highlight Implicit equations of isoptic surfaces for polytopes are given algorithmically.
@highlight Spherical geometry is useful to determine solid angles.
