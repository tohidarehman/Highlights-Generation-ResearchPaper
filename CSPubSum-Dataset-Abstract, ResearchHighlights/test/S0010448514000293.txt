 In this paper the authors present research into an integrative computational design methodology for the design and robotic implementation of fibre-composite systems. The proposed approach is based on the concurrent and reciprocal integration of biological analysis, material design, structural analysis, and the constraints of robotic filament winding within a coherent computational design process. A particular focus is set on the development of specific tools and solvers for the generation, simulation and optimization of the fibre layout and their feedback into the global morphology of the system. The methodology demonstrates how fibre reinforced composites can be arranged and processed in order to meet the specific requirements of architectural design and building construction. This was further tested through the design and fabrication of a full-scale architectural prototype.

@highlight We designed and fabricated a full-scale architectural pavilion as a fibre-reinforced polymer monocoque.
@highlight We developed three digital models to design, simulate, analyse and optimize geometric solutions.
@highlight We transferred biomimetic principles into the fibre-reinforced polymer laminate design.
