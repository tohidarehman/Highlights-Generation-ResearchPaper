 We study the recently introduced notion of polylines that form a discrete version of planar curves in affine arc length parametrization, showing that they match the control polylines of curvature continuous uniform quadratic B-splines (with analogous results in ). It is demonstrated how inflection-free planar curves may be approximated by such affine arc length polylines in a way that the polyline is close to an affinely equidistant discretization of the curve and allows good approximations of the smooth affine curvature.

@highlight We study links between splines and discrete affine differential geometry.
@highlight Discrete affine arc length parametrizations lead to B-splines with increased smoothness.
@highlight We introduce an osculating conic of discrete curves in the plane.
@highlight We show how to approximate planar curves with nearly affinely regular polylines.
