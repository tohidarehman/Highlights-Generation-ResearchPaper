 We consider the output processes of some elementary queueing models such as the M/M/1/K queue and the M/G/1 queue. An important performance measure for these counting processes is their variance curve v(t), which gives the variance of the number of customers in the time interval . Recent work has revealed some non-trivial properties dealing with the asymptotic rate at which the variance curve grows. In this paper we add to these results by finding explicit expressions for the intercept term of the linear asymptote. For M/M/1/K queues our results are based on the deviation matrix of the generator. It turns out that by viewing output processes as Markovian Point Processes and considering the deviation matrix, one can obtain explicit expressions for the intercept term, together with some further insight regarding the BRAVO (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs) effect. For M/G/1 queues our results are based on a classic transform of D. J. Daley. In this case we represent the intercept term of the variance curve in terms of the first three moments of the service time distribution. In addition we shed light on a conjecture of Daley, dealing with characterization of stationary M/M/1 queues within the class of stationary M/G/1 queues, based on the variance curve.
