 Due to the complexity of geometry, the feed direction with maximal machining strip width usually varies among different regions over a freeform surface or a shell of surfaces. However, in most traditional tool path generation methods, the surface is treated as one machining region thus only local optimisation might be achieved. This paper presents a new region-based tool path generation method. To achieve the full effect of the optimal feed direction, a surface is divided into several sub-surface regions before tool path computation. Different from the scalar field representation of the machining strip width, a rank-two tensor field is derived to evaluate the machining strip width using ball end mill. The continuous tensor field is able to represent the machining strip widths in all feed directions at each cutter contact point, except at the boundaries between sub-regions. Critical points where the tensor field is discontinuous are defined and classified. By applying critical points in the freeform surface as the start for constructing inside boundaries, the surface could be accurately divided to such that each region contain continuous distribution of feed directions with maximal machining strip width. As a result, tool paths are generated in each sub-surface separately to achieve better machining efficiency. The proposed method was tested using two freeform surfaces and the comparison to several leading existing tool path generation methods is also provided.
