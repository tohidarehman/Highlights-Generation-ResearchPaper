 In this paper a new technique for the extraction of respiratory signal from the single-lead ECG using generalized homomorphic filtering is presented. It is proposed to perform band pass filtering on the cepstrum of the ECG signal to extract the respiratory signal. For this study, transforms used in generalized homomorphic filtering are the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The performance of the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal obtained using the proposed method is compared with the reference respiratory signal in terms of the correlation, magnitude squared coherence coefficients and breath rate accuracy. It is observed from the comparisons that the EDR technique based on generalized homomorphic filtering using DFT performs better than the homomorphic filtering using DCT. The proposed EDR technique is also compared with the two well-known EDR techniques: principal component analysis and R peak amplitude algorithm. It is seen from the results that the proposed EDR technique (R DFT) performs significantly better than the R peak amplitude algorithm, but significant improvements are not observed when compared with the PCA based EDR technique.
