 This paper proposes a new tool for decision support to address geometric over-constrained problems in Computer Aided Design (CAD). It concerns the declarative modeling of geometrical problems. The core of the coordinate free solver used to solve the Geometric Constraint Satisfaction Problem (GCSP) was developed previously by the authors. This research proposes a methodology based on Michelucciâ€™s witness method to determine whether the structure of the problem is over-constrained. In this case, the authors propose a tool for assisting the designer in solving the over-constrained problem by ensuring the consistency of the specifications. An application of the methodology and tool is presented in an academic example.  2.5 2.1578 1.854 2.5 2.1578 1.854 2.3454 2.3 1.7116 2.3454 2.3 1.7116 2.3568 2.0017 1.9667 2.3568 2.0017 1.9667 1.1957 1.3623 1.3575 1.1957 1.3623 1.3575 1.6612 1.3705 1.7222 1.6612 1.3705 1.7222 2.0754 2.1397 1.7289 2.0754 2.1397 1.7289 2.1798 1.4924 1.6768 2.1798 1.4924 1.6768 2.4344 2.271 1.7365 2.4558 2.0012 1.9071 1.9071 1.9762 2.0172 1.741 1.741 1.7689 1.6297 1.7538 1.159 1.5984 1.1054 1.159 1.5984 1.1054 0.41569 0.41832 0.47819 1.389 0.53979 1.0454 1.0454 0.54824 0.67011 1.1941 0.060784 0.67011 1.1941 0.060784 0.98718 0.12051 0.80576 0.98718 0.12051 0.80576 1.754 1.5832 0.83324 1.754 1.5832 0.83324  0.54309 0.63836 0.87313 0.904 1.5846 0.74544 1.8806 1.309 1.1119 0.4288 1.2757 2.0694 4.8563 2.699 1.1408 4.7575 0.82269 1.0271 3.0168 2.0841 0.87694 0.7622 1.786 1.5431 0.53983 0.97193 1.4089 0.78228 0.75185 2.3414 0.84097 0.32545 0.67516 0.8287 0.0076529 0.096649 0.16532 0.060778 1.5895 3.1882 1.8921 0.70222 3.9125 0.50639 1.3099 3.9679 0.86343 0.66885 0.67273 0.28511 1.7211 0.2056 1.3945 0.46582
