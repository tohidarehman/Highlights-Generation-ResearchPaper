 A novel tissue scaffold design technique has been proposed with controllable heterogeneous architecture design suitable for additive manufacturing processes. The proposed layer-based design uses a bi-layer pattern of radial and spiral layers consecutively to generate functionally gradient porosity, which follows the geometry of the scaffold. The proposed approach constructs the medial region from the medial axis of each corresponding layer, which represents the geometric internal feature or the spine. The radial layers of the scaffold are then generated by connecting the boundaries of the medial region and the layer’s outer contour. To avoid the twisting of the internal channels, reorientation and relaxation techniques are introduced to establish the point matching of ruling lines. An optimization algorithm is developed to construct sub-regions from these ruling lines. Gradient porosity is changed between the medial region and the layer’s outer contour. Iso-porosity regions are determined by dividing the sub-regions peripherally into pore cells and consecutive iso-porosity curves are generated using the iso-points from those pore cells. The combination of consecutive layers generates the pore cells with desired pore sizes. To ensure the fabrication of the designed scaffolds, the generated contours are optimized for a continuous, interconnected, and smooth deposition path-planning. A continuous zig–zag pattern deposition path crossing through the medial region is used for the initial layer and a biarc fitted iso-porosity curve is generated for the consecutive layer with continuity. The proposed methodologies can generate the structure with gradient (linear or non-linear), variational or constant porosity that can provide localized control of variational porosity along the scaffold architecture. The designed porous structures can be fabricated using additive manufacturing processes. th contour curve represented with the parameter Unit normal vector on curve at a parametric location Offset distance Upper widths for the biologically allowable pore size for cells in growth Lower widths for the biologically allowable pore size for cells in growth Width of the medial region Medial boundary of th contour curve represented with the parameter Range of parameter for th contour curve Range of parameter for th medial boundary Set of points generated on the external contour curve Set of points generated on the medial boundary curve Number of points generated on with equal cord length sections Number of points generated on with equal cord length sections Counterpart point set for on Counterpart point set for on th point on external contour curve th point on medial boundary curve Set of ruling lines Total number of ruling lines generated Normal direction at point location on external contour curve Normal direction at point location on medial boundary curve Area between and Set of segments, which is defined by the area between two adjacent ruling line Area of th segment Lower width of th segment Upper width of th segment Set of sub-region channels Area of th sub-region Lower width of th sub-region Upper width of th sub-region Expected area of sub-region Expected lower width of sub-region Expected upper width of sub-region Penalty weight for sub-region area deviation Penalty weight for sub-region lower width deviation Penalty weight for sub-region upper width deviation Set of sub-region’s boundary lines Set of pore-cell line segments (iso-porosity) Set of starting points for pore-cell line segment Set of ending points for pore-cell line segment Number of pore cells or iso-porosity regions th pore-cell in th sub-region Deposited filament diameter Set of starting points for Set of end points for Medial axis for th contour curve Set of points projected on from point set Refined pore cell point set Refined iso-porosity line segment Acceptable tolerance for biarc fitting Maximum (Hausdorff) distance between fitted biarc and and
