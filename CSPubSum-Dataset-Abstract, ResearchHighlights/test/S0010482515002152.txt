 This paper presents the mathematical formulation, the numerical validation and several illustrations of a forward-modeling approach based on dipole-current sources to compute the contribution of a part of the heart to the electrocardiogram (ECG). Clinically relevant applications include identifying in the ECG the contributions from the right and the left atrium. In a Courtemanche-based monodomain computer model of the atria and  dipoles distributed throughout the atrial mid-myocardium are found to be sufficient to reproduce body surface potential maps with a relative error during both sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. When the boundary element method is applied to solve the forward problem, this approach enables fast offline computation of the ECG contribution of any anatomical part of the atria by applying the principle of superposition to the dipole sources. In the presence of a right–left activation delay (sinus rhythm), pulmonary vein isolation (sinus rhythm) or left–right differences in refractory period (atrial fibrillation), the decomposition of the ECG is shown to help interpret ECG morphology in relation to the atrial substrate. These tools provide a theoretical basis for a deeper understanding of the genesis of the P wave or fibrillatory waves in normal and pathological cases.

@highlight We used a model of the atria and torso to compute ECG from dipole-current sources.
@highlight We simulated the separate contributions of the left and right atria to the ECG.
@highlight The approach helped relate the P wave morphology to atrial anatomy.
@highlight Atrial fibrillation simulations emphasized the role of each atrium on ECG waveforms.
