 Many of the methods which deal with the reduction of dimensionality in matrices of data are based on mathematical techniques such as distance-based algorithms or matrix decomposition and eigenvalues. Recently a group of likelihood-based finite mixture models for a data matrix with binary or count data, using basic Bernoulli or Poisson building blocks has been developed. This is extended and establishes likelihood-based multivariate methods for a data matrix with ordinal data which applies fuzzy clustering via finite mixtures to the ordered stereotype model. Model-fitting is performed using the expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm, and a fuzzy allocation of rows, columns, and rows and columns simultaneously to corresponding clusters is obtained. A simulation study is presented which includes a variety of scenarios in order to test the reliability of the proposed model. Finally, the results of the application of the model in two real data sets are shown.
