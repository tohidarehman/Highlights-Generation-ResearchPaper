 ï»¿An experimental study on bond wire looping by using high-speed video analysis was presented. By ana-lyzing the video data, capillary velocity, trajectory position and length of the wire and the position ofkinks were extracted. The experimentally â€“ obtained data of kinks are physically interpreted.

@highlight An experimental study on bond wire looping by using high-speed video analysis was presented.
@highlight The video data shows that capillary velocity, trajectory position and the position of kinks.
@highlight The tool’s transverse move in its zigzag motion phase is a necessary step to create kinks.
@highlight Capillary nozzle applies small and localized moment to the segment of fresh wire to create a new kink.
@highlight The residual curvature of kinks would be major target for wire looping design.
