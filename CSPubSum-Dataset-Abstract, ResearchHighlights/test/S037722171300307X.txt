 This paper studies an image collection planning problem for a Korean satellite, KOMPSAT-2 (KOrea Multi-Purpose SATellite-2). KOMPSAT-2 has the mission goal of maximizing image acquisition in time and quality requested by customers and operates under several complicating conditions. One of the characteristics in KOMPSAT-2 is its strip mode operation, in which segments of continuous-observation areas with known sizes are captured one at a time. In this paper, we regard the segment as a group of adjoining geographical square regions (scenes), whose size must also be determined. Thus, the problem involves the determination of proper segment lengths as well as an image collection schedule. We present a binary integer programming model for this problem in a multi-orbit long-term planning environment and provide a heuristic solution approach based on the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods. We also present the results of our computational experiment based on randomly generated data.
