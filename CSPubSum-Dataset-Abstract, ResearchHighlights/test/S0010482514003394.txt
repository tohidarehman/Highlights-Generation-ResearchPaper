 Objective To determine the relationship between CD28 polymorphisms, rs3116496, and cancer. Design Meta-analysis. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases were searched to identify studies reporting the association between CD28 polymorphism and cancer. Two authors selected identified studies, extracted, and analyzed the data independently. Results Individuals carrying a T allele (TT homozygotes and TT+TC heterozygotes) at rs3116496 had a lower incidence of cancer than carriers of a C allele. Subgroup analysis showed that this association held true for Asians, but not Europeans. Conclusion CD28 polymorphism, rs3116496, contributes to cancer susceptibility in the case of multiple cancers.

@highlight We determined the relationship between CD28 polymorphisms, rs3116496, and cancer.
@highlight Carriers of a T allele had a lower incidence of cancer than carriers of a C allele.
@highlight A lower cancer incidence was observed among Asians carrying a T allele.
