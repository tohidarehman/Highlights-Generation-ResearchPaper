 Introduction Several studies have analysed the platelet parameters in human blood, nevertheless there are no extensive analyses on the less common platelet phenotypes. The main objective of our study is to evaluate the age and gender effects on 15 platelet phenotypes. Methods We studied 804 individuals, ranging in age from 2 to 93 years, included in the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia 2 (GAIT 2) Project. The 15 platelet phenotypes analysed were the platelets counts, platelet volumes, plateletcrits, immature platelet fraction (IPF) and platelet function assay (PFA). A regression-based method was used to evaluate the age and gender effects on these phenotypes. Results Our results were consistent with the previously reported results regarding platelet counts and plateletcrit (PCT). They showed a decrease with increasing age. The mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR) increased with age, but did not present any gender effect. All the IPF phenotypes increased with age, whereas the PFA phenotypes did not show any relation to age or gender. Discussion To sum up, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the age and gender effects on the platelet phenotypes in a family-base sample. Our results suggest more reasonable age stratification into two distinct groups: childhood, ranging from 2 to 12 years, and the mature group, from 13 to 93 years. Moreover, the PFA phenotypes were maintained constant while the platelet counts, the MPV and IPF levels vary with age.

@highlight A comprehensive analysis of the age and gender effects on the platelet phenotypes.
@highlight A more reasonable age stratification was proposed: childhood and the mature group.
@highlight The platelet counts, MPV and IPF levels vary over time.
@highlight The PFA phenotypes were mantained invariably over time.
