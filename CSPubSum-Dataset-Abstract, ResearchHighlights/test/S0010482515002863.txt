 Objective Research was conducted on parametric profiles of healthy subjects and patients with cervico-brachial pain syndrome resulting from C4/5 and/or C5/6 discopathy, including magnetic remanence of tissues in marker points 1-12 (L+R) and functional parameters, and their subsequent change after treatment in group A, using method of push-pull galvanic magnetostimulation (GMT 2.0). Design GMT 2.0 device, comprised of one air solenoid and three galvanic solenoids in electrolytic tubs, was designed for push-pull magnetostimulation of the head, coupled with simultaneous stimulation of the limbs. Setting Clinical trial was conducted in Outpatient Private Clinic “VIS” under the auspices of Silesian Higher Medical School in Katowice, Poland. Patients 55 subjects participated in the study: control group K consisted of 23 healthy individuals, whereas 33 patients in group A were treated using GMT 2.0. Intervention Only patients in group A were treated with GMT 2.0 during 40-min sessions over a period of 10 days. Main outcome measures Parametric profile of the patients was defined using various measurements: electronic SFTR test (C-Th-shoulders), HR, RR, BDI and VAS tests, magnetic remanence in marker points 1-12 (L+R) and blood parameters: HB, ER, CREA, BIL, K+, Na+, Cl− Fe2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. Results There was a significant reduction in pain (VAS), increase in the range of motion (SFTR), lower depression symptoms (BDI), slower heart rate (HR), lower blood pressure (RR), greater concentration of Mg2+, K+, Ca2+ions and reduction in the concentration of BIL, CREA Fe2+ after GMT 2.0 treatment in group A. Evaluation of magnetic remanence in marker points M1-12 (L+R) initially showed higher values in group K, which after treatment were normalized to values similar to those in group K. Conclusion GMT 2.0 treatment in group A resulted in normalization of magnetic remanence, synergically with increased range of motion (SFTR test), decreased HR and RR parameters, smaller depressive trends (BDI test), as well as increased ion levels (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) and better functional parameters of kidneys and liver.
