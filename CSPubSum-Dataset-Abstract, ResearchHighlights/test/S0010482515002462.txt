 ï»¿The Monte Carlo method was used for QSAR modeling of maleimide derivatives as glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² inhibitors. The first QSAR model was developed for a series of 74 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives. The second QSAR model was developed for a series of 177 maleimide derivatives. QSAR models were calculated with the representation of the molecular structure by the simplified molecular input-line entry system. Two splits have been examined: one split into the training and test set for the first QSAR model, and one split into the training, test and validation set for the second. The statistical quality of the developed model is very good. The calculated model for 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives had following statistical parameters: r2=0.8617 for the training set; r2=0.8659, and rm2=0.7361 for the test set. The calculated model for maleimide derivatives had following statistical parameters: r2=0.9435, for the training, r2=0.9262 and rm2=0.8199 for the test and r2=0.8418, r(av)m2=0.7469 and âˆ†rm2=0.1476 for the validation set. Structural indicators considered as molecular fragments responsible for the increase and decrease in the inhibition activity have been defined. The computer-aided design of new potential glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² inhibitors has been presented by using defined structural alerts.
