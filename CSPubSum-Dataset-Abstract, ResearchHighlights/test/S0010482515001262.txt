 Background Researchers of translational medicine face numerous challenges in attempting to bring research results to the bedside. This field of research covers a wide range of resources, including blood and tissue samples, which are processed for isolation of RNA and DNA to study cancer omics data (genomics, proteomics and metabolomics). Clinical information about patients׳ habits, family history, physical examinations, remissions, etc., is also important to underpin studies aimed at identifying patterns that lead to the development of cancer and to its successful treatment. Purpose Development of a web-based computer system—BioBankWarden—to manage, consolidate and integrate these diversified data, enabling cancer research groups to retrieve and analyze clinical and biomolecular data within an integrative environment. The system has a three-tier architecture comprising database, logic and user-interface layers. Results The system׳s integrated database and user-friendly interface allow for the control of patient records, biomaterial storage, research groups, research projects, users and biomaterial exchange. Conclusions BioBankWarden can be used to store and retrieve specific information from different clinical fields linked to biomaterials collected from patients, providing the functionalities required to support translational research in the field of cancer.
