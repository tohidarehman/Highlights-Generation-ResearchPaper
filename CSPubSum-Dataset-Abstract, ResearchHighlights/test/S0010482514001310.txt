 This paper investigates a pattern recognition framework in order to determine and classify breast cancer cases. Initially, a two-class separation study classifying normal and abnormal (cancerous) breast tissues is achieved. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Dense Scale Invariant Feature Transform (DSIFT), and Local Configuration Pattern (LCP) methods are used to extract the rotation- and scale-invariant features for all tissue patches. A classification is made utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighborhood (k-NN), Decision Tree, and Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) via 10-fold cross validation. Then, a three-class study (normal, benign, and malignant cancerous cases) is carried out using similar procedures in a two-class case; however, the attained classification accuracies are not sufficiently satisfied. Therefore, a new feature extraction framework is proposed. The feature vectors are again extracted with this new framework, and more satisfactory results are obtained. Our new framework achieved a remarkable increase in recognition performance for the three-class study.

@highlight All healthy mammographic patches are correctly classified by a proposed framework.
@highlight The LCP descriptor is very successful on both microcalcifications and masses.
@highlight LCP parameters are directly computed on frequency domain representation of images.
@highlight Proposed framework is effective on separation of malignant cases from benign ones.
@highlight The new framework can be developed to aid radiologists for more accurate diagnosis.
