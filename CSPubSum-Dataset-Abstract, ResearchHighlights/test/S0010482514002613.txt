 This work is focused on application of a new technique in the first steps of computer-aided detection (CAD) of lung nodules. The scheme includes segmenting the lung volume and detecting most of the nodules with a low number of false positive (FP) objects. The juxtapleural nodules were properly included and the airways excluded in the lung segmentation. Among the suspicious regions obtained from the multiscale dot enhancement filter, those containing the center of nodule candidates, were determined. These center points were achieved from a 3D blob detector based on Laplacian of Gaussian kernels. Then the volumetric shape index (SI) that encodes the 3D local shape information was calculated for voxels in the determined regions. The performance of the scheme was evaluated by using 42 CT images from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). The results show that the average number of FPs reaches to 38.8 per scan with the sensitivity of 95.9% in the initial detections. The scheme is adaptable to detect nodules with wide variations in size, shape, intensity and location. Comparison of results with previously reported ones indicates that the proposed scheme can be satisfactory applied for initial detection of lung nodules in the chest CT images.
