 Coonsâ€™ construction generates a surface patch that interpolates four groups of specified boundary curves and the corresponding cross-boundary derivative curves. This constructive method is simple and widely used in computer aided design. However, at the corner points, it requires compatibility of the boundary conditions, which is usually difficult to satisfy in practice. In order to handle the incompatible case where the normal directions respectively indicated by two adjacent boundaries do not agree with each other at the common corner point, we utilize the property of degenerate parametric surfaces that the normal directions can converge to multiple values at degenerate points, and therefore the local degenerate geometry can satisfy conflicting conditions simultaneously. Following this idea, we use a single patch of -degree polynomial spline surface with four degenerate corners to interpolate incompatible boundary conditions, which are represented by -degree polynomial spline curves with continuity. This method is based on symbolic operations and polynomial reparameterizations for polynomial splines, and without introducing any theoretical errors, it achieves continuity on the boundary except for the four corner points.
