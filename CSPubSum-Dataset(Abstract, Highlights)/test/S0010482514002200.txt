 Background This study aimed to evaluate the stress distribution in a mandibular bone with an implant-supported overdenture by a biological-data-based finite element analysis (FEA) utilizing personal CT images and in vivo loading data, and to evaluate the influence of the number and alignment of implants and bone conditions on the stress in peri-implant bone. Methods FEA models of a mandible were constructed for two types of overdentures: 4 implants supported overdenture (4-OD) and 2 implants supported overdenture (2-OD). The geometry of these models was constructed from CT images of a subject, who wore an implant-supported overdenture. The magnitude and direction of the loads on the implants for two types of overdentures during the maximal voluntary clenching were measured with 3D force transducers. FEA using these loads was carried out to observe stress distributions in peri-implant bone. Results Higher stress was observed in cortical bone around the implant neck. Stress in peri-implant bone for 4-OD was reduced in comparison with those for the 2-OD. For the 4-OD, notwithstanding such reduction of the stress, the stress concentrated at the cortical bone around the implant aligned with large deviation from load direction. Conclusions In this study, biological data from a certain subject was successfully duplicated to the FEA models. The results demonstrate the mechanical prominence of using more implants. Even in 4 implants model, high stress was found around an implant with a large inclination and with thin cortical bone. This suffices to demonstrate the capability and usefulness of the biological-data-based FEA.
