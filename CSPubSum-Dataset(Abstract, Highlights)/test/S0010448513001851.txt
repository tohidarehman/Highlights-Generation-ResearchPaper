 In this paper, we address some computational challenges arising in complex simulation-based design optimization problems. High computational cost, black-box formulation and stochasticity are some of the challenges related to optimization of design problems involving the simulation of complex mathematical models. Solving becomes even more challenging in case of multiple conflicting objectives that must be optimized simultaneously. In such cases, application of multiobjective optimization methods is necessary in order to gain an understanding of which design offers the best possible trade-off. We apply a three-stage solution process to meet the challenges mentioned above. As our case study, we consider the integrated design and control problem in paper mill design where the aim is to decrease the investment cost and enhance the quality of paper on the design level and, at the same time, guarantee the smooth performance of the production system on the operational level. In the first stage of the three-stage solution process, a set of solutions involving different trade-offs is generated with a method suited for computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems using parallel computing. Then, based on the generated solutions an approximation method is applied to create a computationally inexpensive surrogate problem for the design problem and the surrogate problem is solved in the second stage with an interactive multiobjective optimization method. This stage involves a decision maker and her/his preferences to find the most preferred solution to the surrogate problem. In the third stage, the solution best corresponding that of stage two is found for the original problem.
