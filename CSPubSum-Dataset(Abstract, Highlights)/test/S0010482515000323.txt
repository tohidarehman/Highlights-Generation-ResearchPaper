 This study presents a new real-time heartbeat detection algorithm using the geometric angle between two consecutive samples of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The angle was adopted as a new index representing the slope of ECG signal. The method consists of three steps: elimination of high-frequency noise, calculation of the angle of ECG signal, and detection of R-waves using a simple adaptive thresholding technique. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, QT database, European ST-T database, T-wave alternans database and synthesized ECG signals were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare with the results of other methods suggested in literature. The proposed method shows a high detection rateâ€”99.95% of the sensitivity, 99.95% of the positive predictivity, and 0.10% of the fail detection rate on the four databases. The result shows that the proposed method can yield better or comparable performance than other literature despite the relatively simple process. The proposed algorithm needs only a single-lead ECG, and involves a simple and quick calculation. Moreover, it does not require post-processing to enhance the detection. Thus, it can be effectively applied to various real-time healthcare and medical devices.
