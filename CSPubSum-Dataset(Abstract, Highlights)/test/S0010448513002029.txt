 In this paper we propose a strategy for generating consistent hierarchical -meshes which allow local refinement and offer a way to obtain spline basis functions with highest order smoothness incrementally. We describe the required ordering of line-segments during refinement and the construction of spline basis functions. We give our strategy for generating consistent hierarchical -meshes over any shape of a two-dimensional domain.

@highlight An iterative refinement strategy for generating hierarchical
@highlight -meshes is proposed.
@highlight The required ordering of line-segments which form a
@highlight -mesh is specified.
@highlight The construction of spline basis functions is obtained.
@highlight The proposed algorithm includes standard hierarchical
@highlight -splines.
