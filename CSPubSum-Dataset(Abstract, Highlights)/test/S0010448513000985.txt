 Human body modeling is a central task in computer graphics. In this paper, we propose an intelligent model customization method, in which customer’s detailed geometric characteristics can be reconstructed using limited size features extracted from the customer’s orthogonal-view photos. To realize model customization, we first propose a comprehensive shape representation to describe the geometrical shape characteristics of a human body. The shape representation has a layered structure and corresponds to important feature curves that define clothing size. Next, we identify and model a novel relationship model between 2D size features and 3D shape features for each cross-section using real subject scanned data. We predict a customer’s cross-sectional 3D shape based on size features extracted from the customer’s photos, and then we reconstruct the customer’s shape representation using predicted cross-sections. We develop a new deformation algorithm that deforms a template model into a customized shape using the reconstructed 3D shape representation. A total of 30 subjects, male and female, with varied body shapes have been recruited to verify the model customization method. The customized models show high degree of resemblance of the subjects, with accurate body sizes; the accuracy of the models is comparable to scan. It shows that the method is a feasible and efficient solution for human model customization that fulfills the specific needs of the clothing industry.
