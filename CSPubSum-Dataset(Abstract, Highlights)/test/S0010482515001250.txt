 The predictions of a computerized decision-support system (CDSS) are compared to clinical data obtained from a group of premature infants. The infants were suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and were treated by the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. The predictions of the CDSS are found to be in general agreement with clinical measurements. The CDSS is also used to determine the effect of low level oxygen treatment on arterial oxygen pressure if the infant׳s oxygenation is low despite CPAP therapy. Based on the computational results, application of low levels of supplemental inspired fraction of oxygen ( IO ) would result in significant improvement in oxygenation of premature infants provided such treatment is carefully controlled to avoid hyperoxemia.

@highlight A computerized decision support system could give estimations of blood gases of infants on CPAP.
@highlight A computerized decision support system could accurately predict improvement in oxygenation by supplemental oxygen if the infant under CPAP therapy was hypoxemic.
@highlight Computerized decision support systems can be used as helpful tools to analyze infants’ ventilation data.
