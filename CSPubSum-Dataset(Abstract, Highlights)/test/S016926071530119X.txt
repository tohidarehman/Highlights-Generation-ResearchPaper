 Background and objective In the field of biomedical, it becomes necessary to reduce data quantity due to the limitation of storage in real-time ambulatory system and telemedicine system. Research has been underway since very beginning for the development of an efficient and simple technique for longer term benefits. Method This paper, presents an algorithm based on singular value decomposition (SVD), and embedded zero tree wavelet (EZW) techniques for ECG signal compression which deals with the huge data of ambulatory system. The proposed method utilizes the low rank matrix for initial compression on two dimensional (2-D) ECG data array using SVD, and then EZW is initiated for final compression. Initially, 2-D array construction has key issue for the proposed technique in pre-processing. Here, three different beat segmentation approaches have been exploited for 2-D array construction using segmented beat alignment with exploitation of beat correlation. The proposed algorithm has been tested on MIT-BIH arrhythmia record, and it was found that it is very efficient in compression of different types of ECG signal with lower signal distortion based on different fidelity assessments. Results The evaluation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm has achieved the compression ratio of 24.25:1 with excellent quality of signal reconstruction in terms of percentage-root-mean square difference (PRD) as 1.89% for ECG signal Rec. 100 and consumes only 162bps data instead of 3960bps uncompressed data. Conclusion The proposed method is efficient and flexible with different types of ECG signal for compression, and controls quality of reconstruction. Simulated results are clearly illustrate the proposed method can play a big role to save the memory space of health data centres as well as save the bandwidth in telemedicine based healthcare systems.
