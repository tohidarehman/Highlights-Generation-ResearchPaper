 Background Recently there have been several clinical MR perfusion studies in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who may suffer from myocardial ischemia due to coronary microvascular dysfunction. In these studies, data analysis relied on a manual procedure of tracing epicardial and endocardial borders. The goal of this work is to develop and validate a robust semi-automated analysis method for myocardial perfusion quantification in clinical HCM data. Method Dynamic multi-slice stress perfusion MRI data were acquired from 18 HCM patients. The proposed semi-automated method required user input of two landmark selections: LV center point and RV insertion point. Automated segmentations of the endocardial and epicardial borders were performed in three short-axis slices using distance regularized level set evolution on RV, LV, and myocardial enhancement frames. Results The proposed automated epicardial border detection method resulted in average radial distance errors of 7.5%, 9.5%, and 11.6% in basal, mid, and apical slices, respectively, when compared to manual tracing of the borders as a reference. In linear regression analysis, the highest correlation of myocardial upslope measurements was observed between the manual method and the proposed method in the anterolateral section (r=0.964), and the lowest correlation was observed in the inferoseptal section (r=0.866). Conclusion The proposed semi-automated method for myocardial MR perfusion quantification is feasible in HCM patients who typically show  irregular myocardial shape and  low image contrast between the myocardium and its surrounding regions due to coronary microvascular disease.
