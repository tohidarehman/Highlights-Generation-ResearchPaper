 ï»¿T2âŽ maps obtained by the processing of multiecho MR sequences can be useful in several clinical applications. T2âŽ map generation procedures should join a processing time compatible with on-line image analysis with a good precision in the entire T2âŽ range of clinical interest. Fast generation of T2âŽ maps can be achieved by the estimation of the T2âŽ values by the weighted linear fitting of the logarithm of the signal (WLSL) method. This approach fails if the signal decay diverges from a pure exponential decay, as happens at low T2âŽ values where the rapid decay in the signal intensity leads to a plateau in the later echo times (TE). The proposed method implements the automatic truncation of the signal decay curves to be fitted in order to compensate for the signal collapse at low T2âŽ values, allowing the extension of the WLSL method through the entire clinical range of T2âŽ values. Validation was performed on synthetic images and on 60 thalassemia major patients with different levels of myocardial iron overload. Phantom experiments showed that a 5% fitting error threshold represented the best compromise between T2âŽ value measurement precision and processing time. A good agreement was found between T2âŽ map pixel-wise measurements and ROI-based measurements performed by expert readers (CoV=1.84% in global heart T2âŽ, CoV=5.8% in segmental analysis). In conclusion, the developed procedure was effective in generating correct T2âŽ maps for the entire T2âŽ clinical range.
