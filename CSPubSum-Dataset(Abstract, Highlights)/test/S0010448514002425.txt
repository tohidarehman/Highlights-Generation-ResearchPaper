 To determine the relative position of any two surfaces in a system, one approach is to use operations (Minkowski sum and intersection) on sets of constraints. These constraints are made compliant with half-spaces of where each set of half-spaces defines an operand polyhedron. These operands are generally unbounded due to the inclusion of degrees of invariance for surfaces and degrees of freedom for joints defining theoretically unlimited displacements. To solve operations on operands, Minkowski sums in particular, “cap” half-spaces are added to each polyhedron to make it compliant with a polytope which is by definition a bounded polyhedron. The difficulty of this method lies in controlling the influence of these additional half-spaces on the topology of polytopes calculated by sum or intersection. This is necessary to validate the geometric tolerances that ensure the compliance of a mechanical system in terms of functional requirements.  hyperplane of negative closed half-space associated to in positive closed half-space associated to in th cap half-space in the th non-cap half-space in number of non-cap half-spaces in a polytope of number of cap half-spaces in a polytope of th non-cap half-space of polytope th cap half-space of polytope normal fan of polytope normal fan of the polyhedron containing dual cone associated to vertex th vertex of polytope functional polyhedron dimension of the tolerance zone containing the surface translation at point N along -axis rotation along -axis cross product of vectors and
