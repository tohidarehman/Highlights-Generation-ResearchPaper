 Background The “air-puff” tonometers, include the Corvis, are a type of device for measuring intraocular pressure and biomechanics parameters. The paper attempts to analyse this response and its relationship with other parameters measured in the Corvis tonometer. Methods A number of 13,400 2D images were acquired from the Corvis device and analysed (32 healthy and 16 ill people). A new method has been proposed for the analysis of responses of the eyeball based on morphological transformations and contextual operations. Results The proposed algorithm enables to determine responses of the eyeball to an air puff coming from the Corvis tonometer. Additionally, responses of the eyeball have been linked to some selected features of corneal deformation. The results include, among others:  distinguishability between the left and right eye with an error of 7%;  the correlation between the area under the curve in corneal deformation and the response of the eyeball −0.26;  the correlation between the highest concavity time and the maximum deformation amplitude of 0.4. All these features are obtained fully automatically and repetitively at a time of 3.8s per patient (Core i7 10GB RAM). Discussion It is possible to measure additional parameters of the eye deformation which are not available in the original software of the Corvis tonometer. The use of the proposed methods of image analysis and processing provides results directly from the eye response measurement when measuring intraocular pressure.
