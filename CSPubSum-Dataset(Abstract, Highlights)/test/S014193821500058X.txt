 This paper presents a low-power and simple scan driver with a new output module called as AC–DC type output module. 46 stages of the scan driver are fabricated by integrating In–Zn–O Thin-film transistors (IZO TFTs) with back channel etch (BCE) structure on the glass substrate. Under 100 hours’ test, it is shown that the voltage fluctuation of the output signal can be well suppressed by the proposed AC–DC type output module up to the whole 46 stages. The power consumption can be obviously reduced by using the AC–DC type output module compared with the conventional AC–AC type output module. It is measured that the power consumption of one stage for the proposed scan driver with AC–DC type output module at the clock frequency of 16.7kHz is 170μW, as well as 393μW for the proposed scan driver with the conventional AC–AC type output module. It is shown from the simulation results that there is a good tradeoff between the power consumption and the rising time for the proposed AC–DC type output module compared with AC–AC type output module and DC–DC type output module.
