 Mutual exclusion is a fundamental process synchronization problem in concurrent systems. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for mutual exclusion, k-mutual exclusion, mutual inclusion, â„“-mutual inclusion and such, what we call critical section problem. Then, we show that critical section problem is characterized by a pair of integers.

@highlight Critical section problem is characterized by a pair of integers.
@highlight The family of critical section problems is closed under complement operation.
