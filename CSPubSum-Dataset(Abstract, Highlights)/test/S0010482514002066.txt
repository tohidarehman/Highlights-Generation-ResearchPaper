 Functional dependencies (FDs) typically represent associations over facts stored by a database, such as “patients with the same symptom get the same therapy.” In more recent years, some extensions have been introduced to represent both temporal constraints (temporal functional dependencies – TFDs), as “for any given month, patients with the same symptom must have the same therapy, but their therapy may change from one month to the next one,” and approximate properties (approximate functional dependencies – AFDs), as “patients with the same symptom generally have the same therapy.” An AFD holds most of the facts stored by the database, enabling some data to deviate from the defined property: the percentage of data which violate the given property is user-defined. According to this scenario, in this paper we introduce approximate temporal functional dependencies (ATFDs) and use them to mine clinical data. Specifically, we considered the need for deriving new knowledge from psychiatric and pharmacovigilance data. ATFDs may be defined and measured either on temporal granules (e.g. grouping data by day, week, month, year) or on sliding windows (e.g. a fixed-length time interval which moves over the time axis): in this regard, we propose and discuss some specific and efficient data mining techniques for ATFDs. We also developed two running prototypes and showed the feasibility of our proposal by mining two real-world clinical data sets. The clinical interest of the dependencies derived considering the psychiatry and pharmacovigilance domains confirms the soundness and the usefulness of the proposed techniques.

@highlight We focus on dependencies over facts (e.g. diagnosis vs therapy) stored in a database.
@highlight Dependencies may generally hold: deviating facts set up an approximate dependency.
@highlight We group data in sets, either by temporal granules or by fixed-length sliding windows
@highlight Within every set, we look for temporal approximate dependencies.
@highlight We mine psychiatry and pharmacovigilance data sets and derive new knowledge.
