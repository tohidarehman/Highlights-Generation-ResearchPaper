 Being able to automatically mesh composite geometry is an important issue in the context of CADâ€“FEA integration. In some specific contexts of this integration, such as using virtual topology or meshing constraints topology (MCT), it is even a key requirement. In this paper, we present a new approach to automatic mesh generation over composite geometry. The proposed mesh generation approach is based on a generalization of the advancing front method (AFM) over curved surfaces. The adaptation of the AFM to composite faces (composed of multiple boundary representation (B-Rep) faces) involves the computation of complex paths along these B-Rep faces, on which progression of the advancing front is based. Each mesh segment or mesh triangle generated through this progression on composite geometry is likely to lie on multiple B-Rep faces and consequently, it is likely to be associated with a composite definition across multiple parametric spaces. Collision tests between new front segments and existing mesh elements also require specific and significant adaptations of the AFM, since a given front segment is also likely to lie on multiple B-Rep faces. This new mesh generation approach is presented in the context of MCT, which requires being able to handle composite geometry along with non-manifold boundary configurations, such as edges and vertices lying in the interior domain of B-Rep faces.
