 The use of location-aware services to deliver short message advertisements requires an in-depth review of the literature in general and the applicable domains and needs and wants of both marketers and consumers in particular. This paper presents a location-aware service application that develops a recommendation system (RS) for mobile short message advertising (LARSMA). The LARSMA prototype is developed through two stages: system parameter consultation and system development. System parameter consultation involves the collection of advertising categories and their attributes from storeowners and current interests and preferences from mobile phone users. Using a pull-oriented advertising model, system development involves the creation of the LARSMA prototype system, which allows storeowners to create and directly send short messages and mobile phone users within the defined area to automatically retrieve short messages that depend on their inputs. The implicit content-based recommendation mechanism embedded in the designed LARSMA performs filtering and comparison to derive the final top N formatted advertising messages as outputs of LARSMA. An application case is used to demonstrate the proposed LARSMA system prototype. Validation and evaluation are conducted, and feedbacks are addressed.
