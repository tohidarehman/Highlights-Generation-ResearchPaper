 Although many groups have attempted to develop an automated computerized method to detect pathology of the small intestinal mucosa caused by celiac disease, the efforts have thus far failed. This is due in part to the occult presence of the disease. When pathological evidence of celiac disease exists in the small bowel it is visually often patchy and subtle. Due to presence of extraneous substances such as air bubbles and opaque fluids, the use of computerized automation methods have only been partially successful in detecting the hallmarks of the disease in the small intestineÃ¢ÂÂvillous atrophy, fissuring, and a mottled appearance. By using a variety of computerized techniques and assigning a weight or vote to each technique, it is possible to improve the detection of abnormal regions which are indicative of celiac disease, and of treatment progress in diagnosed patients. Herein a paradigm is suggested for improving the efficacy of automated methods for measuring celiac disease manifestation in the small intestinal mucosa. The suggestions are applicable to both standard and videocapsule endoscopic imaging, since both methods could potentially benefit from computerized quantitation to improve celiac disease diagnosis.

@highlight Endoscopic imaging is utilized to diagnose celiac disease and other small bowel disorders.
@highlight Currently, detection of abnormality in the images is mostly done by visual inspection.
@highlight If classification could be quantitated and automated, it would be useful for unbiased and rapid analysis.
@highlight A review of the literature, and pathways to proceed in quantitation, are suggested in the article.
@highlight Use of a variety of features, weighted in order of importance, may provide the best paradigm for quantitation.
