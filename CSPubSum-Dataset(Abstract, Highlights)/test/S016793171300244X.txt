 Using computational modelling we investigate whether Si–H Bonds can serve as precursors for neutral centre formation in amorphous silica and at the Si/SiO2 interface. Classical inter-atomic potentials are used to construct models of a-SiO2 containing Si–H bonds. We then investigate the mechanism of dissociation of a Si–H bond to create a neutral defect, that is a 3-coordinated silicon with an unpaired electron localised on it. We show that the Si–H bond is extremely stable, but as a result of hole injection it is significantly weakened and may dissociate, creating a neutral centre and a proton attached to one of the nearby oxygen atoms. The proton can diffuse around the centre and has a profound effect on the defect levels. We show that at a Si/SiO2 interface, the position of the proton can facilitate electron transfer from the Si substrate onto the defect, making it negatively charged.
