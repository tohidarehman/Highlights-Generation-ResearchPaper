 Holographic displays and super multi-view (SMV) displays have been developed to solve the accommodation–vergence conflict that is responsible for visual fatigue caused by the 3D images that are generated by conventional three-dimensional (3D) displays upon which the eye cannot focus. However, holographic and SMV displays provide 3D images upon which the eye can readily focus so that the accommodation–vergence conflict does not occur. Because these two display techniques require the generation of a very large amount of image data, the high data bandwidth of microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices is effectively utilized. The present article describes the holographic display system that employs a MEMS spatial light modulator (SLM), which increases the screen size and viewing zone angle. Two SMV displays are also described, where one employs MEMS SLMs and the other an array of MEMS projectors. The resolution and the number of viewpoints of the SMV displays have increased. Moreover, the technique using a MEMS SLM to eliminate speckles from holographic reconstructed images is also described.
