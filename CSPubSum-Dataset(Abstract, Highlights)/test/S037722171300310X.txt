 Some manufacturers sponsor “free” retailer gift cards to be given to consumers who purchase their products. These gift cards are paid for by the manufacturer and are redeemable on all products at the retailer. We develop a model of such a supply chain. We analyze cases in which the gift cards’ redemption rate is constant or increasing in gift card value. The results indicate that in addition to the redemption rate and consumers’ valuation for gift card dollars, the profitability of manufacturer-sponsored gift cards depends on the average gross margin of the retailer and the type of purchases consumers make with gift cards. Furthermore, we show that under certain conditions, free gift cards will increase the expected profits of the retailer and manufacturer as well as decrease the retail price of the product. These conditions include a retailer with large average gross margin and consumers using gift cards to purchase products they would not buy with cash otherwise. Furthermore, all consumers, including those who do not redeem the gift card, are more likely to benefit from a reduced retail price when their probability of redeeming the gift card after purchase is equal to their estimated redemption probability at purchase time. We show the conditions under which gift cards are more profitable than cash mail-in rebates. We develop an incentive scheme to improve the performance of supply chains with gift cards.
