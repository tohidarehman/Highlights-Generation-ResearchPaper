 We describe a method for a reconstructing piecewise helix curve from its 2D sketch. The system takes as input a hand-drawn polygonal curve and generates a piecewise helix curve such that its orthogonal projection matches the input curve. The first step is an algorithm to generate a set of helices such that their orthogonal projection approximates the input curve. This step is followed by a global optimization to minimize the tangent discontinuity of the junctions of the helices while keeping the fitting error small.
