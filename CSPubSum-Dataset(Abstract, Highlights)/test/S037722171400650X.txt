 In the multiple container loading cost minimization problem (MCLCMP), rectangular boxes of various dimensions are loaded into rectangular containers of various sizes so as to minimize the total shipping cost. The MCLCMP can be naturally modeled as a set cover problem. We generalize the set cover formulation by introducing a new parameter to model the gross volume utilization of containers in a solution. The state-of-the-art algorithm tackles the MCLCMP using the prototype column generation (PCG) technique. PCG is an effective technique for speeding up the column generation technique for extremely hard optimization problems where their corresponding pricing subproblems are NP-hard. We propose a new approach to the MCLCMP that combines the PCG technique with a goal-driven search. Our goal-driven prototype column generation (GD-PCG) algorithm improves the original PCG approach in three respects. Computational experiments suggest that all three enhancements are effective. Our GD-PCG algorithm produces significantly better solutions for the 350 existing benchmark instances than all other approaches in the literature using less computation time. We also generate two new set instances based on industrial data and the classical single container loading instances.
