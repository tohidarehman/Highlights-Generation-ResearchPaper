 The inequality measure “Quintile Share Ratio” (QSR or sometimes S80/S20) is the primary income inequality measure in the European Union’s set of indicators on social cohesion. An important reason for its adoption as a leading indicator is its simplicity. The Quintile Share Ratio is “The ratio of total income received by the 20% of the population with the highest income (top quintile) to that received by the 20% of the population with the lowest income (lowest quintile)”. The QSR concept is used in this paper in the context of obnoxious facility location where the inequality is in distances to the obnoxious facility. The single facility location problem minimizing the QSR is investigated. The problem is investigated for continuous uniform demand in an area such as a disk, a rectangle, and a line; when demand is generated at a finite set of demand points; and when the facility can be located anywhere on a network. Optimal solution algorithms are devised for demand originating at a finite set of demand points and at nodes of the network. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.

@highlight The European Union is using the “Quintile Share Ratio” (QSR) as a measure of equity.
@highlight We find the location of one facility that minimizes the QSR of service distances.
@highlight The solutions to the QSR objective are similar to those of the Gini index objective.
@highlight Problems with 100,000 demand points were optimally solved in about half a minute.
