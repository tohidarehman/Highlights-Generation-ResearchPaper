 Statement of Problem. Artificial teeth are bonded onto the recesses of a milled denture base in a complete denture prepared using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Little is known, however, about the effects of basal shapes and offset values on the accuracy of positions of the bonded artificial teeth.

@highlight We evaluated optimal shape of artificial teeth for CAD/CAM complete dentures.
@highlight We examined the optimal offset values required for teeth positioning.
@highlight The structures in the basal areas showed accurate positioning for molars/premolars.
@highlight The structures appeared to restrain motion during bonding.
@highlight The optimal offset value was .20mm for molar and premolar teeth.
