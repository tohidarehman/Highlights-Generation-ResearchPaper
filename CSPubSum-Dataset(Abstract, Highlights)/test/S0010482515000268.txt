 ï»¿According to the available literature, penetrating sperm creates an oblique path trough Zona pellucida (ZP) â€“ the most outer surface of oocytes. Considering fertilization process as an oscillatory phenomenon, the influence of sperm impact angle relative to the oscillatory behavior of mouse ZP is described by using the discrete continuum mechanical model in the form of a spherical net model. A parametric frequency analysis of oscillatory behavior of knot material particles in the mouse ZP (mZP) spherical net model is conducted by using generalized Lussajous curves. The influence of impact angles of sperm cells on the corresponding knot mass particlesâ€™ resultant trajectory is discussed. Favorable sperm impact angles for successful fertilization are identified.

@highlight An oscillatory model of spermatozoa–oocyte interaction is proposed.
@highlight By using generalized Lussajous curves, frequency analysis of mZP oscillations was done.
@highlight Oscillations of mZP are influenced by sperm impact angles.
@highlight Very small/very large impact angles are unfavorable for successful fertilization.
@highlight Oblique angles are more fertilization favorable and their values have been predicted.
