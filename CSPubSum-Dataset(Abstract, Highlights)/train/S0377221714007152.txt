 We derive the proper form of the Akaike information criterion for variable selection for mixture cure models, which are often fit via the expectationâ€“maximization algorithm. Separate covariate sets may be used in the mixture components. The selection criteria are applicable to survival models for right-censored data with multiple competing risks and allow for the presence of a non-susceptible group. The method is illustrated on credit loan data, with pre-payment and default as events and maturity as the non-susceptible case and is used in a simulation study.

@highlight The variable selection method AIC is derived for credit risk studies.
@highlight Single and multiple event mixture cure survival models are fit with EM algorithms.
@highlight Different covariates are allowed to be selected in different model parts.
@highlight The method is implemented in the software R.
