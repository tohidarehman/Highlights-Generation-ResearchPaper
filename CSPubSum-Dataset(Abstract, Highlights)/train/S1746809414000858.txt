 This paper introduces a novel variational method for ultrasound image denoising for speckle suppression and edge enhancement. This method is designed to utilize the favorable denoising properties of framelet regularization and edge enhancement of backward diffusion technique. The sparsity and multiresolution properties of the framelet is well suited for speckle noise reduction. The fidelity term of the method can be obtained by Maximum a Posteriori (MAP). The introduction of backward diffusion and framelet regularization makes it difficult to solve the variational energy function. To simplify minimization problem, the Split Bregman algorithm for the proposed model is proposed and then we use it for ultrasound image denoising. Experiment results validate the usefulness of the proposed method for ultrasound image denoising.
