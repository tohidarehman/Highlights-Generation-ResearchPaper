 Photo-voltaic Energy Storage Systems (PVESS) are the widely used non-conventional energy sources. System's reliability could be improved by standardizing its transducers and controller components as per IEEE 1451.0 standard protocol. The protocol defines the commands and functions required to interface transducers in digital domain using two functional modules namely “Transducer Interface Module” (TIM) and “Transducer Electronic Data Sheet” (TEDS). This paper presents a novel modular control structure of TIM and corresponding TEDS of a photo-voltaic system. Smart transducer interface module proposed in this paper can be embedded to the PVESS system. Effectiveness of the proposed smart system is illustrated for battery storage system using solar energy. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the protocol provides a compact Smart Energy Storage System (SESS). It supports knowledge based reconfigurable control module using TEDS information. Spartan 6 FPGA is chosen to implement the architecture with necessary command execution unit to effectively utilize TEDS information. Proposed architecture is implemented in FPGA and its performance is validated for battery storage system.
