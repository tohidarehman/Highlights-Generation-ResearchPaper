 Lately, the use of mobile applications in Smartphones has grown considerably. One of the most popular types of applications is videogames. As classic videogame development is a costly process several editors and tools to make this process quicker and easier have appeared. Although these editors allow the definition of various aspects of the videogame they do not include, in general, capabilities for modeling the logic of the game loop. In this research we propose VGPM, a specific notation based in the BPMN approach to define several important characteristics of the game logic, trying to reduce the cost of traditional videogame development.
