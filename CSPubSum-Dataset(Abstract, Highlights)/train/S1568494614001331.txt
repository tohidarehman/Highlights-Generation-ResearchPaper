 Simplified fuzzy ARTMAP (SFAM) is used in numerous classification problems due to its high discriminant power and low training time. However, the performance of SFAM is affected by the presentation order of the training patterns. The genetic algorithm (GA) can be considered as a solution to the problem because the selection of the training pattern order is a complicated combinatorial problem in a large search space. In this paper, a new genetic ordering method for SFAM is proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm. Special genetic operators are employed in the genetic evolution. Compared to the conventional methods, the proposed SFAM demonstrates better classification performance since it can efficiently deliver the desirable properties of parents to their offspring. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we perform experiments on various databases from the UCI repository.
