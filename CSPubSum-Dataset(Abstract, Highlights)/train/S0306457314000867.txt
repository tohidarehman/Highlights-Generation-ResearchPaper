 Media sharing applications, such as Flickr and Panoramio, contain a large amount of pictures related to real life events. For this reason, the development of effective methods to retrieve these pictures is important, but still a challenging task. Recognizing this importance, and to improve the retrieval effectiveness of tag-based event retrieval systems, we propose a new method to extract a set of geographical tag features from raw geo-spatial profiles of user tags. The main idea is to use these features to select the best expansion terms in a machine learning-based query expansion approach. Specifically, we apply rigorous statistical exploratory analysis of spatial point patterns to extract the geo-spatial features. We use the features both to summarize the spatial characteristics of the spatial distribution of a single term, and to determine the similarity between the spatial profiles of two terms â€“ i.e., term-to-term spatial similarity. To further improve our approach, we investigate the effect of combining our geo-spatial features with temporal features on choosing the expansion terms. To evaluate our method, we perform several experiments, including well-known feature analyzes. Such analyzes show how much our proposed geo-spatial features contribute to improve the overall retrieval performance. The results from our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and viability of our method.
