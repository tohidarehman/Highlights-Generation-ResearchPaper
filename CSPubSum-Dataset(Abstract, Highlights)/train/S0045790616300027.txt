 In this paper, we consider the performance of a cellular uplink (UL) multi-user feedback multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by joint transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) design and polarization-multiplexing (PM). PM is realized with the aid of dual and triply-polarized antennas. At the transmitter, we take advantage of only the individual user’s channel impulse responses (CIRs) obtained through feedback channels that endure noise, fading and delay to construct the preprocessing matrix, while at the receiver the post-processing matrix construction relies on the perfect CIRs of all the users. In multi-user UL-MIMO transmissions, multiple-access interference (MAI) and inter-antenna interference (IAI) can severely degrade the system’s performance. Our study shows that the joint Tx-Rx is capable of completely eliminating the IAI as well as the MAI when it employs perfect CIRs based preprocessing and post-processing. On the other hand, noise, fading and delay tainted quantized-CIRs based preprocessing results in noticeable performance degradation due to imperfect removal of IAI. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that, when the preprocessing is based on the quantized-CIRs obtained through ideal feedback channels, the resultant achievable symbol-error-rate and sum-capacity remain close to that obtained with the perfect CIRs based design.
