 New variants of greedy algorithms, called advanced greedy algorithms, are identified for knapsack and covering problems with linear and quadratic objective functions. Beginning with single-constraint problems, we provide extensions for multiple knapsack and covering problems, in which objects must be allocated to different knapsacks and covers, and also for multi-constraint (multi-dimensional) knapsack and covering problems, in which the constraints are exploited by means of surrogate constraint strategies. In addition, we provide a new graduated-probe strategy for improving the selection of variables to be assigned values. Going beyond the greedy and advanced greedy frameworks, we describe ways to utilize these algorithms with multi-start and strategic oscillation metaheuristics. Finally, we identify how surrogate constraints can be utilized to produce inequalities that dominate those previously proposed and tested utilizing linear programming methods for solving multi-constraint knapsack problems, which are responsible for the current best methods for these problems. While we focus on 0â€“1 problems, our approaches can readily be adapted to handle variables with general upper bounds.
