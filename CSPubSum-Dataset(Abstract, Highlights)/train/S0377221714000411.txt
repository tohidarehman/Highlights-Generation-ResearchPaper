 The voting system of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (Legco) is sometimes unicameral and sometimes bicameral, depending on whether the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government. Therefore, although without any representative within Legco, the Hong Kong government has certain degree of legislative power – as if there is a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government within the Legco. By introducing such a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government, we show that Legco is a three-dimensional voting system. We also calculate two power indices of the Hong Kong government through this virtual representative and consider the C-dimension and the W-dimension of Legco. Finally, some implications of this Legco model to the current constitutional reform in Hong Kong will be given.

@highlight Give a model for the voting system of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (Legco).
@highlight Legco of size 2n is of dimension 3 if n
@highlight ⩾5.
@highlight When
@highlight is even, Legco of size 2n is of W-dimension 1 and C-dimension 2.
@highlight When
@highlight is odd, Legco of size 2n is of W-dimension 2 and C-dimension 3.
@highlight The Banzhaf Index and Shapley–Shubik Index of the Hong Kong government were found.
