 Traveling salesman problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization model studied in the operations research community for nearly half a century, yet there is surprisingly little literature that addresses uncertainty and multiple objectives in it. A novel TSP variation, called uncertain multiobjective TSP (UMTSP) with uncertain variables on the arc, is proposed in this paper on the basis of uncertainty theory, and a new solution approach named uncertain approach is applied to obtain Pareto efficient route in UMTSP. Considering the uncertain and combinatorial nature of UMTSP, a new ABC algorithm inserted with reverse operator, crossover operator and mutation operator is designed to this problem, which outperforms other algorithms through the performance comparison on three benchmark TSPs. Finally, a new benchmark UMTSP case study is presented to illustrate the construction and solution of UMTSP, which shows that the optimal route in deterministic TSP can be a poor route in UMTSP.

@highlight Consider uncertainty and multiple objectives in traveling salesman problem first time.
@highlight Propose a new approach to obtain Pareto efficient route in the uncertain multiobjective TSP, which converts the uncertain multiobjective TSP into an uncertain single objective TSP.
@highlight Present a variant ABC algorithm specified for solving uncertain multiobjective TSP, and it outperforms other classical algorithms on the benchmark TSPs, such as GA, PSO, ACO, etc.
