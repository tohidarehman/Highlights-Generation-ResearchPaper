 Software engineering standards developed under the auspices of ISO/IEC JTC1's SC7 have been identified as employing terms whose definitions vary significantly between standards. This led to a request in 2012 to investigate the creation of an ontological infrastructure that aims to be a single coherent underpinning for all SC7 standards, present and future. Here, we develop that necessary infrastructure prior to its adoption by SC7 and its implementation . The proposal described here requires, firstly, the identification of a single comprehensive set of definitions, the definitional elements ontology (DEO). For the scope of an individual standard, only a subset of these definitional elements will be needed. Once configured, this definitional subset creates a configured definitional ontology or CDO. Both the DEO and the CDO are essentially foundational ontologies from which a domain-specific ontology known as a SDO or standard domain ontology can be created. Consequently, all such SDOs are conformant to a CDO and hence to the single DEO thus ensuring that all standards use the same ontological base. Standards developed in this fashion will therefore be not only of a higher quality but also, importantly, interoperable.

@highlight We propose an ontological framework to unify ISO software engineering standards.
@highlight A comprehensive foundational ontology is proposed: definitional elements ontology.
@highlight We discuss how DEO is tailored to a project-specific foundational ontology (a CDO).
@highlight Many standards are examples of standard domain ontology (SDO) conformant to the CDO.
@highlight We explain how this ontological architecture is created and maintained within SC7.
