,, in recent years continues to underscore the need for better prediction and preparation in the face of storm surge and rising sea levels. Simulations of coastal flooding using physically based hydrodynamic codes like ADCIRC, while very accurate, are also computationally expensive, making them impractical for iterative design scenarios that seek to evaluate a range of countermeasures and possible failure points. We present a graphical user interface that supports local analysis of engineering design alternatives based on an exact reanalysis technique called subdomain modeling, an approach that substantially reduces the computational effort required. This interface, called the Subdomain Modeling Tool (SMT), streamlines the pre- and post-processing requirements of subdomain modeling by allowing modelers to extract regions of interest interactively and by organizing project data on the file system. Software design and implementation issues that make the approach practical, such as a novel range search algorithm, are presented. Descriptions of the overall methodology, software architecture, and performance results are given, along with a case study demonstrating its use.
