 Sensor node localization is considered as one of the most significant issues in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and is classified as an unconstrained optimization problem that falls under NP-hard class of problems. Localization is stated as determination of physical co-ordinates of the sensor nodes that constitutes a WSN. In applications of sensor networks such as routing and target tracking, the data gathered by sensor nodes becomes meaningless without localization information. This work aims at determining the location of the sensor nodes with high precision. Initially this work is performed by localizing the sensor nodes using a range-free localization method namely, Mobile Anchor Positioning (MAP) which gives an approximate solution. To further minimize the location error, certain meta-heuristic approaches have been applied over the result given by MAP. Accordingly, Bat Optimization Algorithm with MAP (BOA-MAP), Modified Cuckoo Search with MAP (MCS-MAP) algorithm and Firefly Optimization Algorithm with MAP (FOA-MAP) have been proposed. Root mean square error (RMSE) is used as the evaluation metrics to compare the performance of the proposed approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed FOA-MAP approach minimizes the localization error and outperforms both MCS-MAP and BOA-MAP approaches.
