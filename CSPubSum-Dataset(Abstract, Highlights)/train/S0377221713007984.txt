 In this note we derive alternative weighting schemes that complement those of FÃ¤ for consistent aggregation of Farrell efficiencies when the technology exhibits (global) constant returns to scale.

@highlight Aggregation of output- and input-oriented technical efficiency indices.
@highlight Aggregation weights under constant returns to scale technology.
@highlight Interchange of input- and output-based aggregation weights.
