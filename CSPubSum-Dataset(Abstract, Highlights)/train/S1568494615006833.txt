 The 0-1 knapsack problem is a classic combinational optimization problem. However, many exiting algorithms have low precision and easily fall into local optimal solutions to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a binary version of the monkey algorithm where the greedy algorithm is used to strengthen the local search ability, the somersault process is modified to avoid falling into local optimal solutions, and the cooperation process is adopted to speed up the convergence rate of the algorithm. To validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, experiments are carried out with various data instances of 0-1 knapsack problems and the results are compared with those of five metaheuristic algorithms.
