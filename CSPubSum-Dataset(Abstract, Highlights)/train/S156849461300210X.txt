 Control of power electronics converters used in PV system is very much essential for the efficient operation of the solar system. In this paper, a modified incremental conduction maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm in conjunction with an adaptive fuzzy controller is proposed to control the DC–DC boost converter in the PV system under rapidly varying atmospheric and partial shading conditions. An adaptive hysteresis current controller is proposed to control the inverter. The proposed current controller provides constant switching frequency with less harmonic content compared with fixed hysteresis current control algorithm and sinusoidal PWM controller. The modeling and simulation of PV system along with the proposed controllers are done using MATLAB/SIMSCAPE software. Simulation results show that the proposed MPPT algorithm is faster in transient state and presents smoother signal with less fluctuations in steady state. The hardware implementation of proposed MPPT algorithm and inverter current control algorithms using Xilinx spartran-3 FPGA is also presented. The experimental results show satisfactory performance of the proposed approaches.
