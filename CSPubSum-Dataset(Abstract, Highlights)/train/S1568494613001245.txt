 Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is one of the planning strategies adopted in the daily power system operation and control. All though many forecasting models have been developed through the years, the uncertainties present in the load profile significantly degrade the performance of these models. The uncertainties are mainly due to the sensitivity of the load demand with varying weather conditions, consumption pattern during month and day of the year. Therefore, the effect of these weather variables on the load consumption pattern is discussed. Based on the literature survey, artificial neural networks (ANN) models are found to be an alternative to classical statistical methods in terms of accuracy of the forecasted results. However, handling of bulk volumes of historical data and forecasting accuracy is still a major challenge. The development of third generation neural networks such as spike train models which are closer to their biological counterparts is recently emerging as a robust model. So, this paper presents a load forecasting system known as the SNNSTLF (spiking neural network short-term load forecaster). The proposed model has been tested on the database obtained from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) website for Victoria State.

@highlight Implementation of SNN to STLF is proposed in this paper.
@highlight Testing and validation is carried out on the load data for Victoria in Australia.
@highlight The impact of weather variables on the accuracy of proposed model is discussed.
@highlight The error indices obtained indicate that SNN is superior to ANN and Hybrid models.
