 Two novel carbazole/anthracene hybrided molecules, namely 2-(anthracen-9-yl)-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (AnCz) and 2,7-di(anthracen-9-yl)-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (2AnCz), were designed and synthesized via palladium catalyzed coupling reaction. The anthracene was attached either at the 2-site (AnCz) or at both 2,7-sites (2AnCz) of the central carbazole core to tune the conjugation state and the optoelectronic properties of the resultant molecules. Both of them show good solubility in common organic solvents. They also possess relatively high HOMO levels (−5.39eV, −5.40eV) that would facilitate efficient hole injection and be favorable for high power efficiencies when used in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). AnCz and 2AnCz were used as non-doped emitter to fabricate OLEDs by vacuum evaporation. Good performance was achieved with maximum luminance efficiency of 2.61cdA−1 and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.12) for AnCz, and 9.52cdA−1 and (0.22, 0.37) for 2AnCz.
