 This study investigates business-to-customer (B2C) electronic commerce services from a quality management perspective. We propose a novel quality management approach that is based on human factors engineering to manage e-commerce service quality and operate according to customer needs. First, we screen credible quality requirements and determine their weights by integrating Kano’s model with our previous work, including the model of B2C website service quality. Then, we can extract quality characteristics according to image words and credible customer requirements. The weights of the quality characteristics are deduced by refining characteristics through a house of quality reconstruction and mapping customer requirements to characteristics. Finally, based on related theories or viewpoints, the operating practices for quality characteristics entail quantitative output with importance and grades taken into consideration. Our experimental results demonstrate that operating practices can help managers understand e-commerce service quality and have useful implications for companies in the management of e-commerce service quality.
