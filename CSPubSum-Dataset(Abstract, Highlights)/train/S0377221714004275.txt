 This article studies the influence of risk on farms’ technical efficiency levels. The analysis extends the order- to the state-contingent framework. The empirical application focuses on cross section data of Catalan specialized crop farms from the year 2011. Results suggest that accounting for production risks increases the technical performance. A 10% increase in output risk will result in a 2.5% increase in average firm technical performance.

@highlight We study the influence of risk on farms’ technical efficiency levels.
@highlight An extension of the order-m efficiency scores is used.
@highlight The state-contingent framework is used to model risk.
@highlight The empirical application focuses on a sample of Catalan arable crop farms.
@highlight Accounting for production risks increases the technical performance.
