 Boolean functions represent an important primitive in the design of various cryptographic algorithms. There exist several well-known schemes where a Boolean function is used to add nonlinearity to the cipher. Thus, methods to generate Boolean functions that possess good cryptographic properties present an important research goal. Among other techniques, evolutionary computation has proved to be a well-suited approach for this problem. In this paper, we present three different objective functions, where each inspects important cryptographic properties of Boolean functions, and examine four evolutionary algorithms. Our research confirms previous results, but also sheds new insights on the effectiveness and comparison of different evolutionary algorithms for this problem.
