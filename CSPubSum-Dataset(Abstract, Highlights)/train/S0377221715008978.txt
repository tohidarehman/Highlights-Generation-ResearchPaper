 In their recent paper, Hämäläinen, Luoma, have made a strong case for the importance of Behavioural OR. With the motivation to contribute to a broad academic outlook in this emerging discipline, this rather programmatic paper intends to further the discussion by describing three types of research tasks that should play an important role in Behavioural OR, namely a descriptive, a methodological and a technological task. Moreover, by relating Behavioural OR to similar academic endeavours, three potential pitfalls are presented that Behavioural OR should avoid:  a too narrow understanding of what “behavioural” means,  ignorance of interdisciplinary links, and  a development without close connection with the core disciplines of OR. The paper concludes by suggesting a definition of Behavioural OR that sums up all points addressed.

@highlight It is crucial for the development of Behavioural OR (BOR) to have a broad outlook.

@highlight The paper addresses 3 pitfalls that BOR should avoid.
@highlight The paper suggests a definition of BOR that takes all these aspects into account.
