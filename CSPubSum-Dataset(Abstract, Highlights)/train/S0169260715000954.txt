 Background and objective Several abnormal brain regions are known to be linked to depression, including amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) etc. The aim of this study is to apply EEG (electroencephalogram) data analysis to investigate, with respect to mild depression, whether there exists dysregulation in these brain regions. Methods EEG sources were assessed from 9 healthy and 9 mildly depressed subjects who were classified according to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) criteria. t-Test was used to calculate the eye movement data and standardized low resolution tomography (sLORETA) was used to correlate EEG activity. Results A comparison of eye movement data between the healthy and mild depressed subjects exhibited that mildly depressed subjects spent more time viewing negative emotional faces. Comparison of the EEG from the two groups indicated higher theta activity in BA6 (Brodmann area) and higher alpha activity in BA38. Conclusions EEG source location results suggested that temporal pole activity to be dysregulated, and eye-movement data analysis exhibited mild depressed subjects paid much more attention to negative face expressions, which is also in accordance with the results of EEG source location.

@highlight An experiment measure eye movement and EEG simultaneously.
@highlight Apply EEG source location to detect abnormal regions of mild depression.
@highlight Different data to analyses difference between mild depressed subjects and health people.
