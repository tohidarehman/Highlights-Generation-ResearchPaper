 Systems biology approach to investigate biological phenomena seems to be very promising because it is capable to capture one of the fundamental properties of living organisms, i.e. their inherent complexity. It allows for analysis biological entities as complex systems of interacting objects. The first and necessary step of such an analysis is building a precise model of the studied biological system. This model is expressed in the language of some branch of mathematics, as for example, differential equations. During the last two decades the theory of Petri nets has appeared to be very well suited for building models of biological systems. The structure of these nets reflects the structure of interacting biological molecules and processes. Moreover, on one hand, Petri nets have intuitive graphical representation being very helpful in understanding the structure of the system and on the other hand, there is a lot of mathematical methods and software tools supporting an analysis of the properties of the nets. In this paper a Petri net based model of the hemojuvelin–hepcidin axis involved in the maintenance of the human body iron homeostasis is presented. The analysis based mainly on T-invariants of the model properties has been made and some biological conclusions have been drawn.
