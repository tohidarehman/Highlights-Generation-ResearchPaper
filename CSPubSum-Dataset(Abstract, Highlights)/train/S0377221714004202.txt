 Based on the minimal reduction strategy, Yang et al.  developed a fixed-sum output data envelopment analysis (FSODEA) approach to evaluate the performance of decision-making units (DMUs) with fixed-sum outputs. However, in terms of such a strategy, all DMUs compete over fixed-sum outputs with “no memory” that will result in differing efficient frontiers’ evaluations. To address the problem, in this study, we propose an equilibrium efficiency frontier data envelopment analysis (EEFDEA) approach, by which all DMUs with fixed-sum outputs can be evaluated based on a common platform (or equilibrium efficient frontier). The proposed approach can be divided into two stages. Stage 1 constructs a common evaluation platform via two strategies: an extended minimal adjustment strategy and an equilibrium competition strategy. The former ensures that original efficient DMUs are still efficient, guaranteeing the existence of a common evaluation platform. The latter makes all DMUs achieve a common equilibrium efficient frontier. Then, based on the common equilibrium efficient frontier, Stage 2 evaluates all DMUs with their original inputs and outputs. Finally, we illustrate the proposed approach by using two numerical examples.

@highlight Our method guarantees all DMUs are evaluated based on a common efficient frontier.
@highlight Each round of adjustment has “memory” which makes the equilibrium possible.
@highlight Our method deals with fixed-sum outputs from one dimension to multi-dimensions.
@highlight Our method makes full rank orders of DMUs.
