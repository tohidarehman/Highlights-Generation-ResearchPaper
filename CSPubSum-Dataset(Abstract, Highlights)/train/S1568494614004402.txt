 In this paper, we introduce a novel iterative method to finding the fixed point of a nonlinear function. Therefore, we combine ideas proposed in Artificial Bee Colony algorithm  and Bisection method . This method is new and very efficient for solving a non-linear equation. We illustrate this method with four benchmark functions and compare results with others methods, such as ABC, PSO, GA and Firefly algorithms.
