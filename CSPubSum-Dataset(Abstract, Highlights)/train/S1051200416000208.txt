 Texture is a prominent feature of image and very useful in feature extraction for image retrieval application. Statistical and structural patterns have been proposed for image retrieval and browsing. In the proposed work, a new texture feature descriptor is developed. The proposed method uses local intensity of pixels based on three directions in the neighborhood and named as the local tri-directional pattern (LTriDP). Also, one magnitude pattern is merged for better feature extraction. The proposed method is tested on three databases, in which first two, Brodatz texture image database and MIT VisTex database are texture image databases and third one is the AT&T face database. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proven by comparing it with existing algorithms for image retrieval application.

@highlight A new feature descriptor called local tri-directional pattern has been proposed.
@highlight The proposed method makes use of directional information using local intensities.
@highlight This feature descriptor is composed of a local pattern and a magnitude pattern.
@highlight The proposed method has been applied on texture and face image databases.
