 Solution of optimal power flow (OPF) problem aims to optimize a selected objective function such as fuel cost, active power loss, total voltage deviation (TVD) etc. via optimal adjustment of the power system control variables while at the same time satisfying various equality and inequality constraints. In the present work, a particle swarm optimization with an aging leader and challengers (ALC-PSO) is applied for the solution of the OPF problem of power systems. The proposed approach is examined and tested on modified IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test power system with different objectives that reflect minimization of fuel cost or active power loss or TVD. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with other evolutionary optimization techniques surfaced in recent state-of-the-art literature. Statistical analysis, presented in this paper, indicates the robustness of the proposed ALC-PSO algorithm.
