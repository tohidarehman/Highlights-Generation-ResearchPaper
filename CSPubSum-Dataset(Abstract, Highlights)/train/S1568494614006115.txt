 This research is conducted such that the bodywork vertical vibration acceleration of a quarter car model is selected as a control objective and Fuzzy-PID control strategy based on improved cultural algorithm is proposed for vibration reduce. Cultural algorithm and niche algorithm are mixed together to design Fuzzy-PID controller and optimize control rules, which can accelerate optimization speed and has a good global optimal performance. The numerical results show that the active suspension, with Fuzzy-PID control strategy in which control rules are optimized by improved cultural algorithm, can significantly suppress the bodywork vertical vibration acceleration, and the ride comfort is improved. All the simulation analyses can give the support for the optimal control scheme.
