 We introduce a novel methodology for ranking hesitant fuzzy sets. It builds on a recent, theoretically sound contribution in Social Choice. In order to justify the applicability of such analysis, we develop two real implementations: (i) new metarankings of world academic institutions that build on real data from three reputed agencies, and (ii) a new procedure for improving teaching performance assessments which we illustrate with real data collected by ourselves.
