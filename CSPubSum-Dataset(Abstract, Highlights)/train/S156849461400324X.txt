 In medical system, there may be many critical diseases, where experts do not have sufficient knowledge to handle those problems. For these cases, experts may provide their opinion only about certain aspects of the disease and remain silent for those unknown features. Feeling the need of prioritizing different experts based on their given information, this article uses a novel concept for assigning confident weights to different experts which are mainly based on their provided information. Experts provide their opinions about various symptoms using intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix (IFSM). In this article, we propose an algorithmic approach based on intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) which explores a particular disease reflecting the agreement of all experts. This approach is guided by the group decision making (GDM) model and uses cardinals of IFSS as novel concept. We have used choice matrix (CM) as an important parameter which is based on choice parameters of individual expert. This article has also validated the proposed approach using distance measurements and consents of the majority of experts. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a suitable case study.
