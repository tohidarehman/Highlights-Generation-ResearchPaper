 The Blocks Relocation Problem consists in minimizing the number of movements performed by a gantry crane in order to retrieve a subset of containers placed into a bay of a container yard according to a predefined order. A study on the mathematical formulations proposed in the related literature reveals that they are not suitable for its solution due to their high computational burden. Moreover, in this paper we show that, in some cases, they do not guarantee the optimality of the obtained solutions. In this regard, several optimization methods based on the well-known A∗ search framework are introduced to tackle the problem from an exact point of view. Using our A∗ algorithm we have corrected the optimal objective function value of 17 solutions out of 45 instances considered by Caserta et al.  . In addition, this work presents a domain-specific knowledge-based heuristic algorithm to find high-quality solutions by means of short computational times. It is based on finding the most promising positions into the bay where to relocate those containers that are currently located on the next one to be retrieved, in such a way that, they do not require any additional relocation operation in the future. The computational tests indicate the higher effectiveness and efficiency of the suggested heuristic when solving real-world scenarios in comparison with the most competitive approaches from the literature.
