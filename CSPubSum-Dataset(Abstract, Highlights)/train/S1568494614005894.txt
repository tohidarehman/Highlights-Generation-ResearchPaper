 This paper deals with the design of a novel fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller for automatic generation control (AGC) of a two unequal area interconnected thermal system. For the first time teaching–learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is applied in this area to obtain the parameters of the proposed fuzzy-PID controller. The design problem is formulated as an optimization problem and TLBO is employed to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy-PID controller. The superiority of proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing the results with some of the recently published approaches such as Lozi map based chaotic optimization algorithm (LCOA), genetic algorithm (GA), pattern search (PS) and simulated algorithm (SA) based PID controller for the same system under study employing the same objective function. It is observed that TLBO optimized fuzzy-PID controller gives better dynamic performance in terms of settling time, overshoot and undershoot in frequency and tie-line power deviation as compared to LCOA, GA, PS and SA based PID controllers. Further, robustness of the system is studied by varying all the system parameters from −50% to +50% in step of 25%. Analysis also reveals that TLBO optimized fuzzy-PID controller gains are quite robust and need not be reset for wide variation in system parameters.
