 In many application areas such as airlines and hotels a large number of bookings are typically cancelled. Explicitly taking into account cancellations creates an opportunity for increasing revenue. that takes cancellations into account in addition to customer choice behaviour. Moreover, we consider overbooking limits as these are influenced by cancellations. We model the problem as a Markov decision process and propose three dynamic programming formulations to solve the problem, each appropriate in a different setting. We show that in certain settings the problem can be solved exactly using a tractable solution method. For other settings we propose tractable heuristics, since the problem faces the curse of dimensionality. Numerical results show that the heuristics perform almost as good as the exact solution. However, the model without cancellations can lead to a revenue loss of up to 20 percent. Lastly we provide a parameter estimation method based on Newman etÂ al. . This estimation method is fast and provides good parameter estimates. The combination of the model, the tractable and well-performing solution methods, and the parameter estimation method ensures that the model can efficiently be applied in practice.

@highlight We propose a revenue management model that takes into account both cancellations and customer choice behaviour.
@highlight We develop efficient heuristic solution methods to optimise revenue.
@highlight We propose a method to estimate the parameters of the model from real data.
@highlight Numerical results show that the heuristics perform very well.
