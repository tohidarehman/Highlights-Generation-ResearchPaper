 This study reports on the requirements for developing computer-interpretable rules for checking the compliance of a building design in a request for proposal (RFP), especially in the building information modeling (BIM) environment. It focuses on RFPs for large public buildings (over 5million dollars) in South Korea, which generally entail complex designs. A total of 27 RFPs for housing, office, exhibition, hospital, sports center, and courthouse projects were analyzed to develop computer-interpreted RFP rules. Each RFP was composed of over 1800 sentences. Of these, only three to 366 sentences could be translated into a computer-interpretable sentence. For further analysis, this study deployed context-free grammar (CFG) in natural language processing, and classified morphemes into four categories: i.e., object (noun), method (verb), strictness (modal), and others. The subcategorized morphemes included three types of objects, twenty-nine types of methods, and five levels of strictness. The coverage applicability of the derived objects and methods was checked and validated against three additional RFP cases and then through a test case using a newly developed model checker system. The findings are expected to be useful as a guideline and basic data for system developers in the development of a generalized automated design checking system for South Korea.

@highlight We analyze objects and methods required for checking automated design compliance.
@highlight We analyze 27 RFPs for various types of large public buildings in South Korea.
@highlight Only 14% of over 9800 RFP sentences are analyzed as being computer-interpretable.
@highlight Three types of objects and 29 types of methods are derived.
@highlight The sufficiency of the objects and methods is validated using additional RFPs.
