 In 1996, a trinucleotide circular code X is identified in genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes . In 2012, X motifs are identified in the transfer RNA (tRNA) Phe and 16S ribosomal RNA . A statistical analysis of X motifs in all available tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in the genomic tRNA database  is carried out here. For this purpose, a search algorithm of X motifs in a DNA sequence is developed. Two definitions allow to determine the occurrence probabilities of X motifs and the circular codes X, and being a circular permutation map applied on X) in a population of tRNAs. This approach identifies X motifs in the 5′ and/or 3′ regions of 16 isoaccepting tRNAs (except for the tRNAs Arg, His, Ser and Trp). The statistical analyses are performed on different and large tRNA populations according to the taxonomy (prokaryotes and eukaryotes), tRNA length and tRNA score. Finally, a circular code property observed in genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is identified in the 3′ regions of 19 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (except for the tRNA Leu). of a possible translation (framing) code based on a circular code.
