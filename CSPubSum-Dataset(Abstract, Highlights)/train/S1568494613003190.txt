 In past, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) models desired to find an optimal alternative from numerous feasible alternatives under fuzzy environment. However, researches seldom focused on determination of criteria weights, although they were also important components for FMCDM. In fact, criteria weights can be computed through extending quality function deployment (QFD) under fuzzy environment, i.e. fuzzy quality function deployment (FQFD). By FQFD, customer demanded qualities expressing the opinions of customers and service development capabilities presenting the opinions of experts can be integrated into criteria weights for FMCDM. However, deriving criteria weights in FQFD may be complex and different to multiply two fuzzy numbers in real world. To resolve the tie, we will combine FQFD with relative preference relation on FMCDM problems. With the relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers, it is not necessary multiplying two fuzzy numbers to derive criteria weights in FQFD. Alternatively, adjusted criteria weights will substitute for original criteria weights through relative preference relation. Obviously, adjusted criteria weights are clearly determined and then utilized in FMCDM models.

@highlight We associate FQFD with relative preference relation to identify adjusted criteria weights in an FMCDM model.
@highlight By the adjusted criteria weights, we can avoid multiplying triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, aggregating multiplied fuzzy numbers, and ranking them.
@highlight Adjusted criteria weights substitutes for original criteria weights in FMCDM through relative preference relation, and thus adjusted criteria weights are useful to construct an FMCDM model.
