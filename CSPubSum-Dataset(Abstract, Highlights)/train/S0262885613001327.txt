 Building facade detection is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in mobile robotics and semantic scene understanding. In particular, mobile platform localization and guidance in urban environments can be enabled with accurate models of the various building facades in a scene. Toward that end, we present a system for detection, segmentation, and parameter estimation of building facades in stereo imagery. The proposed method incorporates multilevel appearance and disparity features in a binary discriminative model, and generates a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar models. These two models are incorporated into a two-layer Markov Random Field (MRF): an appearance- and disparity-based discriminative classifier at the mid-level, and a geometric model to segment the building pixels into facades at the high-level. By using object-specific stereo features, our discriminative classifier is able to achieve substantially higher accuracy than standard boosting or modeling with only appearance-based features. Furthermore, the results of our MRF classification indicate a strong improvement in accuracy for the binary building detection problem and the labeled planar surface models provide a good approximation to the ground truth planes.
