 User perceptions of website design (for Information Content, Information Design, Navigation Design, Visual Design), Website Trust, and Transaction Security are examined for differences in an eight country sample. Motivation for the investigation includes:  to test and compare user reactions to website design in countries with different degrees of uncertainty avoidance,  to consider user reactions based on country economic and technological conditions related to the theory of institutional trust and social capital, and  to extend clustering theory and the GLOBE cultural cluster model to determine if culturally similar countries group regarding user perceptions of websites. Overall and as predicted, users in low uncertainty avoidance, high institutional trust and social capital countries such as Canada and the USA have the most favorable perceptions of website design. An interesting finding is that while country economic and technological conditions may temper user perceptions in some instances, overall culture is a stronger predictor. Clustering theory is a useful determinant of user perceptions, and there is strong support that users within a given cultural cluster have similar requirements regarding website design.

@highlight Website design elements, trust, and transaction security are examined across 8 countries.
@highlight Cultural values such as uncertainty avoidance are important for user design perceptions.
@highlight Country economic and technological conditions temper use perceptions.
@highlight Clustering theory is extended to website design affording insights to website localization.
