 A gene regulatory network (GRN) is a large and complex network consisting of interacting elements that, over time, affect each otherâ€™s state. The dynamics of complex gene regulatory processes are difficult to understand using intuitive approaches alone. To overcome this problem, we propose an algorithm for inferring the regulatory interactions from knock-out data using a Gaussian model combines with Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). There are several problems relating to GRN construction that have been outlined in this paper. We demonstrated the ability of our proposed method to  predict the presence of regulatory interactions between genes,  their directionality and  their states (activation or suppression). The algorithm was applied to network sizes of 10 and 50 genes from DREAM3 datasets and network sizes of 10 from DREAM4 datasets. The predicted networks were evaluated based on AUROC and AUPR. We discovered that high false positive values were generated by our GRN prediction methods because the indirect regulations have been wrongly predicted as true relationships. We achieved satisfactory results as the majority of sub-networks achieved AUROC values above 0.5.

@highlight A method to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from knock-out data is proposed.
@highlight The proposed method apply Normal Distributions and Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
@highlight Indirect regulations generate many false positives.
@highlight Most of the false negatives are mostly due to multiple genes input.
