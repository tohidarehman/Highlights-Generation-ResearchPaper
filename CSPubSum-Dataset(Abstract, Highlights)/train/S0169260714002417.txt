 Proteins control all biological functions in living species. Protein structure is comprised of four major classes including all-α class, all-β class, α+β, and α/β. Each class performs different function according to their nature. Owing to the large exploration of protein sequences in the databanks, the identification of protein structure classes is difficult through conventional methods with respect to cost and time. Looking at the importance of protein structure classes, it is thus highly desirable to develop a computational model for discriminating protein structure classes with high accuracy. For this purpose, we propose a silco method by incorporating Pseudo Average Chemical Shift and Support Vector Machine. Two feature extraction schemes namely Pseudo Amino Acid Composition and Pseudo Average Chemical Shift are used to explore valuable information from protein sequences. The performance of the proposed model is assessed using four benchmark datasets , 640 and 399 employing jackknife test. The success rates of the proposed model are 84.2%, 85.0%, 86.4%, and 89.2%, respectively on the four datasets. The empirical results reveal that the performance of our proposed model compared to existing models is promising in the literature so far and might be useful for future research.
