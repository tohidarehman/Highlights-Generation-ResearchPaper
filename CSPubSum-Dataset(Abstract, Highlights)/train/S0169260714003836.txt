 Neuropsychological assessment tests have an important role in early detection of dementia. Therefore, we designed and implemented a test battery for mobile devices that can be used for mobile cognitive screening (MCS). This battery consists of 33 questions from 14 type of tests for the assessment of 8 different cognitive functions: Arithmetic, orientation, abstraction, attention, memory, language, visual, and executive functions. This test battery is implemented as an application for mobile devices that operates on Android OS. In order to validate the effectiveness of the neuropsychological test battery, it was applied on a group of 23 elderly persons. Within this group, 9 (of age 81.78±4.77) were healthy and 14 (of age 72.55±9.95) were already diagnosed with dementia. The education level of the control group (healthy) and dementia group were comparable as they spent 13.66±5.07 and 13.71±4.14 years at school respectively. For comparison, a validated paper-and-pencil test (Montreal Cognitive Test – MoCA) was applied along with the proposed MCS battery. The proposed test was able to differentiate the individuals in the control and dementia groups for executive, visual, memory, attention, orientation functions with statistical significance (p <0.05). Results of the remaining functions; language, abstraction, and arithmetic were statistically insignificant (p >0.05). The results of MCS and MoCA were compared, and the scores of individuals from these tests were correlated (r =0.57).

@highlight A novel mobile cognitive screening (MCS) test is designed for mobile devices.
@highlight MCS has easier interface for elderly participants compared to the personal computers.
@highlight MCS can offer a wider range of multimedia components compared to the paper tests.
@highlight MCS can compare cognitive functions against the average of healthy individuals'.
@highlight MCS can differentiate healthy and impaired cognitive abilities.
