 Since 3D measurement technologies have been widely used in manufacturing industries edge detection in a depth image plays an important role in computer vision applications. In this paper, we have proposed an edge detection process in a depth image based on the image based smoothing and morphological operations. In this method we have used the principle of Median filtering, which has a renowned feature for edge preservation properties. The edge detection was done based on Canny Edge detection principle and was improvised with morphological operations, which are represented as combinations of erosion and dilation. Later, we compared our results with some existing methods and exhibited that this method produced better results. However, this method works in multiframe applications with effective framerates. Thus this technique will aid to detect edges robustly from depth images and contribute to promote applications in depth images such as object detection, object segmentation, etc.

@highlight A method is proposed that can detect edges from depth images more profoundly.
@highlight We modified the Canny edge detection method using morphological operations.
@highlight The proposed method works in multi-frames.
