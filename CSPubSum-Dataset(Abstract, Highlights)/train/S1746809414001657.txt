 This paper proposes adaptive schemes to cope with time-related changes in muscle activities during playing video game. A myoelectric control with the core of support vector machine is applied to manipulate a car in a computer-based video game. The proposed adaptive schemes model fatigue-based changes in myoelectric signals and modify the classification criteria to keep stable performance in long-term operations. Both unsupervised and supervised methods were applied to detect time-related steady state deviations in myoelectric signal patterns. Both methods improve the performance of myoelectric control and keep it stable in long-term applications.
