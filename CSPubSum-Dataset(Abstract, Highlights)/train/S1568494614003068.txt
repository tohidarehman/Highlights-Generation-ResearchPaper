 In this study, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used for multi-criteria decision making in supplier evaluation and selection problem. The contemporary supply-chain management is looking for both quantitative and qualitative measures other than just getting the lowest price. After evaluating a number of distinct suppliers, determining the reliable suppliers by ANFIS model with better approximation will support decision makers. To this end, ANFIS is evaluated for different data sets with the attributes of the suppliers and their scores that are gathered from a previous study conducted for the same problem under the name of Neural Network (NN) application for fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making model. In the proposed ANFIS model built for determining supplier score, linear regression analysis (R-value) and Mean Square Error (MSE) were 0.8467 and 0.0134, respectively, while they were 0.7733 and 0.0193 for NN for fuzzy. ANFIS gives better results according to MSEs. Hence, it is determined that ANFIS algorithm can be used in multi-criteria decision making problems for supplier evaluation and selection with more precise and reliable results.

@highlight Multi-criteria decision making model is established for supplier evaluation and selection problem.
@highlight Neural Networks (NN) for fuzzy multi criteria decision making and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models are compared for multi-criteria decision making in supplier evaluation and selection problem solution.
@highlight ANFIS model increases residual and reduces Means Squared Error (MSE) compare to the NN solution model.
