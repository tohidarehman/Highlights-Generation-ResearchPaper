 Experimental and clinical studies have shown that beat-to-beat variability of ventricular repolarization morphology, which can be measured by T-wave spectral variance (TSV) index based on the two-dimensional Fourier transform, is associated with an increased risk of developing malignant ventricular arrhythmias. In the present study we tested TSV index during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure in the 12 standard ECG leads and in the orthogonal and leads. In addition, we analyzed the intrasubject and intersubject variability of TSV index, in order to determine reliable limits of significant repolarization variability due to an ischemic cardiac process. A total population of 62 patients, in which two ECG controls and one ECG recording during PCI procedure, were obtained. Results indicate that TSV index showed significant differences during PCI procedure with respect to control situation in all ECG leads ( 0.0001 ). The relative change between PCI procedure and control situation showed that there is a preferential ECG lead to analyze the TSV index depending on the occlusion site. Moreover, TSV index presented a high stability in each patient and a significant larger variability among patients. Finally, we conclude that TSV index offers a robust tool for evaluating beat-to-beat repolarization variability during acute myocardial ischemia.
