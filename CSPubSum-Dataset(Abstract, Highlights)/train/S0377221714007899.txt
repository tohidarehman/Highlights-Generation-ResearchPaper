 We introduce a new preference disaggregation modeling formulations for multiple criteria sorting with a set of additive value functions. The preference information supplied by the Decision Maker (DM) is composed of:  possibly imprecise assignment examples,  desired class cardinalities, and  assignment-based pairwise comparisons. The latter have the form of imprecise statements referring to the desired assignments for pairs of alternatives, but without specifying any concrete class. Additionally, we account for preferences concerning the shape of the marginal value functions and desired comprehensive values of alternatives assigned to a given class or class range. The exploitation of all value functions compatible with these preferences results in three types of results:  necessary and possible assignments,  extreme class cardinalities, and  necessary and possible assignment-based preference relations. These outputs correspond to different types of admitted preference information. By exhibiting different outcomes, we encourage the DM in various ways to enrich her/his preference information interactively. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated on data involving the classification of cities into liveability classes.
