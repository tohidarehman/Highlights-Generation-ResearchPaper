 This study investigates impacts of oxygen flow during the deposition of amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO) channel layer with a radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputter on the electrical characteristics of the fabricated thin-film transistors (TFTs). Results indicate that as the film was deposited with a higher oxygen flow, the transfer curves are positively shifted while the field-effect mobility (μ FE) is significantly decreased. To get more insight about the effects, channel resistance (R CH) and the parasitic source-to-drain resistance (R SD) of the fabricated devices are extracted using the total resistance method. The extracted a-IGZO channel resistance per unit length (r ch) and RSD are found to increase while the extracted effective mobility (μE ) is decreased with increasing oxygen flow during sputtering. These observations are postulated to be related the decrease in the In/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio and the increase in the Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio of the a-IGZO films with increasing the oxygen flow rate which lead to higher resistivity and lower carrier concentration. The extracted RSD can be comparable with R CH for the devices prepared with high oxygen flow, resulting in the roll-off of μ FE as the channel length is shorter than 20μm.
