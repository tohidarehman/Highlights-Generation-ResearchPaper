 This paper examines the research patterns and trends of Recommendation System (RecSys) in China during the period of 2004â€“2013. Data (keywords in articles) was collected from the China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (CAJD) and the China Science Periodical Database (CSPD). A co-word analysis was conducted to measure correlation among the extracted keywords. The cluster analysis and social network analysis revealed 12 theme-clusters, network characteristics (centrality and density) of the clusters, the strategic diagram, and the correlation network. The study results show that there are several important themes with a high correlation in Chinese RecSys research, which is considered to be relatively focused, mature, and well-developed overall. Some research themes have developed on a considerable scale, while others remain isolated and undeveloped. This study also identified a few emerging themes with great potential for development. It was also determined that studies overall on the applications of RecSys are increasing.

@highlight We examine RecSys studies in China quantitatively, empirically, and longitudinally.
@highlight Research on RecSys is relatively mature and well-developed overall.
@highlight Twelve theme-clusters and six larger branches are identified.
@highlight Some undeveloped or immature research themes continue to persist.
@highlight Emerging themes with great potential for development are also identified.
