 The paper addresses structural decomposition of images by using a family of non-linear and non-convex objective functions. These functions rely on â„“ quasi-norm estimation costs in a piecewise constant regularization framework. These objectives make image decomposition into constant cartoon levels and rich textural patterns possible. The paper shows that these regularizing objectives yield image texture-versus-cartoon decompositions that cannot be reached by using standard penalized least square regularizations associated with smooth and convex objectives.

@highlight The paper provides a family of non-smooth and non-convex regularizing objectives.
@highlight These objectives operate image structural cartoon-versus-texture image differencing.
@highlight These objectives reach high level cartooning with piecewise constant edge transitions.
@highlight From these objectives, segmentation can be seen as instance of image regularization.
