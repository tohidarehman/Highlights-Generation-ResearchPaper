 The main constraint of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the limited and generally irreplaceable power source of the sensor nodes. Therefore, designing energy saving routing algorithm is one of the most focused research issues. In this paper, we propose an energy aware routing algorithm for cluster based WSNs. The algorithm is based on a clever strategy of cluster head (CH) selection, residual energy of the CHs and the intra-cluster distance for cluster formation. To facilitate data routing, a directed virtual backbone of CHs is constructed which is rooted at the sink. The proposed algorithm is also shown to balance energy consumption of the CHs during data routing process. We prove that the algorithm achieves constant message and linear time complexity. We test the proposed algorithm extensively. The experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms other existing algorithms in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption and other parameters.
