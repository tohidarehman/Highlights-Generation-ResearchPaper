 Hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR) contains much more comprehensive information than the traditional multiplicative preference relations. The HMPR is a useful tool to help the decision makers express their preferences in group decision making under uncertainty. The key of group decision making with the HMPR is to derive the priority weights from the HMPR. Thus, an efficient and practical priority method should be put forward so as to ensure the reasonability of the final decision result. In order to do that, in this paper, we first introduce the expected value and the geometric average value of hesitant multiplicative element (HME) which is the component of the HMPR. Then from different perspectives, we utilize the error-analysis technique to put forward three novel methods for the priorities of the HMPR, i.e., the expectation value method, the geometric average value method, and the multiplicative deviation method. We also investigate the relationships among these methods, and develop an approach to group decision making with the HMPR by using the methods and the possibility degree formula. Finally, by constructing the indicator system for credit risk evaluation of supply chain enterprises, we make a detailed case study concerning Lu-Zhou-Lao-Jiao (the well-known liquor enterprise in China) to demonstrate our approach.
