 In this paper, we address a multi-activity tour scheduling problem with time varying demand. The objective is to compute a team schedule for a fixed roster of employees in order to minimize the over-coverage and the under-coverage of different parallel activity demands along a planning horizon of one week. Numerous complicating constraints are present in our problem: all employees are different and can perform several different activities during the same day-shift, lunch breaks and pauses are flexible, demand is given for 15 minutes periods. Employees have feasibility and legality rules to be satisfied, but the objective function does not account for any quality measure associated with each individualâ€™s schedule. More precisely, the problem mixes simultaneously days-off scheduling, shift scheduling, shift assignment, activity assignment, pause and lunch break assignment. To solve this problem, we developed four methods: a compact Mixed Integer Linear Programming model, a branch-and-price like approach with a nested dynamic program to solve heuristically the subproblems, a diving heuristic and a greedy heuristic based on our subproblem solver. The computational results, based on both real cases and instances derived from real cases, demonstrate that our methods are able to provide good quality solutions in a short computing time. Our algorithms are now embedded in a commercial software, which is already in use in a mini-mart company.

@highlight We solve a real-life employee scheduling problem with a large number of constraints.
@highlight We show how an efficient dynamic program can be used to generate valid plannings.
@highlight We show that our method is efficient for solving real-life instances.
@highlight We experimentally compare the effectiveness of a greedy heuristic with a diving heuristic.
