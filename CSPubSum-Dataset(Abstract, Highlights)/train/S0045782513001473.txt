 We propose a new hybrid algorithm for incompressible micro and nanoflows that applies to non-isothermal steady-state flows and does not require the calculation of the Irvingâ€“Kirkwood stress tensor or heat flux vector. The method is validated by simulating the flow in a channel under the effect of a gravity-like force with bounding walls at two different temperatures and velocities. The model shows very accurate results compared to benchmark full MD simulations. In the temperature results, in particular, the contribution of viscous dissipation is correctly evaluated.

@highlight An atomistic-continuum hybrid model for incompressible fluids is proposed.
@highlight The model handles both momentum and heat transfer.
@highlight Comparison with full-MD benchmarks is very good.
@highlight For large geometries, the computational savings are large.
@highlight Three methods for drastically reducing numerical noise are proposed.
