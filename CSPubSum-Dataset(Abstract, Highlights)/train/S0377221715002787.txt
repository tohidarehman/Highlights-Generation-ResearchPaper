 We show that a number of scheduling problems with competing agents and earliness minimization objectives are equivalent to the corresponding problems with tardiness minimization objectives.

@highlight We revisit single-machine two-agent problems with earliness measures.
@highlight We show their equivalency with tardiness problems.
@highlight The earliness results can be derived from known tardiness results.
