 Due to the complexity and uncertainty in the process, the soft computing methods such as regression analysis, neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), fuzzy logic and multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) are preferred over physics-based models for predicting the process performance. The model participating in the evolutionary stage of the MGGP method is a linear weighted sum of several genes (model trees) regressed using the least squares method. In this combination mechanism, the occurrence of gene of lower performance in the MGGP model can degrade its performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified-MGGP (M-MGGP) method using a stepwise regression approach such that the genes of lower performance are eliminated and only the high performing genes are combined. In this work, the M-MGGP method is applied in modelling the surface roughness in the turning of hardened AISI H11 steel. The results show that the M-MGGP model produces better performance than those of MGGP, SVR and ANN. In addition, when compared to that of MGGP method, the models formed from the M-MGGP method are of smaller size. Further, the parametric and sensitivity analysis conducted validates the robustness of our proposed model and is proved to capture the dynamics of the turning phenomenon of AISI H11 steel by unveiling dominant input process parameters and the hidden non-linear relationships.
