 Conventional particle filtering-based visual ego-motion estimation or visual odometry often suffers from large local linearization errors in the case of abrupt camera motion. The main contribution of this paper is to present a novel particle filtering-based visual ego-motion estimation algorithm that is especially robust to the abrupt camera motion. The robustness to the abrupt camera motion is achieved by multi-layered importance sampling via particle swarm optimization (PSO), which iteratively moves particles to higher likelihood region without local linearization of the measurement equation. Furthermore, we make the proposed visual ego-motion estimation algorithm in real-time by reformulating the conventional vector space PSO algorithm in consideration of the geometry of the special Euclidean group SE, which is a Lie group representing the space of 3-D camera poses. The performance of our proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated and compared with the local linearization and unscented particle filter-based visual ego-motion estimation algorithms on both simulated and real data sets.
