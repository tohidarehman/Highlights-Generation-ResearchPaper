 This paper proposes relaxed conditions for control synthesis of discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy control systems under unreliable communication links. To widen the applicability of the fuzzy control approach under network environments, a novel fuzzy controller, which is homogenous polynomially parameter-dependent on both the current-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions and the multi-steps-past normalized fuzzy weighting functions, is provided to make much more use of the information of the underlying system. Moreover, a new kind of slack variable approach is also developed and thus the algebraic properties of these multi-instant normalized fuzzy weighting functions are collected into some augmented matrices. As a result, the conservatism of control synthesis of discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy control systems under unreliable communication links can be significantly reduced. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical development.

@highlight A novel fuzzy controller and a new kind of slack variable approach are developed.
@highlight The criterion takes the form of an LMI which is computationally tractable.
@highlight The obtained stabilization conditions are less conservative.
