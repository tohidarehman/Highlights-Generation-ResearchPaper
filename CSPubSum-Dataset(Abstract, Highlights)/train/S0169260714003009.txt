 This study was performed to evaluate the influences of the myocardial bridges on the plaque initializations and progression in the coronary arteries. The wall structure is changed due to the plaque presence, which could be the reason for multiple heart malfunctions. Using simplified parametric finite element model (FE model) of the coronary artery having myocardial bridge and analyzing different mechanical parameters from blood circulation through the artery (wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index, residence time), we investigated the prediction of “the best” position for plaque progression. We chose six patients from the angiography records and used data from DICOM images to generate FE models with our software tools for FE preprocessing, solving and post-processing. We found a good correlation between real positions of the plaque and the ones that we predicted to develop at the proximal part of the myocardial bridges with wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index and residence time. This computer model could be additional predictive tool for everyday clinical examination of the patient with myocardial bridge.
