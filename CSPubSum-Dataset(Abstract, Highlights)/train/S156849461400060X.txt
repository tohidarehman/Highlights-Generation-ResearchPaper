 In actuality, for example, the review of the National Science Foundation and the blind peer review of doctoral dissertation in China, the evaluation experts are requested to provide two types of information such as the performance of the evaluation objects and the familiarity with the evaluation areas (called confidence levels). However, existing information aggregation research achievements cannot be used to fusion the two types information described above effectively. In this paper, we focus on the information aggregation issue in the situation where there are confidence levels of the aggregated arguments under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Firstly, we develop some confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted aggregation operators, such as the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (CIFWA) operator and the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (CIFWG) operator. Then, based on the Einstein operations, we proposed the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging (CIFEWA) operator and the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted geometric (CIFEWG) operator. Finally, a practical example about the review of the doctoral dissertation in Chinese universities is provided to illustrate the developed intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation operators.
