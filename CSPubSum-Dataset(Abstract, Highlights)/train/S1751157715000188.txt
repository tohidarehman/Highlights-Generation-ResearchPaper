 The theoretical approach of the mathematical model of Social Gestalts and the corresponding methods for the 3-D visualization and animation of collaboration networks are presented in Part I. The application of these new methods to male and female networks is shown in Part II. After regression analysis the visualized Social Gestalts are rather identically with the corresponding empirical distributions (R >0.99). The structures of female co-authorship networks differ markedly from the structures of the male co-authorship networks. For female co-author pairsÃ¢ÂÂ networks, accentuation of productivity dissimilarities of the pairs is becoming visible but on the contrary, for male co-author pairsÃ¢ÂÂ networks, accentuation of productivity similarities of the pairs is expressed.
