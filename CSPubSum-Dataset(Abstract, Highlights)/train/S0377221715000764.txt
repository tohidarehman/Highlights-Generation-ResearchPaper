 This paper presents a discrete-time single-server finite-buffer queue with Markovian arrival process and generally distributed batch-size-dependent service time. Given that infinite service time is not commonly encountered in practical situations, we suppose that the distribution of the service time has a finite support. Recently, a similar continuous-. But unfortunately, their method is hard to apply in the analysis of discrete-time case with versatile Markovian point process due to the fact that the difference equation governing the boundary state probabilities is more complex than the continuous one. If we follow their ideas, we will eventually find that some important joint queue length distributions cannot be computed and thus some key performance measures cannot be derived. In this paper, replacing the finite support renewal distribution with an appropriate phase-type distribution, the joint state probabilities at various time epochs (arbitrary, pre-arrival and departure) have been obtained by using matrix analytic method and embedded Markov chain technique. Furthermore, UL-type RG-factorization is employed in numerical computation of block-structured Markov chains with finitely-many levels. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm for several service time distributions. Moreover, the impact of the correlation factor on loss probability and mean sojourn time is also investigated.
