 We present a variational framework for naturally incorporating prior shape knowledge in guidance of active contours for boundary extraction in images. This framework is especially suitable for images collected outside the visible spectrum, where boundary estimation is difficult due to low contrast, low resolution, and presence of noise and clutter. Accordingly, we illustrate this approach using the segmentation of various objects in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images of underwater terrains. We use elastic shape analysis of planar curves in which the shapes are considered as elements of a quotient space of an infinite dimensional, non-linear Riemannian manifold. Using geodesic paths under the elastic Riemannian metric, one computes sample mean and covariances of training shapes in each classes and derives statistical models for capturing class-specific shape variability. These models are then used as shape priors in a variational setting to solve for Bayesian estimation of desired contours as follows. In traditional active contour models curves are driven towards minimum of an energy composed of image and smoothing terms. We introduce an additional shape term based on shape models of relevant shape classes. The minimization of this total energy, using iterated gradient-based updates of curves, leads to an improved segmentation of object boundaries. This is demonstrated using a number of shape classes in two large SAS image datasets.

@highlight SAS imagery exhibits high levels of background noise and ambiguous target boundaries.
@highlight Segmentation algorithms without prior shape knowledge typically fail.
@highlight We model shapes as elements of a Riemannian manifold with an elastic metric.
@highlight Such elastic shape models serve as shape priors in a Bayesian active contour model.
@highlight We show improvement in boundary segmentation with shape prior versus without prior.
