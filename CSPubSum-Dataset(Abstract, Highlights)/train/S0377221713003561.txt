 We address a truck scheduling problem that arises in intermodal container transportation, where containers need to be transported between customers (shippers or receivers) and container terminals (rail or maritime) and vice versa. The transportation requests are handled by a trucking company which operates several depots and a fleet of homogeneous trucks that must be routed and scheduled to minimize the total truck operating time under hard time window constraints imposed by the customers and terminals. Empty containers are considered as transportation resources and are provided by the trucking company for freight transportation. The truck scheduling problem at hand is formulated as Full-Truckload Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (FTPDPTW) and is solved by a 2-stage heuristic solution approach. This solution method was specially designed for the truck scheduling problem but can be applied to other problems as well. We assess the quality of our solution approach on several computational experiments.

@highlight We introduce the first modeling as full truckload pickup and delivery problem with time windows.
@highlight Additionally to the routing, empty containers are assigned for freight transportation.
@highlight The objective aims at minimizing the total truck operating time.
@highlight The two-stage heuristic is currently the fastest and most efficient solution method.
