 Plane model extraction from three-dimensional point clouds is a necessary step in many different applications such as planar object reconstruction, indoor mapping and indoor localization. Different RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC)-based methods have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. In this study, we propose a novel method-based on RANSAC called Multiplane Model Estimation, which can estimate multiple plane models simultaneously from a noisy point cloud using the knowledge extracted from a scene (or an object) in order to reconstruct it accurately. This method comprises two steps: first, it clusters the data into planar faces that preserve some constraints defined by knowledge related to the object (e.g., the angles between faces); and second, the models of the planes are estimated based on these data using a novel multi-constraint RANSAC. We performed experiments in the clustering and RANSAC stages, which showed that the proposed method performed better than state-of-the-art methods.

@highlight A novel method for planar model reconstruction from three dimensional point cloud.
@highlight It allows the accurate reconstruction of planar objects using prior knowledge.
@highlight It evaluates the clusters of each face and estimates the planes by using constraints.
@highlight k-means estimates the clusters and a tree search refine them by using constraints.
@highlight It extends RANSAC introducing a step to evaluate if the inliers comply constraints.
