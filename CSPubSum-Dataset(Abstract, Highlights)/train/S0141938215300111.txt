 This paper presents a new bi-side gate driver integrated by indium-zinc-oxide thin film transistors (IZO TFTs). Our optimized operate method can achieve high speed performance by employing a lower duty ratio (25%) CK2 with its pulse located in the middle of the pulse of CK2L to fully use the bootstrapped high voltage of node Q. In addition, the size of devices is optimized by calculation and simulation, and the function of the proposed gate driver is predicted by the circuit simulation. Furthermore, the proposed gate driver with 20 stages is fabricated by the IZO TFTs process. It is shown that a 2.6μs width pulse with good noise-suppressed characteristic can be successfully output at the condition of R load =6kΩ and C load =150pF. The power consumption of the proposed gate driver with 20 stages is measured as 1mW. Hence, the proposed gate driver may be applied to the display of 4K resolution  at a frame rate of 120Hz. Moreover, there is a good stability for the proposed gate driver under 48h operation.
