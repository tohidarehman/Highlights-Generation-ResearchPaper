 In this paper, we propose fuzzy logic-based cooperative reinforcement learning for sharing knowledge among autonomous robots. The ultimate goal of this paper is to entice bio-insects towards desired goal areas using artificial robots without any human aid. To achieve this goal, we found an interaction mechanism using a specific odor source and performed simulations and experiments . For efficient learning without human aid, we employ cooperative reinforcement learning in multi-agent domain. Additionally, we design a fuzzy logic-based expertise measurement system to enhance the learning ability. This structure enables the artificial robots to share knowledge while evaluating and measuring the performance of each robot. Through numerous experiments, the performance of the proposed learning algorithms is evaluated.

@highlight We present a cooperative reinforcement learning technique using a fuzzy logic-based expertise measurement system to entice bio-insects towards desired goal areas.
@highlight We address the fuzzy logic-based expertise measurement system for sharing knowledge among the robots.
@highlight We conduct two experiments. In the first experiment, the robots entice the bio-insect without sharing knowledge, while in the second experiment, the robots entice the bio-insect with sharing knowledge. The second experiment shows better results than the first experiment.
@highlight From the experiments, we can conclude that sharing knowledge using fuzzy-logic-based expertise measurement system is an efficient way for our task.
