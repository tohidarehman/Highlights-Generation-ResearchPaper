 Nowadays, in the era of common computerization, transmission and reflection methods are intensively developed in addition to improving classical ultrasound methods (US) for imaging of tissue structure, in particular ultrasound transmission tomography UTT (analogous to computed tomography CT which uses X-rays) and reflection tomography URT (based on the synthetic aperture method used in radar imaging techniques). This paper presents and analyses the results of ultrasound transmission tomography imaging of the internal structure of the female breast biopsy phantom CIRS Model 052A and the results of the ultrasound reflection tomography imaging of a wire sample. Imaging was performed using a multi-modal ultrasound computerized tomography system developed with the participation of a private investor. The results were compared with the results of imaging obtained using dual energy CT, MR mammography and conventional US method. The obtained results indicate that the developed UTT and URT methods, after the acceleration of the scanning process, thus enabling in vivo examination, may be successfully used for detection and detailed characterization of breast lesions in women.

@highlight We designed the multi-modal ultrasound tomography system for breast diagnosis.
@highlight We present imaging results of a breast biopsy phantom structure and a wire sample.
@highlight We show quantitative transmission ultrasonic images and qualitative reflection ones.
@highlight We compare our method with CT, MR mammography and US with good result.
@highlight Our system can be used as diagnostic tool for breast screening in vivo.
