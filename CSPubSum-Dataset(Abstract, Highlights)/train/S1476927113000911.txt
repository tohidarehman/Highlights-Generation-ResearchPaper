 Exposure-response modeling and simulation is especially useful in oncology as it permits to predict and design un-experimented clinical trials as well as dose selection. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most effective immune cells in the regulation of immune system. To activate immune system, DCs may be matured by many factors like bacterial CpG-DNA, Lipopolysaccharaide (LPS) and other microbial products. In this paper, a model based on artificial neural network (ANN) is presented for analyzing the dynamics of antitumor vaccines using empirical data obtained from the experimentations of different groups of mice treated with DCs matured by bacterial CpG-DNA, LPS and whole lysate of a Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. Also, tumor lysate was added to DCs followed by addition of maturation factors. Simulations show that the proposed model can interpret the important features of empirical data. Owing to the nonlinearity properties, the proposed ANN model has been able not only to describe the contradictory empirical results, but also to predict new vaccination patterns for controlling the tumor growth. For example, the proposed model predicts an exponentially increasing pattern of CpG-matured DC to be effective in suppressing the tumor growth.
