 This paper introduces an efficient training algorithm for a dendrite morphological neural network (DMNN). Given p classes of patterns, C , k=1, 2, â€¦, p, the algorithm selects the patterns of all the classes and opens a hyper-cube HC (with n dimensions) with a size such that all the class elements remain inside HC . The size of HC can be chosen such that the border elements remain in some of the faces of HC , or can be chosen for a bigger size. This last selection allows the trained DMNN to be a very efficient classification machine in the presence of noise at the moment of testing, as we will see later. In a second step, the algorithm divides the HC into 2 smaller hyper-cubes and verifies if each hyper-cube encloses patterns for only one class. If this is the case, the learning process is stopped and the DMNN is designed. If at least one hyper-cube HC encloses patterns of more than one class, then HC is divided into 2 smaller hyper-cubes. The verification process is iteratively repeated onto each smaller hyper-cube until the stopping criterion is satisfied. At this moment the DMNN is designed. The algorithm was tested for benchmark problems and compare its performance against some reported algorithms, showing its superiority.
