 Video shot boundary detection (SBD) is a fundamental step in automatic video content analysis toward video indexing, summarization and retrieval. Despite the beneficial previous works in the literature, reliable detection of video shots is still a challenging issue with many unsolved problems. In this paper, we focus on the problem of hard cut detection and propose an automatic algorithm in order to accurately determine abrupt transitions from video. We suggest a fuzzy rule-based scene cut identification approach in which a set of fuzzy rules are evaluated to detect cuts. The main advantage of the proposed method is that, we incorporate spatial and temporal features to describe video frames, and model cut situations according to temporal dependency of video frames as a set of fuzzy rules. Also, while existing cut detection algorithms are mainly threshold dependent; our method identifies cut transitions using a fuzzy logic which is more flexible. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a variety of video sequences from different genres. Experimental results, in comparison with the most standard cut detection algorithms confirm our method is more robust to object and camera movements as well as illumination changes.
