 We present PrivHab+, a secure geographic routing protocol that learns about the mobility habits of the nodes of the network and uses this information in a secure manner. PrivHab+ is designed to operate in areas that lack of network, using the store-carry-and-forward approach. PrivHab+ compares nodes and chooses the best choice to carry messages towards a known geographical location. To achieve a high performance and low overhead, PrivHab+ uses information about the usual whereabouts of the nodes to make optimal routing decisions. PrivHab+ makes use of cryptographic techniques from secure multi-party computation to preserve nodes’ privacy while taking routing decisions. The overhead introduced by PrivHab+ is evaluated using a proof-of-concept implementation, and its performance is studied under the scope of a realistic application of podcast distribution. PrivHab+ is compared, through simulation, with a set of well-known delay-tolerant routing algorithms in two different scenarios of remote rural areas.
