 Searching novel, safe and effective anti-inflammatory agents has remained an evolving research enquiry in the mainstream of inflammatory disorders. In the present investigation series of thiazoles bearing pyrazole as a possible pharmacophore were synthesized and assessed for their anti inflammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo methods. In order to decipher the possible anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of the synthesized compounds, cyclooxygenase I and II (COX-I and COX-II) inhibition assays were also carried out. The results obtained clearly focus the significance of compounds 5d, 5h and 5i as selective COX-II inhibitors. Moreover, compound 5h was also identified as a lead molecule for inhibition of the carrageenin induced rat paw edema in animal model studies. Molecular docking results revealed significant interactions of the test compounds with the active site of COX-II, which perhaps can be explored for design and development of novel COX-II selective anti-inflammatory agents.
