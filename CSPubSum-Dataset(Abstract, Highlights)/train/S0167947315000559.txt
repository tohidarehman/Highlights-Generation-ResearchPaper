 The asymmetry in the tail dependence between U.S. equity portfolios and the aggregate U.S. market is a well-established property. Given the limited number of observations in the tails of a joint distribution, standard non-parametric measures of tail dependence have poor finite-sample properties and generally reject the asymmetry in the tail dependence. A parametric model, based on a multivariate noncentral t distribution, is developed to measure and test asymmetry in tail dependence. This model allows different levels of tail dependence to be estimated depending on the distributionâ€™s parameters and accommodates situations in which the volatilities or the correlations across returns are time varying. For most of the size, book-to-market, and momentum portfolios, the tail dependence with the market portfolio is significantly higher on the downside than on the upside.

@highlight The tail dependence between US equity portfolios and the US market is asymmetric.
@highlight We describe a multivariate t distribution with asymmetry in the lower and upper tail dependence.
@highlight The lower and upper tail dependence parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood.
@highlight The estimated tail dependence parameters are consistent with the data provided volatilities and correlations are allowed to vary over time.
