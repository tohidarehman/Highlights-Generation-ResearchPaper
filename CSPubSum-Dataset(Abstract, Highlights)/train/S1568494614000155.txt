 This paper first proposes a type-2 neural fuzzy system (NFS) learned through its type-1 counterpart (T2NFS-T1) and then implements the built IT2NFS-T1 in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. The antecedent part of each fuzzy rule in the T2NFS-T1 uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets, while the consequent part uses a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type with interval combination weights. The T2NFS-T1 uses a simplified type-reduction operation to reduce system training time and hardware implementation cost. Given a training data set, a TSK type-1 NFS is first learned through structure and parameter learning. The built type-1 fuzzy logic system (FLS) is then extended to a type-2 FLS, where highly overlapped type-1 fuzzy sets are merged into interval type-2 fuzzy sets to reduce the total number of fuzzy sets. Finally, the rule consequent and antecedent parameters in the T2NFS-T1 are tuned using a hybrid of the gradient descent and rule-ordered recursive least square (RLS) algorithms. Simulation results and comparisons with various type-1 and type-2 FLSs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the T2NFS-T1 for system modeling and prediction problems. A new hardware circuit using both parallel-processing and pipeline techniques is proposed to implement the learned T2NFS-T1 in an FPGA chip. The T2NFS-T1 chip reduces the hardware implementation cost in comparison to other type-2 fuzzy chips.
