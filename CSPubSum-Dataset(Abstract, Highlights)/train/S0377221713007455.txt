 We explore the effect of balancing unbalanced panel data when estimating primal productivity indices using non-parametric frontier estimators. First, we list a series of pseudo-solutions aimed at making an unbalanced panel balanced. Then, we discuss some intermediate solutions (e.g., balancing 2-years by 2years). Furthermore, we link this problem with a variety of literatures on infeasibilities, statistical inference of non-parametric frontier estimators, and the index theory literature focusing on the dynamics of entry and exit in industries. We then empirically illustrate these issues comparing both Malmquist and Hicks–Moorsteen productivity indices on two data sets. In particular, we test for the differences in distribution when comparing balanced and unbalanced results for a given index and when comparing Malmquist and Hicks–Moorsteen productivity indices for a given type of data set. The latter tests are crucial in answering the question to which extent the Malmquist index can approximate the Hicks–Moorsteen index that has a Total Factor Productivity (TFP) interpretation. Finally, we draw up a list of remaining issues that could benefit from further exploration.
