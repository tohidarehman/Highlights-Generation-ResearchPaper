 In this paper, a combination of type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) and a conventional feedback controller (CFC) has been designed for the load frequency control (LFC) of a nonlinear time-delay power system. In this approach, the T2FLS controller which is designed to overcome the uncertainties and nonlinearites of the controlled system is in the feedforward path and the CFC which plays an important role in the transient state is in the feedback path. A Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional has been used to ensure the stability of the system and the parameter adjustment laws for the T2FLS controller are derived using this functional. In this training method, the effect of delay has been considered in tuning the T2FLS controller parameters and thus the performance of the system has been improved. The T2FLS controller is used due to its ability to effectively model uncertainties, which may exist in the rules and data measured by the sensors. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a two-area nonlinear time-delay power system has been used and compared with the controller that uses the gradient-descend (GD) algorithm to tune the T2FLS controller parameters.
