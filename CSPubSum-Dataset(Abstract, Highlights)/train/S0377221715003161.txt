 The recently published equilibrium efficient frontier data envelopment analysis (EEFDEA) approach  represents a step forward in evaluating decision-making units (DMUs) with fixed-sum outputs when compared to prior approaches such as FSODEA (fixed-sum outputs DEA) approach  and ZSG-DEA (zero sum gains DEA) approach  and so on. Based on the EEFDEA approach, in this paper, we proposed a generalized equilibrium efficient frontier data envelopment analysis approach (GEEFDEA) which improves and strengthens the EEFDEA approach. Compared to EEFDEA approach, this approach makes several improvements in evaluation, namely that  it is not necessary to determine the evaluation order in advance, which overcomes the limitation that different evaluation orders will lead to different results;  the equilibrium efficient frontier can be achieved in only one step no matter how many DMUs they are, which greatly simplifies the procedure to reach the equilibrium efficient frontier especially when the number of DMUs is large; and  the constraint that signs of outputsâ€™ adjustment of each DMU must be same (all non-positive or all non-negative) in prior approaches has been relaxed. In this sense, the result obtained by the proposed approach is more consistent with the demand of practical applications. Finally, the proposed approach combined with assurance regions (AR) is applied to the data set of 2012 London Olympic Games.

@highlight The proposed approach can achieve an equilibrium efficient frontier only by one step.
@highlight Our method relaxes the constraint that the same signs should be imposed on outputs' adjustments.
@highlight It is not necessary to determine the evaluation order in advance by our method.
@highlight Our method maintains all advantages of EEFDEA method.
@highlight Our method with an assurance region is firstly applied to evaluate London Olympics.
