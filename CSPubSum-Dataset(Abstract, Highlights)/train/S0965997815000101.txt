 With the accuracy limitation of some transfer methods in the self-parallel fluidâ€“structure interfaces, a data transfer method is proposed by an ISOMAP (Isometric Mapping) nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Through this new method, the data transfer problem of the self-parallel interfaces is solved. Example of a 3D turbine blade shows that the proposed method can improve the transfer accuracy in the non-matching meshes.
