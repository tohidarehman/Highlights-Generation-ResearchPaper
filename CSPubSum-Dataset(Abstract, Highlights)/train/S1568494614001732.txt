 This paper proposes a novel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image segmentation algorithm based on the neutrosophic set (NS) and improved artificial bee colony (I-ABC) algorithm. In this algorithm, threshold value estimation is considered as a search procedure that searches for a proper value in a grayscale interval. Therefore, I-ABC optimization algorithm is presented to search for the optimal threshold value. In order to get an efficient and powerful fitness function for I-ABC algorithm, the input SAR image is transformed into the NS domain. Then, a neutrosophic T and I subset images are obtained. A co-occurrence matrix based on the neutrosophic T and I subset images is constructed, and two-dimensional gray entropy function is described to serve as the fitness function of I-ABC algorithm. Finally, the optimal threshold value is quickly explored by the employed, onlookers and scouts bees in I-ABC algorithm. This paper contributes to SAR image segmentation in two aspects:  a hybrid model, having two different feature extraction methods, is proposed.  An optimal threshold value is automatically selected by maximizing the separability of the classes in gray level image by incorporating a simple and fast search strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by application to real SAR images.
