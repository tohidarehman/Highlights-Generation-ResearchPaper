 Conventional machine learning methods such as neural network (NN) uses empirical risk minimization (ERM) based on infinite samples, which is disadvantageous to the gait learning control based on small sample sizes for biped robots walking in unstructured, uncertain and dynamic environments. Aiming at the stable walking control problem in the dynamic environments for biped robots, this paper puts forward a method of gait control based on support vector machines (SVM), which provides a solution for the learning control issue based on small sample sizes. The SVM is equipped with a mixed kernel function for the gait learning. Using ankle trajectory and hip trajectory as inputs, and the corresponding trunk trajectory as outputs, the SVM is trained based on small sample sizes to learn the dynamic kinematics relationships between the legs and the trunk of the biped robots. Robustness of the gait control is enhanced, which is propitious to realize the stable biped walking, and the proposed method shows superior performance when compared to SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernels and polynomial kernels, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods.
