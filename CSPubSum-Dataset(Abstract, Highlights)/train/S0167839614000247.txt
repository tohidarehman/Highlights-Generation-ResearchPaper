 This paper describes the application of a structure-preserving matrix method to the deconvolution of two Bernstein basis polynomials. Specifically, the deconvolution yields a polynomial provided the exact polynomial is a divisor of the exact polynomial and all computations are performed symbolically. In practical situations, however, inexact forms, h and f of, respectively, and are specified, in which case is a rational function and not a polynomial. The simplest method to calculate the coefficients of g is the least squares minimisation of an over-determined system of linear equations in which the coefficient matrix is Tœplitz, but the solution is a polynomial approximation of a rational function. It is shown in this paper that an improved result for g is obtained when the Tœplitz structure of the coefficient matrix is preserved, that is, a structure-preserving matrix method is used. In particular, this method guarantees that a polynomial solution to the deconvolution is obtained, and thus an essential property of the theoretically exact solution is retained in the computed solution. Computational examples that show the improvement in the solution obtained from the structure-preserving matrix method with respect to the least squares solution are presented.
