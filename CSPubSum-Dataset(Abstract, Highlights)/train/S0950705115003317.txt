 It is necessary to provide a set of scientific foundations to support the emergency response management. The emergency response process are described based on the ideas from OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop theory. Pointing at the difficulty in the described the cooperation in the emergency response process, the coupled OODA framework is built to analyze the interaction between the emergency response units. In order to demonstrate the emergency response mechanism in theoretic way, the simulation theory of DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) is adopted to build up the simulator model of the basic OODA process framework. Utilize the coupled DEVS model to build the simulation coordinator of the coupled OODA process framework. The earthquake disaster response scenario in STAGE is built on the emergency response mechanism, and the emergency collaborative rescue process based on coupled OODA frameworks is adopted to build up the emergency response system, and the simulation results show reasonable.

@highlight Two kinds of emergency response frameworks are built based on OODA loop theory.
@highlight Describe the emergency response mechanism based on OODAâ€“DEVS theory model.
@highlight Emergency response system on earthquake is modeling and simulating based on the mentioned mechanism.
