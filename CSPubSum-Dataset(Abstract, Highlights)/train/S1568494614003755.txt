 This paper assesses effectiveness of dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) models in predicting the compressive strength of dry-cast concretes, and compares their prediction performances with those of regression, neural network (NN) and ANFIS models. The results of this study emphasized capabilities of online first-order and offline high-order Takagiâ€“Sugeno (TSK) type DENFIS models for prediction purposes, whereas offline first-order TSK-type DENFIS models did not produce reliable results. Comparison between the produced results of an elite high-order DENFIS model with those predicted by the selected NN, regression and ANFIS models showed effectiveness of DENFIS model than the regression model, while its performance was similar to or slightly better than the other artificial prediction tools.

@highlight For the first time, dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy system (DENFIS) was used to predict the compressive strength of dry-cast concretes.
@highlight For comparison purposes, 6 nonlinear regression, 6 neural network, 5 ANFIS, 3 online first-order TSK DENFIS, 3 offline first-order TSK DENFIS, and 3 offline high-order TSK DENFIS models were developed.
@highlight DENFIS model with high-order TSK inference system was found to be more robust than first-order TSK online and offline models.
@highlight High-order DENFIS model could be trained to produce more reliable prediction results in comparison with neural network, ANFIS and nonlinear regression models.
