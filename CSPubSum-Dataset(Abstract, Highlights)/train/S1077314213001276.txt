 In this paper, we present a new framework for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of multiple rigid objects from dynamic scenes. Conventional 3D reconstruction from multiple views is applicable to static scenes, in which the configuration of objects is fixed while the images are taken. In our framework, we aim to reconstruct the 3D models of multiple objects in a more general setting where the configuration of the objects varies among views. We solve this problem by object-centered decomposition of the dynamic scenes using unsupervised co-recognition approach. Unlike conventional motion segmentation algorithms that require small motion assumption between consecutive views, co-recognition method provides reliable accurate correspondences of a same object among unordered and wide-baseline views. In order to segment each object region, we benefit from the 3D sparse points obtained from the structure-from-motion. These points are reliable and serve as automatic seed points for a seeded-segmentation algorithm. Experiments on various real challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially in the presence of abrupt independent motions of objects.
