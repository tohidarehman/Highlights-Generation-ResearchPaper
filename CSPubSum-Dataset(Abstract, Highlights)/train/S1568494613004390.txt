 With respect to multiple attribute group decision making (MADM) problems in which attribute values take the form of intuitionistic linguistic numbers, some new group decision making methods are developed. Firstly, some operational laws, expected value, score function and accuracy function of intuitionistic linguistic numbers are introduced. Then, an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized weighted average (ILPGWA) operator and an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized ordered weighted average (ILPGOWA) operator are developed. Furthermore, some desirable properties of the ILPGWA and ILPGOWA operators, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity, etc. are studied. At the same time, some special cases of the generalized parameters in these operators are analyzed. Based on the ILPGWA and ILPGOWA operators, two approaches to multiple attribute group decision making with intuitionistic linguistic information are proposed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the developed approaches and to demonstrate their practicality and effectiveness.
