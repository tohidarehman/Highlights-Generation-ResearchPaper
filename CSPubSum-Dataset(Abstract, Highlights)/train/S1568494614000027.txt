 Nowadays, many healthcares are generating and collecting a huge amount of medical data. Due to the difficulty of analyzing this massive volume of data using traditional methods, medical data mining on Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been a major concern in medical research. Therefore, it is necessary to assess EHR architectures based on the capabilities of extracting useful medical knowledge from a huge amount of EHR databases. In this paper, we develop a bi-level interactive decision support framework to identify data mining-oriented EHR architectures. The contribution of this bi-level framework is fourfold:  it develops Interactive Simple Additive Weighting (ISAW) model from an individual single-level environment to a group bi-level environment;  it utilizes decision makersâ€™ preferences gradually in the course of interactions to reach to a consensus on an data mining-oriented EHR architecture;  it considers fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets to represent ambiguous, uncertain or imprecise information; and  it synthesizes a representative outcome based on qualitative and quantitative indicators in the EHR assessment process. A case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed bi-level interactive framework for benchmarking a national data mining-oriented EHR.
