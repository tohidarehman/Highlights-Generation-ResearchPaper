 The Choquet integral preference model is adopted in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) to deal with interactions between criteria, while the Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) is an MCDA methodology considered to take into account uncertainty or imprecision on the considered data and preference parameters. In this paper, we propose to combine the Choquet integral preference model with the SMAA methodology in order to get robust recommendations taking into account all parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the Decision Maker (DM). In case the criteria are on a common scale, one has to elicit only a set of non-additive weights, technically a capacity, compatible with the DM’s preference information. Instead, if the criteria are on different scales, besides the capacity, one has to elicit also a common scale compatible with the preferences given by the DM. Our approach permits to explore the whole space of capacities and common scales compatible with the DM’s preference information.

@highlight We apply SMAA to the Choquet integral preference model.
@highlight We take into account precise and imprecise evaluations of alternatives on criteria.
@highlight A common scale is built if the evaluations of alternatives are on different scales.
