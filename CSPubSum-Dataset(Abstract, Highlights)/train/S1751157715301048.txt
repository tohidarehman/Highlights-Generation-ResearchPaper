 We discuss, at the macro-level of nations, the contribution of research funding and rate of international collaboration to research performance, with important implications for the “science of science policy”. In particular, we cross-correlate suitable measures of these quantities with a scientometric-based assessment of scientific success, studying both the average performance of nations and their temporal dynamics in the space defined by these variables during the last decade. We find significant differences among nations in terms of efficiency in turning (financial) input into bibliometrically measurable output, and we confirm that growth of international collaboration positively correlate with scientific success—with significant benefits brought by EU integration policies. Various geo-cultural clusters of nations naturally emerge from our analysis. We critically discuss the factors that potentially determine the observed patterns.

@highlight We use funding, internationalization and impact to describe national research systems.
@highlight Internationalization and impact grow together, mostly for EU 15: integration policies.
@highlight USA evolve similarly to EU in internationalization but with a negative offset.
@highlight Eastern Europe is slowly detaching from the Russian attractor.
@highlight Asian nations remain isolated, and their impact is not increasing significantly.
