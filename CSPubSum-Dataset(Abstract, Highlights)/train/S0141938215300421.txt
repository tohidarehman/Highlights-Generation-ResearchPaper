 Electronic visual displays have shown a rapid technological evolution in the last two decades. With reference to the ergonomic requirements for video display terminal (VDT) workstations , at an international level, attention is focused on the human–system interaction. With reference to visual ergonomics, the aim of this study is to assess luminance conditions through in-field measurements in order to evaluate: luminance and contrast ratios, luminance and contrast non-uniformities. The assessment was applied to widespread flat screen displays and repeated for fourteen combinations of Contrast–Brightness. The analysis carried out by the Authors shows the importance of realizing a simple and quick procedure to determine the performance levels of displays used in VDT workstations. The proposed assessment could be used as a practical tool for staff assigned to assess the risks arising from VDT use in the workplace within the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Procedure.

@highlight We have analyzed the International Standards on ergonomics of human–system interaction.
@highlight We have assessed luminance conditions of displays through in-field measurements.
@highlight Displays were rated on 14 different Contrast–Brightness combinations.
@highlight Displays have met the requirements only for some Contrast–Brightness combinations.
@highlight Analysis has shown the importance of a rapid assessment of display performance.
