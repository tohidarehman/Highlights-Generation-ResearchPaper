 Recently, it has been pointed out that transport models should reflect all significant traveler choice behavior. In particular, trip generation, trip distribution, modal split as well as route choice should be modeled in a consistent process based on the equilibrium between transport supply and travel demand. In this paper a general fixed-point approach that allows dealing with multi-user stochastic equilibrium assignment with variable demand is presented. The main focus was on investigating the effectiveness of internal and external approaches and of different algorithmic specifications based on the method of successive averages within the internal approach. The vector demand function was assumed non-separable, non-symmetric cost functions were adopted and implementation issues, such updating step and convergence criterion, were investigated. In particular the aim was threefold: (i) compare the internal and the external approaches; (ii) investigate the effectiveness of different algorithmic specifications to solve the variable demand equilibrium assignment problem through the internal approach; (iii) investigate the incidence of the number of the links with non-separable and/or asymmetrical cost functions. The proposed analyses were carried out with respect to two real-scale urban networks regarding medium-size urban contexts in Italy.
