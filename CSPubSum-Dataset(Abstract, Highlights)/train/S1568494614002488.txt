 An approach to generating qualitative descriptions of multivariate time series using the ‘Temporal Fuzzy Model’ as an intermediate representation is presented. This model, based on fuzzy logic, allows of representing in a linguistic way, the information contained in multivariate time series. The extraction of qualitative descriptions can then be carried out directly. We present a formal description of the temporal fuzzy models, the induction and inference algorithms associated with them, and a process that acquires text from them. Finally, we present a set of experiments in order to establish a measure of how valid a representation is the model of the multivariate system, and also a second set of experiments that validate the qualitative description process.
