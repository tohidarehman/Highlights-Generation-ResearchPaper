 New bounds on the magnitudes of the first- and second-order partial derivatives of rational triangular BÃ©zier surfaces are presented. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed bounds are tighter than the existing ones. The superiority of the proposed new bounds is also illustrated by numerical tests.

@highlight We present new bounds on the magnitudes of the lower derivatives of rational triangular Bezier surfaces.
@highlight We theoretically prove that the proposed bounds are tighter than the existing ones.
@highlight The superiority of the proposed new bounds is also illustrated by two types of numerical tests.
