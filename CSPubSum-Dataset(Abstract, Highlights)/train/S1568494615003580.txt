 The recent developments in the image quality, storage and data transmission capabilities increase the importance of texture analysis, which plays an important role in computer vision and image processing. Local binary pattern (LBP) is an effective statistical texture descriptor, which has successful applications in texture classification. In this paper, two novel descriptors were proposed to search different patterns in images built on LBP. One of them is based on the relations between the sequential neighbors with a specified distance and the other one is based on determining the neighbors in the same orientation through central pixel parameter. These descriptors are tested with the Brodatz-1, Brodatz-2, Butterfly and Kylberg datasets to show the applicability of the proposed nLBP and dLBP descriptors. The proposed methods are also compared with classical LBP. The average accuracies obtained by ANN with 10 fold cross validation, which are 99.26% (LBP u2 and nLBP ), 94.44% (dLBPÎ±), 95.71% ( ) and %99.64 (nLBP ), for Brodatz-1, Brodatz-2, Butterfly and Kylberg datasets, respectively, show that the proposed methods outperform significant accuracies.

@highlight In this study, two novel local binary patterns were proposed.
@highlight First one is based on spatial relations between neighbors with a distance parameter.
@highlight The second is based on relations between a reference pixel and its neighbor on the same orientation.
@highlight Two approaches are improved to detect special patterns in images.
@highlight The results show that the proposed approaches can be used in image processing areas.
