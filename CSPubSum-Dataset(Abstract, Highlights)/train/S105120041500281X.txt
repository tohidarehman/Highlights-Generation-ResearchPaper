 The anisotropic diffusion is an efficient smoothing process. It is widely used in noise removing and edges preserving via different schemes. In this paper based on a mathematical background and the existing efficient anisotropic function in the literature we developed a new mathematical anisotropic diffusion function which is able to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional process such as the details loss and the image blur. The simulations results and the comparative study with other recent techniques are conducted and showed that the proposed schema generates a wide improvement in the quality of the restored images. This improvement has been shown subjectively in terms of visual quality, and objectively with reference to the computation of some criteria. The simulated images are well de-noised but the most important is that details and structural information are kept intact. In addition to that, the proposed new function was found very interesting and presents numerous advantages like its similarity to the conventional model and the importance of the speed hence it converges faster which allows an opportunity to be well implemented in our de-noising process.
