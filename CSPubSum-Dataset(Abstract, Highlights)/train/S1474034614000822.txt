 Most of the assessment of creativity in product design is based on the outcome, not the design process from which the creative ideas are derived. In this paper, we revealed the correlation coefficient of 20 factors critical in the product design process and the quality of design creativity via investigation of the design processes and outcomes of 30 senior student designers. Six closely related factors were identified as variables to calculate the design creativity. An assessment formula was proposed: the corresponding correlation coefficient is the weight factor of each variable, and the sum represents the design creativity degree. Our quantitative approach can improve the validity and reliability of assessment of creativity in product design.

@highlight Empirically examined the correlation coefficient between the product design process and the creativity of design outcome.
@highlight Developed a rigorous and quantitative method to measure creativity in product design.
@highlight Established a standard assessment of creativity in product design for both industry and academia.
