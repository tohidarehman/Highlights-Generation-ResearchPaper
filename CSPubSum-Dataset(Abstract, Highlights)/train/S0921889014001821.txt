 We introduce a novel, fabric-based, flexible, and stretchable tactile sensor, which is capable of seamlessly covering natural shapes. As humans and robots have curved body parts that move with respect to each other, the practical usage of traditional rigid tactile sensor arrays is limited. Rather, a flexible tactile skin is required. Our design allows for several tactile cells to be embedded in a single sensor patch. It can have an arbitrary perimeter and can cover free-form surfaces. In this article we discuss the construction of the sensor and evaluate its performance. Our flexible tactile sensor remains operational on top of soft padding such as a gel cushion, enabling the construction of a human-like soft tactile skin. The sensor allows pressure measurements to be read from a subtle less than 1 kPa up to high pressures of more than 500 kPa, which easily covers the common range for everyday human manual interactions. Due to a layered construction, the sensor is very robust and can withstand normal forces multiple magnitudes higher than what could be achieved by a human without sustaining damage. As an exciting application for the sensor, we describe the construction of a wearable tactile dataglove with 54 tactile cells and embedded data acquisition electronics. We also discuss the necessary implementation details to maintain long term sensor performance in the presence of moisture.
