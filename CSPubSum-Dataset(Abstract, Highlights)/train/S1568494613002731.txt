 In this work we present the parallel implementation of a hybrid global optimization algorithm assembled specifically to tackle a class of time consuming interatomic potential fitting problems. The resulting objective function is characterized by large and varying execution times, discontinuity and lack of derivative information. The presented global optimization algorithm corresponds to an irregular, two-level execution task graph where tasks are spawned dynamically. We use the OpenMP tasking model to express the inherent parallelism of the algorithm on shared-memory systems and a runtime library which implements the execution environment for adaptive task-based parallelism on multicore clusters. We describe in detail the hybrid global optimization algorithm and various parallel implementation issues. The proposed methodology is then applied to a specific instance of the interatomic potential fitting problem for the metal titanium. Extensive numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves the best parallel performance. In addition, its serial implementation performs well and therefore can also be used as a general purpose optimization algorithm.
