 The paper focuses on the adaptive relational association rule mining problem. Relational association rules represent a particular type of association rules which describe frequent relations that occur between the features characterizing the instances within a data set. We aim at re-mining an object set, previously mined, when the feature set characterizing the objects increases. An adaptive relational association rule method, based on the discovery of interesting relational association rules, is proposed. This method, called ARARM (Adaptive Relational Association Rule Mining) adapts the set of rules that was established by mining the data before the feature set changed, preserving the completeness. We aim to reach the result more efficiently than running the mining algorithm again from scratch on the feature-extended object set. Experiments testing the method's performance on several case studies are also reported. The obtained results highlight the efficiency of the ARARM method and confirm the potential of our proposal.

@highlight We propose a novel approach to adaptive relational association rule mining.
@highlight ARARM algorithm is capable of adaptively mining relational association rules.
@highlight It is applied when the feature set characterizing the objects to be mined increases over time.
@highlight Experiments show a significant reduction in running time compared to the non-adaptive method.
@highlight ARARM is faster with 53% (in average) than the non-adaptive method.
