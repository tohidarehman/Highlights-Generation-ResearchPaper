 Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) has developed into a powerful tool for deep tissue imaging with a better spatial resolution. But the data acquisition time in PAM is so long that it is a great challenge for real time imaging. In this paper, a new PAM data acquisition and image recovery method, called Compressive Sampling PAM System based on Low Rank Matrix Completion (CSLRM-PAM) is proposed to obtain a high-resolution PAM image with relatively low sampling rates. In order to successfully set up a CSLRM-PAM system, the two key problems which we need to keep focus on are design of the compressive sampling scheme and the corresponding image recovery algorithm. In this paper, two compressive sampling schemes based on expander graphs are proposed to replace the conventional point-by-point scanning scheme to implement fast data acquisition. Then, the low rank matrix completion is utilized to obtain high-resolution PAM image directly from the compressive sampling data. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated using both numerical analysis and PAM experiments. In contrast with the conventional system, the proposed CSLRM-PAM system is able to dramatically decrease the total sampling points for a relatively high-resolution PAM image and to implement accelerated data acquisition.

@highlight A Compressive Sampling PAM System based on Low Rank Matrix Completion (CSLRM-PAM) system has been set up to achieve fast data acquisition.
@highlight Two compressive sampling schemes based on edge expander graphs, including uniform random sampling and non-uniform sampling, have been proposed and compared for PAM image.
@highlight Compared to the uniform sampling scheme, the non-uniform one is more appropriate for PAM images.
@highlight The final PAM image is recovered directly from the compressive data by low rank matrix completion without dramatic loss of image resolution.
