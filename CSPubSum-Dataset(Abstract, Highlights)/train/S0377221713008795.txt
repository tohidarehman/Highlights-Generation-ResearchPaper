 Congestion is a major cause of inefficiency in air transportation. A question is whether delays during the arrival phase of a flight can be absorbed more fuel-efficiently in the future. In this context, we analyze Japanâ€™s flow strategy empirically and use queueing techniques in order to gain insight into the generation of the observed delays. Based on this, we derive a rule to balance congestion delays more efficiently between ground and en-route. Whether fuel efficiency can be further improved or not will depend on the willingness to review the concept of runway pressure.

@highlight Pre-scheduled traffic flows exhibit a serial correlation structure.
@highlight We solved a special case and analyzed the transient properties of the corresponding queueing system.
@highlight Based on this we derived a strategic rule for delay management.
