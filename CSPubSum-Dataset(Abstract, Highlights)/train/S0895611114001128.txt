 Aim To assess the quality of three-dimensional volume rendered computer tomography (3D-CTVR), multi-planar reformation (MPR) and CT section plane in the fine diagnosis of ossicular chain in middle ear cholesteatoma. Methods Sixty patients with middle ear cholesteatoma were selected in this retrospective study. All cases underwent pre-operative CT scan. The respective radiologic reports of the ossicles status via three protocols were then compared to surgical findings. Results Quality assessment of these three protocols in the fine diagnosis of fine ossicles buried inside the soft tissue showed that both CTVR and MPR are more superior to conventional section plane, especially CTVR. Conclusion The uses of CTVR and MPR, in conjunction with conventional section plane, are better able to show where the true and fine ossicular chain in the cholesteatoma mass is. In the final analysis, we believe that the use of CTVR and MPR techniques can have profound contributive value in future clinical work.
