 In this study, the effects of ambient illuminance and light source on participants’ reading performance and visual fatigue during a long reading task were investigated using three electronic paper displays. Reading on electronic paper displays was also compared with reading on paper. In Experiment 1, 100 participants performed a reading task where the display area for the text was equated for the displays. The results indicated that participants’ visual performance and visual fatigue did not differ significantly among different electronic paper displays, ambient illuminance conditions, or light sources. In Experiment 2, another 60 participants performed the same reading task where the full screen of each electronic paper display was used to present the text. The results showed that reading speed differed significantly across different electronic paper displays and ambient illuminance levels. The reading speed was slower for displays with smaller screens and increased as the ambient illuminance increased. Changes in the critical flicker fusion frequency significantly differed across ambient illuminance levels. Implications of the results for the use of electronic paper displays are discussed.

@highlight Electronic paper displays with large screen have faster reading speed.
@highlight Both sun light and fluorescent light are proper for reading on E-paper display.
@highlight Ambient illuminances 1000lx and 1500lx have better visual performance.
@highlight Ambient illuminances 200lx have more visual fatigue.
