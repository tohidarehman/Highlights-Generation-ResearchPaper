 Gender theories developed from traditional fixed and negotiated price shopping have largely been untested in the context of online auctions. The present study intends to fill this gap. Specifically, this study compares male and female online bidders based on their motivations, psychographics, and purchasing behavior. Our results show that females are more likely than males to be enjoyment seekers, information seekers, bargain hunters, variety seekers, and impulsive buyers. Female online bidders also have a higher level of risk aversion and need for uniqueness, but exhibit a lower level of social interaction than males. This study also finds that males are more likely to purchase electronics and computers, whereas females are more likely to purchase books, clothing, jewelry, and toys through online auctions. Based on these results, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.
