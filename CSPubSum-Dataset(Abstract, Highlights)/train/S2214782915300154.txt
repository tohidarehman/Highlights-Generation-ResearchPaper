 Objectives Audiologists provide professional contact and support between appointments to clients with hearing impairment using telephone and e-mail, but more advanced and flexible technological platforms are also possible. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical application of an Internet-based support system for audiologists and their first-time hearing aid clients. Design An Internet-based support system developed by MÃ¥nsson et al.  for psychologists and their clients was adapted for audiologic purposes. Three audiologic clinics in Sweden tested the support system with their clients. Study sample Twenty-three clients managed by four audiologists used and evaluated the support system. In addition, five of the clients and all four audiologists were interviewed and their responses were analyzed using content analysis. Results The clients and the audiologists reported positive experiences and overall satisfaction but audiologists reported that the support system did not address the needs of all clients. More positive experiences and greater satisfaction with the support system were associated with reductions on self-reported consequences of hearing loss and positive hearing aids outcomes. Conclusions An Internet-based support system can be used in audiologic rehabilitation. Both audiologists and clients recognized the system's potential value to offer an online support to the provision of audiologic services.
