 This paper introduces a novel approach for identity authentication system based on metacarpophalangeal joint patterns (MJPs). A discriminative common vector (DCV) based method is utilized for feature selection. In the literature, there is no study using whole MJP for identity authentication, exceptionally a work  using the hand knuckle pattern which is some part of the MJP draws the attention as a similar study. The originality of this approach is that: whole MJP is firstly used as a biometric identifier and DCV method is firstly applied for extracting the feature set of MJP. The developed system performs some basic tasks like image acquisition, image pre-processing, feature extraction, matching, and performance evaluation. The feasibility and effectiveness of this approach is rigorously evaluated using the k-fold cross validation technique on two different databases: a publicly available database and a specially established database. The experimental results indicate that the MJPs are very distinctive biometric identifiers and can be securely used in biometric identification and verification systems, DCV method is successfully employed for obtaining the feature set of MJPs and proposed MJP based authentication approach is very successful according to state of the art techniques with a recognition rate of between 95.33% and 100.00%.

@highlight A new biometric identifier: whole MJP pattern is introduced.
