 A new pathological tremor signal prediction algorithm for tremor suppression, the adaptive multiple oscillators linear combiner (AMOLC) based on Hopf oscillator, is proposed in this paper. This method can be used to predict pathological tremor signal with high accuracy and well robustness. An experimental platform is built to simulate the tremor motion to obtain the optimum parameters of AMOLC algorithm. Furthermore, AMOLC algorithm is applied to tremor prediction for actual pathological tremor patients. Results verify that chosen model parameters indeed improve the prediction performance which meets the demand of tremor suppression with high accuracy and well robustness. A comparison of computational complexity is conducted between some existing prediction methods and AMOLC.
