 In this paper, an overview is presented of the existing metaheuristic solution procedures to solve the multi-mode resource-constrained-project scheduling problem, in which multiple execution modes are available for each of the activities of the project. A fair comparison is made between the different metaheuristic algorithms on the existing benchmark datasets and on a newly generated dataset. Computational results are provided and recommendations for future research are formulated.

@highlight This paper evaluates meta-heuristic procedures for the multi-mode RCPSP.
@highlight New benchmark instances for the multi-mode RCPSP have been proposed.
@highlight A fair comparison between the procedures has been described.
