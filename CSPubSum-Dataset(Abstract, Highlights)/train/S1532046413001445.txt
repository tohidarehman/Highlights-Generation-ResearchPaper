 Discovery of clinical pathway (CP) patterns has experienced increased attention over the years due to its importance for revealing the structure, semantics and dynamics of CPs, and to its usefulness for providing clinicians with explicit knowledge which can be directly used to guide treatment activities of individual patients. Generally, discovery of CP patterns is a challenging task as treatment behaviors in CPs often have a large variability depending on factors such as time, location and patient individual. Based on the assumption that CP patterns can be derived from clinical event logs which usually record various treatment activities in CP executions, this study proposes a novel approach to CP pattern discovery by modeling CPs using mixtures of an extension to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation family that jointly models various treatment activities and their occurring time stamps in CPs. Clinical case studies are performed to evaluate the proposed approach via real-world data sets recording typical treatment behaviors in patient careflow. The obtained results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach for CP pattern discovery, and indicate the promise in research efforts related to CP analysis and optimization.

@highlight We propose a probabilistic model to discover underlying patterns in clinical pathways.
@highlight Our approach models treatment activities and that of occurrences in clinical pathways.
@highlight Evaluation is done using a real clinical dataset from a Chinese hospital.
@highlight Discovered patterns surmise the essential features of clinical pathways.
@highlight Discovered patterns can profitably be exploited as a basis for further analytical objectives.
