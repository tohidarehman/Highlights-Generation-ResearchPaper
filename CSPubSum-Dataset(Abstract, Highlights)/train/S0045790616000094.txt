 Due to intra-flow and inter-flow interference problems, the throughput performance decreases dramatically in a multi-hop wireless network. These two kinds of bandwidth unfair sharing problems could cause serious collisions and congestion, hence affecting the performance of multi-hop wireless networks. That is to say, data packets that need to traverse more hops to arrive at the destination will get lower throughput and result in the inter-flow fairness problem. Furthermore, the quality of video transmission is especially poor in traditional multi-hop wireless network environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a virtual queue management scheme that does not require the modification of any communication protocol. According to the number of flows, it adjusts the queue management scheme to achieve each flow's fair sharing of channel resource. It also improves the quality of video transmission. Through NS2 simulations, the results show that our proposed scheme can mitigate the inter-flow fairness problem and effectively improves the quality of video transmission.
