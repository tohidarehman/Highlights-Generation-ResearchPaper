 Context When dealing with improvements, organizations seek to find a break-even point as early as possible in order to maximize ROI. In some cases such a strategy can lead to long-term failures by not realizing full benefits, when focusing only on the short-term. LEGO (Living Engineering Process) allows building customized process meta-models based on multiple inputs, making an organization more efficient and effective by optimizing resources, time and costs. This paper introduces elements for designing a strategy for more efficient deployments of process improvement initiatives, optimizing the choice of models and elements to be considered as input to the LEGO approach.

@highlight Discuss the benefits from a well established long-term strategy (not only tactic).
@highlight Propose the LEGO approach for making organizations more effective and efficient, optimizing resources.
@highlight Show the needed elements for designing a strategy for a better deployment of a process improvement initiative.
