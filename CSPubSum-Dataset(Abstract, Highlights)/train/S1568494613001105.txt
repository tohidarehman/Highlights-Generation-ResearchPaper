 Support vector regression (SVR) has become very promising and popular in the field of machine learning due to its attractive features and profound empirical performance for small sample, nonlinearity and high dimensional data application. However, most existing support vector regression learning algorithms are limited to the parameters selection and slow learning for large sample. This paper considers an adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm for the parameters selection of support vector regression model. In order to accelerate its training process while keeping high accurate forecasting in each parameters selection step of APSO iteration, an optimal training subset (OTS) method is carried out to choose the representation data points of the full training data set. Furthermore, the optimal parameters setting of SVR and the optimal size of OTS are studied preliminary. Experimental results of an UCI data set and electric load forecasting in New South Wales show that the proposed model is effective and produces better generalization performance.
