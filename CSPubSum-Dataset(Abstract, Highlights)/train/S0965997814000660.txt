 An open source program to generate zero-thickness cohesive interface elements in existing finite element discretizations is presented. This contribution fills the gap in the literature that, to the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge, there is no such program exists. The program is useful in numerical modeling of material/structure failure using cohesive interface elements. The program is able to generate one/two dimensional, linear/quadratic cohesive elements (i) at all inter-element boundaries, (ii) at material interfaces and (iii) at grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials. Algorithms and utilization of the program is discussed. Several two dimensional and three dimensional fracture mechanics problems are given including debonding process of material interfaces, multiple delamination of composite structures, crack propagation in polycrystalline structures.

@highlight We present an open source program to insert cohesive interface elements to be in fintie element meshes.
@highlight The algorithms are discussed in details and installation and usage are presented.
@highlight The code generates one/two dimensional cohesive interface elements, both linear and quadratic.
@highlight High order Bezier elements are also supported.
@highlight It fills the gap in the literature that there does not exist any such open source program.
