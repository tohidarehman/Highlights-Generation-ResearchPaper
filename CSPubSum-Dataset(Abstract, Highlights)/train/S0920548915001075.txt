 The emergence of cloud environments makes users convenient to synchronize files across platform and devices. However, the data security and privacy are still critical issues in public cloud environments. In this paper, a private cloud storage service with the potential for security and performance concerns is proposed. A data deduplication scheme is designed in the proposed private cloud storage system to reduce cost and increase the storage efficiency. Moreover, the Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI) standard is implemented in the proposed system to increase the interoperability. The proposed service provides an easy way to for user to establish the system and access data across devices conveniently. The experiment results also show the superiority of the proposed interoperable private cloud storage service in terms of data transmission and storage efficiency. By comparing with the existing system Gluster Swift, the proposed system is demonstrated much suitable for the service environment where most of the transmitted data are small files.
