 Nowadays a large number of opinion reviews are posted on the Web. Such reviews are a very important source of information for customers and companies. The former rely more than ever on online reviews to make their purchase decisions, and the latter to respond promptly to their clients’ expectations. Unfortunately, due to the business that is behind, there is an increasing number of deceptive opinions, that is, fictitious opinions that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, in order to deceive the consumers promoting a low quality product (positive deceptive opinions) or criticizing a potentially good quality one (negative deceptive opinions). In this paper we focus on the detection of both types of deceptive opinions, positive and negative. Due to the scarcity of examples of deceptive opinions, we propose to approach the problem of the detection of deceptive opinions employing PU-learning. PU-learning is a semi-supervised technique for building a binary classifier on the basis of positive (i.e., deceptive opinions) and unlabeled examples only. Concretely, we propose a novel method that with respect to its original version is much more conservative at the moment of selecting the negative examples (i.e., not deceptive opinions) from the unlabeled ones. The obtained results show that the proposed PU-learning method consistently outperformed the original PU-learning approach. In particular, results show an average improvement of 8.2% and 1.6% over the original approach in the detection of positive and negative deceptive opinions respectively.
