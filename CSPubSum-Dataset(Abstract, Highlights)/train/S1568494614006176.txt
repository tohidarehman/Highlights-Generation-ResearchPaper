 Active power filter (APF) performance is entirely dependent on capacitor voltage. DC voltage optimization is one of the key aspects in harmonics compensation. This paper presents an experimental comparative study of new adaptive fuzzy controller (AFC) and proportional integral (PI) regulator, applied to regulate the DC bus voltage of three phase shunt APF. The proposed AFC for APF, consist to adapt the output gain of this controller at every situation of the system as a function of the voltage error and its variation. The algorithm used to identify the reference currents is based on the Self Tuning Filter (STF). The firing pulses of the insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) inverter are generated using a hysteresis current controller; which is implemented on an analog card. Finally, the above study, under steady state and transient conditions, is illustrated with signal-flow graphs and corresponding analysis. This study was verified by experimental tests on hardware prototype based on dSPACE-1104.

@highlight The output gain of the adaptive fuzzy controller (AFC), it is considerate as a fuzzy variable.
@highlight This gain is adapted as a function of the voltage error and its variation.
@highlight The comparative at PI controller study, shows that the adaptive fuzzy controller can be enhance the performances the DC voltage control at various operating.
@highlight Experimental results validate the design methodology.
