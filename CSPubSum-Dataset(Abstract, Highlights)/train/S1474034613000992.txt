 The engineering of laminated composite structures is a complex task for design engineers and manufacturers, requiring significant management of manufacturing process and materials information. Ontologies are becoming increasingly commonplace for semantically representing knowledge in a formal manner that facilitates sharing of rich information between people and applications. Moreover, ontologies can support first-order logic and reasoning by rule engines that enhance automation. To support the engineering of laminated composite structures, this work developed a novel Semantic LAminated Composites Knowledge management System (SLACKS) that is based on a suite of ontologies for laminated composites materials and design for manufacturing (DFM) and their integration into a previously developed engineering design framework. By leveraging information from CAD/FEA tools and materials data from online public databases, SLACKS uniquely enables software tools and people to interoperate, to improve communication and automate reasoning during the design process. With SLACKS, this paper shows the power of integrating relevant domains of the product life cycle, such as design, analysis, manufacturing and materials selection through the engineering case study of a wind turbine blade. The integration reveals a usable product-life-cycle knowledge tool that can facilitate efficient knowledge creation, retrieval and reuse from design inception to manufacturing of the product.

@highlight Knowledge management issues in laminated composites engineering are identified. • A semantic framework for laminated composites design based on ontologies is built. • Integrated with public material databases and manufacturability and analysis tools. • Design of a wind turbine blade used as case study. • Powerful querying and inferencing abilities demonstrated.
