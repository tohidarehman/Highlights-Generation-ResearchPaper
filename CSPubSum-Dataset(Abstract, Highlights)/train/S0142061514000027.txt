 During the last years wind power has emerged as one of the most important sources in the power generation share. Due to stringent Grid Code requirements, wind power plants (WPPs) should provide ancillary services such as fault ride-through and damping of power system oscillations to resemble conventional generation. Through an adequate selection of input–output signal pairs, WPPs can be effectively used to provide electromechanical oscillations damping. In this paper, different analysis techniques considering both controllability and observability measures and input–output interactions are compared and critically examined. Recommendations are drawn to select the best signal pairs available from WPPs to contribute to power oscillations damping. Control system design approaches including single-input single-output and multivariable control are considered. The recommendation of analysis techniques is justified through the tools usage in a test system including a WPP.
