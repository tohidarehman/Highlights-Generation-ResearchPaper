 Credit scoring aims to assess the risk associated with lending to individual consumers. Recently, ensemble classification methodology has become popular in this field. However, most researches utilize random sampling to generate training subsets for constructing the base classifiers. Therefore, their diversity is not guaranteed, which may lead to a degradation of overall classification performance. In this paper, we propose an ensemble classification approach based on supervised clustering for credit scoring. In the proposed approach, supervised clustering is employed to partition the data samples of each class into a number of clusters. Clusters from different classes are then pairwise combined to form a number of training subsets. In each training subset, a specific base classifier is constructed. For a sample whose class label needs to be predicted, the outputs of these base classifiers are combined by weighted voting. The weight associated with a base classifier is determined by its classification performance in the neighborhood of the sample. In the experimental study, two benchmark credit data sets are adopted for performance evaluation, and an industrial case study is conducted. The results show that compared to other ensemble classification methods, the proposed approach is able to generate base classifiers with higher diversity and local accuracy, and improve the accuracy of credit scoring.
