 This article reports new findings on the incidence of risk and the associated experience of harm reported by children and adolescents aged 11â€“16, regarding receipt of sexual messages on the internet (known popularly as sexting). Findings showed that the main predictors of the risk of seeing or receiving sexual messages online are age (older), psychological difficulties (higher), sensation seeking (higher) and risky online and offline behavior (higher). By contrast, the main predictors of harm resulting from receiving such messages were age (younger), gender (girls), psychological difficulties (higher) and sensation seeking (lower), with no effect for risky online or offline behavior. The findings suggest that accounts of internet-related risks should distinguish between predictors of risk and harm. Since some exposure to risk is necessary to build resilience, rather than aiming to reduce risk through policy and practical interventions, the findings can be used to more precisely target those who experience harm in order to reduce harm overall from internet use.

@highlight We examine the risk, and resulting harm, of receiving sexual messages online among adolescents.
@highlight Increased psychological difficulties and sensation seeking increases the risk of receiving sexual messages.
@highlight Increased psychological difficulties but decreased sensation seeking increases reported harm.
@highlight Online and offline risk behaviors mediate the likelihood of risk but not harm.
@highlight Identifying these risk factors will aid policy makers to target help on those who are more vulnerable.
