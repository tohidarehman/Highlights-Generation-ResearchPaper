 This paper proposes a mobility management solution for IPv6-based vehicular networks. First, the architecture based on vehicle domains is proposed in order to reduce the mobility handover frequency and delay. Based on the architecture, a distributed address configuration algorithm is proposed. Based on the address configuration algorithm, a vehicle can establish a routing path reaching the nearest AP (Access point) and achieve the multi-hop communication with the Internet through the routing path. Finally, based on the routing algorithm, the mobility management solution is proposed. The data results show that the solution shortens the mobility handover delay and lowers the packet loss.
