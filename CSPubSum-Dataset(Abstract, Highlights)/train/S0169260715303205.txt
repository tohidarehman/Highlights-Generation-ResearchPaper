 Background Dynamic measurements of human muscle fascicle length from sequences of B-mode ultrasound images have become increasingly prevalent in biomedical research. Manual digitisation of these images is time consuming and algorithms for automating the process have been developed. Here we present a freely available software implementation of a previously validated algorithm for semi-automated tracking of muscle fascicle length in dynamic ultrasound image recordings, “UltraTrack”. Methods UltraTrack implements an affine extension to an optic flow algorithm to track movement of the muscle fascicle end-points throughout dynamically recorded sequences of images. The underlying algorithm has been previously described and its reliability tested, but here we present the software implementation with features for: tracking multiple fascicles in multiple muscles simultaneously; correcting temporal drift in measurements; manually adjusting tracking results; saving and re-loading of tracking results and loading a range of file formats. Results Two example runs of the software are presented detailing the tracking of fascicles from several lower limb muscles during a squatting and walking activity. Conclusion We have presented a software implementation of a validated fascicle-tracking algorithm and made the source code and standalone versions freely available for download.

@highlight We have developed a freely available software package for semi-automated tracking of muscle fascicles in B-mode ultrasound image sequences.
@highlight Includes features to track multiple fascicles in multiple regions of the image and to correct for measurement drift with time.
@highlight The software is available for Windows and MacOS as a standalone program or source code.
