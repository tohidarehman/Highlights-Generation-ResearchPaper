 Every year, natural and man-made disasters affect hundreds of thousands of people and cause extensive damage. OR has made substantial contributions to disaster response and these have been the subject of several recent literature reviews. However, these reviews have also identified research gaps for OR – two of which are  limited contribution from soft OR, and  a need to model communications during disasters where there are complex interactions between stakeholders. At the intersection of these gaps we apply the Viable System Model (VSM) to examine challenges of rapid communication viability during dynamic disasters. The data that informs this paper were collected in four case studies in Japan – three on its current capabilities (e.g. a local government disaster management office) and one on its response to a past disaster . This paper shows how applying VSM identified generic gaps and opportunities for communication systems and shows how these case studies signal the utility of VSM structures to arranging communications for fast-paced and changing environments. This paper also contributes to VSM theory through developing two new concepts  environmental support mechanisms for viability; and  rapid implementation unit emergence.

@highlight Recent reviews in EJOR (and JORS) have studied OR's contribution to disaster response.
@highlight Each review finds little contribution from soft OR or modelling disaster information.
@highlight Effective communication is vital to manage disaster response resources.
@highlight The Viable System Model (VSM) can examine rapid disaster communication viability.
@highlight Four disaster case studies use VSM to identify structural communication faults.
