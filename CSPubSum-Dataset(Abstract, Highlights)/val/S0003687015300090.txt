 The research aims to address the physically loading task and quality and productivity problems in the brazing of coils of air-handler units. Eight operators participated in two intervention studies conducted in a factory in Malaysia to compare the status quo brazing with  the use of a new twin-brazing torch that replaced the single-brazing gun and  brazing in a sitting position. The outcome measures are related to quality, productivity, monetary costs, body postures and symptoms. After baseline, Interventions I and II were applied for 3 months respectively. The results show a 58.9% quality improvement, 140% productivity increase and 113 times ROI. There was also a reduction in poor work postures e.g. in the raising of the arms and shoulders; bending, twisting and extending of the neck; and bending of left and right wrists, and the back. This research can be replicated in other factories that share similar processes.

@highlight We address physically loading, quality and productivity problems in coil brazing.
@highlight Intervention I uses twin brazing torch (TBT) to replace the single brazing gun.
@highlight Intervention II uses TBT in sitting position.
@highlight Results: 58.9% quality and 140% productivity improvements and 113 times ROI.
@highlight Include reductions in bending of left and right wrists, neck and back.
