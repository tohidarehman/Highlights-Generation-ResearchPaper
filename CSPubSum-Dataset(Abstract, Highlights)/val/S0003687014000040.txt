 A total of 58 healthy subjects participated to elucidate the influence of indoor and outdoor temperatures on blood flow. After walking outdoors for 20min, the blood flow rate of a subject was measured. The subject then entered a classroom and studied for 120min, and afterwards, the blood flow rate was measured again. The subjects were exposed to outdoor temperature ranging from −2.5 to 33.7°C. During the summer, the average blood flow rate after walking outdoors was 45.95±25.790TPU (tissue perfusion units); after the class, this decreased to 36.14±21.837TPU (p <0.05). During the autumn, the blood flow rate decreased from 27.69±12.334TPU to 12.47±12.255TPU (p <0.001). When the outside air temperature was below 3°C, the blood flow rate indoors increased significantly from 6.74±3.540TPU to 13.95±11.522TPU (p <0.05). In a comfortable and healthy environment, the blood flow rate was not constant but fluctuated between 15TPU and 40TPU.

@highlight A building's air conditioning system could mitigate extremely high blood flow rates.
@highlight In a comfortable environment, blood flow fluctuates between 15TPU and 40TPU.
@highlight When outdoor weather is below 3°C, warm indoor air can increase microcirculation.
@highlight Remaining calm for a long time indoors could reduce the level of angiogenesis.
