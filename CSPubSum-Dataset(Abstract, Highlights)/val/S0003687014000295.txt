 While much research exists on occupant packaging both proprietary and in the literature, more detailed research regarding user preferences for subjective ratings of steering wheel designs is sparse in published literature. This study aimed to explore the driver interactions with production steering wheels in four vehicles by using anthropometric data, driver hand placement, and driver grip design preferences for Generation-Y and Baby Boomers. In this study, participants selected their preferred grip diameter, responded to a series of questions about the steering wheel grip as they sat in four vehicles, and rank ordered their preferred grip design. Thirty-two male participants (16 Baby Boomers between ages 47 and 65 and 16 Generation-Y between ages 18 and 29) participated in the study. Drivers demonstrated different gripping behavior between vehicles and between groups. Recommendations for future work in steering wheel grip design and naturalistic driver hand positioning are discussed.

@highlight Baby Boomer and Generation-Y adults sat in four vehicles and chose their preferred hand placement.
@highlight Height was significantly correlated with grip diameter preference and 3.2Â cm was the most popular.
@highlight Hand placement was correlated with height, with shorter adults using an asymmetrical grip.
@highlight Hand placement location varies by vehicle and age group.
@highlight Future research should consider more controlled conditions and simulator or on road studies.
