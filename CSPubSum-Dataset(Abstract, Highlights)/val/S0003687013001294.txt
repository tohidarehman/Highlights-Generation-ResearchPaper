 Firefighters perform many tasks which require a high level of fitness and their personal safety may be compromised by the physiological aging process. The aim of the study was to evaluate strength (bench-press), power (countermovement jump), sprint (20 m) and endurance (with and without Self Contained Breathing Apparatus – S.C.B.A.) of 161 Italian firefighters recruits in relation to age groups (<25 yr; 26–30 yr; 31–35 yr; 36–40 yr; 41–42 yr). Descriptive statistics and an ANOVA were calculated to provide the physical fitness profile for each parameter and to assess differences (p < 0.05) among age groups. Anthropometric values showed an age-effect for height and BMI, while performances values showed statistical differences for strength, power, sprint tests and endurance test with S.C.B.A. Wearing the S.C.B.A., 14% of all recruits failed to complete the endurance test. We propose that the firefighters should participate in an assessment of work capacity and specific fitness programs aimed to maintain an optimal fitness level for all ages.

@highlight The percentage of overweight and obesity among Italian firefighters is lower than that was documented for the US firefighters.
@highlight Physical fitness tests results were systematically better for the younger categories than the older age group.
@highlight Performances values showed statistical differences for 1RM bench-press, CMJ, 20 m and endurance test with S.C.B.A.
@highlight Wearing the protective clothing and S.C.B.A., 14% of all firefighters recruits failed to complete the endurance test.
