 This paper describes an experiment that was undertaken to compare three levels of automation in rail signalling; a high level in which an automated agent set routes for trains using timetable information, a medium level in which trains were routed along pre-defined paths, and a low level where the operator (signaller) was responsible for the movement of all trains. These levels are described in terms of a Rail Automation Model based on previous automation theory . Performance, subjective workload, and signaller activity were measured for each level of automation running under both normal operating conditions and abnormal, or disrupted, conditions. The results indicate that perceived workload, during both normal and disrupted phases of the experiment, decreased as the level of automation increased and performance was most consistent (i.e. showed the least variation between participants) with the highest level of automation. The results give a strong case in favour of automation, particularly in terms of demonstrating the potential for automation to reduce workload, but also suggest much benefit can achieved from a mid-level of automation potentially at a lower cost and complexity. Research in the area of automation, and in particular in the examination of human interaction with different levels of automation, has normally been undertaken in laboratory settings using simple tasks and na√Øve participants where the level of automation can be easily manipulated. This research was undertaken with expert participants using complex simulation of three ecologically valid levels of automation and provides empirical field validation of some of the results found in laboratory studies.

@highlight We compared three levels of automation in an ecologically valid rail signalling environment.
@highlight We measured performance, subjective workload and operator activity for each level.
@highlight Workload decreased as automation increased for both normal and disrupted conditions.
@highlight Performance became more consistent across participants as automation increased.
@highlight Individual operators engage in different strategies when working with automation.
