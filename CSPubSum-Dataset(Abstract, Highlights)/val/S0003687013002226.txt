 A simple obstacle detection device, based upon an automobile parking sensor, was assessed as a mobility aid for the visually impaired. A questionnaire survey for mobility needs was performed at the start of this study. After the detector was developed, five blindfolded sighted and 15 visually impaired participants were invited to conduct travel experiments under three test conditions:  using a white cane only,  using the obstacle detector only and  using both devices. A post-experiment interview regarding the usefulness of the obstacle detector for the visually impaired participants was performed. The results showed that the obstacle detector could augment mobility performance with the white cane. The obstacle detection device should be used in conjunction with the white cane to achieve the best mobility speed and body protection.

@highlight Obstacle detection is a major problem to be solved to ensure safe navigation for the visually impaired.
@highlight Static obstacles that are not located on the ground are hardly detected by white cane.
@highlight The obstacle detector developed might increase mobility performance and was well accepted by visually impaired participants.
