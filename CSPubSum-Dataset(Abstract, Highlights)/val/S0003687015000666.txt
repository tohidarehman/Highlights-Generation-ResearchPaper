 This study utilized the “story grammar” approach  to analyze the within-corpus differences in recounting of sixty 6- and 7-year-old children, specifically whether illustrations (5-factor accident sequence) were or were not resorted to as a means to assist their narration of a home accident in which a child received a burn injury from hot soup. Our investigation revealed that the message presentation strategy “combining oral and pictures” better helped young children to memorize the story content (sequence of events leading to the burn injury) than “oral only.” Specifically, the content of “the dangerous objects that caused the injury”, “the unsafe actions that people involved took”, and “how the people involved felt about the severity of the accident” differed significantly between the two groups.
