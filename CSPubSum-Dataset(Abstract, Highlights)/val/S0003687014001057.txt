 This study assessed the combined effect of physical and psychosocial/organisational and/or environmental factors on the presence of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) and its consequences (reduced activities and absenteeism due to MSS) in a random sample of 3003 workers in New Zealand. By telephone interview, participants reported their current workplace exposures and MSS (neck/shoulder, arm/elbow, wrist and low back) and its consequences. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Combined exposure to physical and psychosocial/organisational and/or environmental factors increased the odds of MSS in the neck/shoulder (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.79–5.52), arms/elbow regions (OR 4.14, 95% CI 2.21–7.76) and low back (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.28–2.37) and its consequences, i.e. reduced activities due to neck/shoulder symptoms (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.28–13.00), absenteeism due to neck/shoulder symptoms (OR 5.19, 95% CI 2.24–12.01) and absenteeism due to low back symptoms (OR 4.37, 95% CI 2.92–6.53). In contrast, favourable psychosocial/organisational work conditions reduced the odds of wrist symptoms due to poor physical work conditions (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.44–3.34). We conclude that to reduce MSS and its consequences, employers need to adopt a multifaceted approach: concentrate on improving physical conditions as well as the psychosocial/organisational and environmental aspects of the working environment.

@highlight Combined exposure to poor physical and poor psychosocial factors increased the odds of MSS.
@highlight This combination also increased the odds of reduced activities and absenteeism due to MSS.
@highlight Favourable psychosocial conditions reduced the odds of MSS due to poor physical conditions.
@highlight To reduce MSS and its consequences, employers need to adopt a multifaceted approach.
