 Objective To determine the effects of a moderate-intensity active workstation on time and error during simulated office work. Methods The aim of the study was to analyse simultaneous work and exercise for non-sedentary office workers. We monitored oxygen uptake, heart rate, sweating stains area, self-perceived effort, typing test time with typing error count and cognitive performance during 30 min of exercise with no cycling or cycling at 40 and 80 W. Results Compared baseline, we found increased physiological responses at 40 and 80 W, which corresponds to moderate physical activity (PA). Typing time significantly increased by 7.3% (p = 0.002) in C40W and also by 8.9% (p = 0.011) in C80W. Typing error count and cognitive performance were unchanged. Conclusions Although moderate intensity exercise performed on cycling workstation during simulated office tasks increases working task execution time with, it has moderate effect size; however, it does not increase the error rate. Participants confirmed that such a working design is suitable for achieving the minimum standards for daily PA during work hours.

@highlight Pedalling workstation enables moderate exercise without seriously affecting work.
@highlight Half an hour daily usage achieves minimum physical activity recommendations.
@highlight Most participants would rather use this workstation than exercise outside work.
@highlight Can also be used during free time (sport events, TV, Cinema, PC, commuting, etc.).
