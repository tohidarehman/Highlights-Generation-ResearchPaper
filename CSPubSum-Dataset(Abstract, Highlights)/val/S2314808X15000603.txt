 A series of azosalicylic acid analogs were newly synthesized by coupling various aryl and heteroarylamine functionalities with salicylic acid nucleus. All the synthesized compounds were structurally confirmed by various modern analytical methods. The said synthesized compounds were screened to investigate their antimicrobial, analgesic and antioxidant activities. The compounds 4e and 4h showed excellent significant antibacterial activity against most of the bacterial strains as no compounds showed significant antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans. The bromine substituted molecule 4e (4-bromo-3-methyl phenyl azosalicylic acid analog) showed the highest significant analgesic activity with 46.10% of inhibition. The results of in vitro antibacterial and analgesic activity were justified with the outcome of in-silico investigation. The results of biological activities were statistically interpreted. The compounds substituted with antipyrinylazo and 4-carboxy phenylazo moiety exhibited potential antioxidant activity.
