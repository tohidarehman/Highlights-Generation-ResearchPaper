 In thermal analysis of concrete with cooling pipes by conventional FEM (finite element method), extremely refined conforming meshes have to be generated around the pipe axis to obtain precise temperature field. It makes the meshing process demanding and cumbersome, especially in 3D cases. To avoid the difficulty of refining meshes in conventional FEM, an extended finite element method (XFEM) is proposed in this paper with which thermal analysis with pipes can be performed on coarse meshes instead of refined conforming meshes. The enrichment shape function is constructed in the proposed XFEM based on analytical solution and the Dirichlet boundary condition of the cooling pipe is numerically approximated by in-element Robin boundary condition. Thermal analysis of a concrete slab with a cooling pipe in the center is performed by XFEM with coarse meshes and by conventional FEM with refined conforming meshes respectively. The results demonstrate that the temperature field obtained by XFEM has a comparable accuracy level with the conventional FEM. The accuracy and reliability are further validated with three other numerical cases including the varying cooling boundary case, the internal heat source case and the multiple-pipe case. temperature (°C) density (kg/m3) boundary wall of cooling pipe water temperature (°C) approximation space maximum adiabatic temperature rise (°C) radial distance (m) pipe radius (m) outer radius of concrete cylinder (m) Bessel function of first kind time increment (day) stiffness matrix of heat transfer thermal load matrix Element specific heat capacity (kJ/kg°C) thermal conductivity (kJ/m°Cday) concrete domain equivalent boundary conventional Lagrangian shape function enriched shape function parameter representing the heat generation rate convective coefficient (kJ/m2 °Cday) excess temperature (°C) Bessel function of second kind characteristic time factor (day) initial temperature (°C) mass matrix of heat transfer time (d)
