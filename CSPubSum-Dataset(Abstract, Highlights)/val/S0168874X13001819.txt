 The cohesive zone model (CZM) approach has been shown to be an effective approach for simulating fracture events. However, CZM simulations of quasi-static events using an implicit solver usually encounter numerical difficulties due to the nonlinear and softening behavior of CZM. To overcome the numerical difficulties, an explicit solver, which is intended for fast transient problems, can be employed for quasi-static events, such as stable tearing crack growth. In the current study, a CZM based approach is applied to simulate Mode I stable tearing crack growth events in Arcan specimens made of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy, by using an explicit solver. The cohesive parameters obtained in a recent study  that lead to good predictions for both Mode I and mixed-mode I/II conditions are used in the current study. In order to shorten the solution time, two artificial acceleration techniques are employed:  acceleration by reducing the time period of the analysis and  acceleration by increasing the mass density of the model (mass scaling). A careful convergence study is carried out to gain an understanding of the choice of proper values for the parameters in the artificial acceleration techniques for efficient and accurate simulation predictions and to provide practical experience for CZM simulations in explicit analysis.
