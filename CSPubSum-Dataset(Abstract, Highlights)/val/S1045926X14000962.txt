 A number of accessible RDF stores are populating the linked open data world. The navigation on data reticular relationships is becoming every day more relevant. Several knowledge base present relevant links to common vocabularies while many others are going to be discovered increasing the reasoning capabilities of our knowledge base applications. In this paper, the Linked Open Graph, LOG, is presented. It is a web tool for collaborative browsing and navigation on multiple SPARQL entry points. The paper presented an overview of major problems to be addressed, a comparison with the state of the arts tools, and some details about the LOG graph computation to cope with high complexity of large Linked Open Dada graphs. The LOG.disit.org tool is also presented by means of a set of examples involving multiple RDF stores and putting in evidence the new provided features and advantages using dbPedia, Getty, Europeana, Geonames, etc. The LOG tool is free to be used, and it has been adopted, developed and/or improved in multiple projects: such as ECLAP for social media cultural heritage, Sii-Mobility for smart city, and ICARO for cloud ontology analysis, OSIM for competence/knowledge mining and analysis. Gruff presents literal attributes of URI as graph nodes, while LodLive uses a single aside panel, and LOG multiple frames, thus making simpler the comparison among nodes. In Gruff: single and multiple links can be off at the same time, limited capability in tuning on all links of the same kind in the graph. In LodLive, links can be singularly turned on/off. The complexity is not managed. In LOG, multiple links on/off of the same kind. LodLive and Gruff allow opening all or singularly, no middle way or precise control. LodLive presents a limited number of elements in some cases, and does not inform the user about the applied limitation. LodLive and Gruff adopt different colors for representing different type of entities, and not icons. In LOG.DISIT, the positioning of the entities and relationships is dynamically performed on the basis of a force model, in some case, this can be confusing. Gruff provide support to discover inbound/outbound links (as object/as subject) only taking into account the current RDF store. LOG and LodLive perform the query on a range of SPARQL entry points (at their disposal in some database), while others can be added. Gruff has a powerful zoom and large graph management; on the other hand, it is a standalone application in native code. LodLive provide direct support for placing on a Map the URI if they present GPS coordinates. Integration with Map can be performed for LOG since the LOG graphs can be opened and recalled by an REST call/URL. See for example, . LOG allow the loading of multiple SPARQL entry points and the web sharing of LOG graph, by sending emails with the links to reload and manipulate them.
