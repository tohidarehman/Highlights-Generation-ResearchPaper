 Previous studies defined passengers' comfort based on their concerns during the flight and a set of eight experiential factors such as ‘peace of mind’, ‘physical wellbeing’, ‘pleasure’, etc. One Objective of this paper was to determine whether the factors underlying the passengers' experience of comfort differ from those of discomfort. Another objective was to cross-validate those factors. In the first study, respondents provided written reports of flight comfort and discomfort experiences separately and gave ratings on the impact of the eight factors on each experience. Follow up interviews were also conducted. Significant difference was found between comfort and discomfort ratings for two factors of ‘pleasure’, denoted by one's concern for stimulation, ambience and exceeded expectations, and ‘physical wellbeing’ characterized in terms of bodily support and energy. However, there were no significant differences between the comfort and discomfort ratings on the other six factors. The evidence does not support the proposition that passenger comfort and discomfort are underline by different sets of factors. It is therefore suggested that the evaluation of overall passenger comfort experience, as a whole, employ one spectrum ranging from extreme comfort to discomfort. In study two, a pool of comfort descriptors was collected. Those that were less relevant to passenger comfort were eliminated in a number of steps. Factor analysis was used to classify the remaining descriptors, using respondents' ratings on their potential impact on passenger comfort. Seven factors corresponded to the pre-determined passenger comfort factors from previous research, validating those with an exception of ‘proxemics’ (concerning one's privacy and control over their situation) but it was argued that this is due to the nature of the factor itself, which is context dependent and generally perceived unconsciously.

@highlight The eight experiential aspects of passenger comfort are validated including ‘peace of mind’, ‘physical wellbeing’, ‘proxemics’, etc.
@highlight The factors impacting passenger comfort experience may be considered the same as those impacting discomfort.
@highlight Aircraft passengers may not experience privacy and control on a conscious level.
@highlight It is suggested to evaluate the overall comfort experience of passengers using one single rating scale ranging from extreme discomfort to extreme comfort.
