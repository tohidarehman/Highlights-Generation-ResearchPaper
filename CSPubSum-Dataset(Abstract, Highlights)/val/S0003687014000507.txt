 Firemen often suffer from heat strain. This study investigated two chest cooling systems for use under a firefighting suit. In nine male subjects, a vest with water soaked cooling pads and a vest with water perfused tubes were compared to a control condition. Subjects performed 30 min walking and 10 min recovery in hot conditions, while physiological and perceptual parameters were measured. No differences were observed in heart rate and rectal temperature, but scapular skin temperature and fluid loss were lower using the perfused vest. Thermal sensation was cooler for the perfused vest than for the other conditions, while the cool pad vest felt initially cooler than control. However, comfort and RPE scores were similar. We conclude that the cooling effect of both tested systems, mainly providing a (temporally) cooler thermal sensation, was limited and did not meet the expectations.

@highlight Two cooling systems were tested under a firefighter suit, exercising in the heat.
@highlight The systems featured cooled pads or a cold water perfusion system.
@highlight The cool pads initially improved thermal sensation, the perfused system continually.
@highlight Neither system reduced core temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion or comfort.
@highlight The tested cooling systems did not meet the cooling expectations.
