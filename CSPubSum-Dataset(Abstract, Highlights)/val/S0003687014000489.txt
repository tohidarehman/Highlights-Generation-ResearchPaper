 This study investigated the effects that a form fitted, moisture-wicking fabric shirt, promoted to have improved evaporative and ventilation properties, has on the physiological and perceptual responses during exercise in the heat. Ten healthy male participants completed two heat stress tests consisting of 45 min of exercise (50% VO2peak) in a hot environment (33 °C, 60% RH). One heat stress test was conducted with the participant wearing a 100% cotton short sleeved t-shirt and the other heat stress test was conducted with the participant wearing a short sleeved synthetic shirt (81% polyester and 19% elastane). Rectal temperature was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the synthetic condition during the last 15 min of exercise. Furthermore, the synthetic polyester shirt retained less sweat (P < 0.05). As exercise duration increases, the ventilation and evaporation properties of the synthetic garment may prove beneficial in the preservation of body temperature during exercise in the heat.

@highlight We explore the impact of clothing on the thermoregulatory responses.
@highlight A moisture-wicking shirt lowers core temperature during exercise in the heat.
@highlight Cotton shirts have higher regain properties than moisture-wicking fabric shirts.
@highlight Shirts with higher air permeability can aid in lowering core temperature.
@highlight Differing shirt characteristics do not alter the perceptual responses to exercise.
