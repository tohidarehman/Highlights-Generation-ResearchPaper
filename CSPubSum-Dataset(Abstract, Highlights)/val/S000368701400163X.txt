 The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between physical load and musculoskeletal complaints in dentistry and to analyze the prevalence and severity of such complaints in nine anatomical regions using a cross-sectional study of 387 dentists from Natal, Brazil. The highest prevalence of complaints was related to the lower back (58.4%) and the lowest prevalence was found in the elbow (10.3%). In general, symptoms were classified as mild because they did not cause absence due to illness. Pain complaints were associated with the following characteristics: awkward posture at work; prolonged standing or sitting; strenuous position of the upper limbs; excessive tightening of the hands during clinical treatment; and the use of vibrating tools. The results of the present study suggest a high prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints in dentists that are significantly associated with variables related to their physical workload.
