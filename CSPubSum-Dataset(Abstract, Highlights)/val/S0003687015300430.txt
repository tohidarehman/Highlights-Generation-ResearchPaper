 Understanding how load carriage affects walking is important for people with a lower extremity amputation who may use different strategies to accommodate to the additional weight. Nine unilateral traumatic transtibial amputees (K4-level) walked over four surfaces (level-ground, uneven ground, incline, decline) with and without a 24.5Â kg backpack. Center of pressure (COP) and total force were analyzed from F-Scan insole pressure sensor data. COP parameters were greater on the intact limb than on the prosthetic limb, which was likely a compensation for the loss of ankle control. Double support time (DST) was greater when walking with a backpack. Although longer DST is often considered a strategy to enhance stability and/or reduce loading forces, changes in DST were only moderately correlated with changes in peak force. High functioning transtibial amputees were able to accommodate to a standard backpack load and to maintain COP progression, even when walking over different surfaces.

@highlight Examined amputee gait with and without a backpack load, over multiple surfaces.
@highlight COP and total force were similar when walking with and without a backpack load.
@highlight Transtibial amputees had more deviations in COP on the intact limb.
@highlight High functioning amputees are not limited by a backpack load on the tested tasks.
