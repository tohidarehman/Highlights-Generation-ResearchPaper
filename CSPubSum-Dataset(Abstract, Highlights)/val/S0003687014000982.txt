 Most older persons with dementia living in nursing homes spend their days without engaging in much physical activity. This study therefore looked at the influence that the environment has on their level of physical activity, by reviewing empirical studies that measured the effects of environmental stimuli on the physical activity of nursing home residents suffering from dementia. The electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were used for the search. The search covered studies published between January 1993 and December 2012, and revealed 3187 abstracts. 326 studies were selected as potentially relevant; of these, 24 metÂ all the inclusion criteria. Positive results on the residents' levels of physical activity were found for music, a homelike environment and functional modifications. Predominantly positive results were also found for the small-scale group living concepts. Mixed results were found for bright or timed light, the multisensory environment and differences in the building footprint.

@highlight Dementia patients (90%) who are residing in the nursing home environment remain physically passive for most of the day.
@highlight Apathy negatively influences the residents' physical and cognitive well-being and therefore quality of life.
@highlight The environmental elements of timed bright light and small-scale living concepts stimulate residents' physical activity.
@highlight The intervention studies with background music differed strongly in scientific rigor, but showed promising results.
@highlight More research is necessary to draw conclusions for a homelike interior, functional modifications, and building footprint.
