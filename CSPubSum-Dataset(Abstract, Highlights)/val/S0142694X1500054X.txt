 It is essential that graphic design is visually clear and accessible. However, evidence suggests that a lack of consideration is given to visual accessibility in print-based graphic design. Furthermore, effective client窶電esigner communication is a vital component in this. This paper investigates current graphic design practice, with regard to visual accessibility, specifically focussing on client窶電esigner communication. A survey of 122 graphic designers and clients identified that these two groups may not be communicating with each other effectively with regard to visual accessibility, and that there is a need to develop inclusive design tools to assist them with this. This paper adds a novel contribution to our limited understanding of visual accessibility in the UK's graphic design industry. Inaccessible graphic design is commonplace. From drug packaging  to software interfaces  it makes daily tasks difficult or even dangerous. Due in part to an ageing population, it now is estimated that two million people in the UK have some form of sight loss  with many more being affected by milder age-related visual problems. Furthermore, the introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act , and the Americans with Disabilities Act , result in strong legal, social responsibility and business drivers  to ensure that graphic design is visually accessible. However, designers report that a lack of client requests for visual accessibility limits the consideration they can give to it . Clients also hold the misconception that designers will take visual accessibility into account even if it is not in the brief . This suggests that designers and clients may not be communicating effectively. A widespread study of the graphic design industry is vital in determining what happens with regard to visual accessibility in practice. This paper presents the results of a survey of the graphic design industry. It investigated the factors that influence how important graphic designers and clients deem visual accessibility to be, the extent to which it is considered in practice, and the extent to which clients and designers communicate regarding visual accessibility. Inclusive design tools that aid client窶電esigner communication could provide an important supplement to existing tools, and result in a greater uptake of inclusive design in industry. This paper provides valuable insight into graphic design practice with regard to visual accessibility. It is hoped that this work, and subsequent research, will help to develop new procedures, processes and tools, to improve client窶電esigner communication and assist graphic designers in creating visually accessible designs.
