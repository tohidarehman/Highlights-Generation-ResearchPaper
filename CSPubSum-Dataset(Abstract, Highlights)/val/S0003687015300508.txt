 Walkway codes and standards are often created through consensus by committees based on a number of factors, including historical precedence, common practice, cost, and empirical data. The authors maintain that in the formulation of codes and standards that impact pedestrian safety, the results of pertinent scientific research should be given significant weight. This article examines many elements of common walkway codes and standards related to changes in level, stairways, stair handrails, and slip resistance. It identifies which portions are based on or supported by empirical data; and which could benefit from additional scientific research. This article identifies areas in which additional research, codes, and standards may be beneficial to enhance pedestrian safety.

@highlight Walkway safety standards should be substantially based on scientific research.
@highlight We identify portions of such standards that are supported by empirical data.
@highlight We identify parts of such standards that could benefit from more empirical data.
