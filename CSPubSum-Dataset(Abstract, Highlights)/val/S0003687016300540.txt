 Knife sharpness is imperative in meat cutting. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of knife blade steel quality with meat cuttersâ€™ individual ability to maintain the cutting edge sharp in an industrial production setting. Twelve meat cutters in two different companies using three different knives during normal production were studied in this quasi-experimental study. Methods included were measuring knife cutting force before and after knife use, time knives were used, ratings of sharpness and discomfort and interviews. Results showed that the meat cutters' skill of maintaining sharpness during work had a much larger effect on knife sharpness during work than the knife steel differences. The ability was also related to feelings of discomfort and to physical exertion. It was found that meat cutters using more knives were more likely to suffer from discomfort in the upper limbs, which is a risk for developing MSD.

@highlight The ability to maintain the cutting edge sharp is notably individual.
@highlight The knife quality influence on sharpness is inferior to meat cutters' influence.
@highlight Knife usage time is a relevant predictor for discomfort and ultimately MSD.
@highlight Beef cutting may require up to at least six freshly sharpened knives per day.
