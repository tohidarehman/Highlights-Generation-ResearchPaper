 In this paper, 4-node quadrilateral and 3-node triangular solid-shell elements are applied to drape simulations. With locking issues alleviated by the assumed natural strain method and plane-stress enforcement, static and dynamic drape problems are attempted by the quadrilateral element. If the drape is deep and the mesh density is inadequate, non-realistic sharp folds are predicted due to the non-physical interpenetration of top and bottom element surfaces. To avoid the interpenetration, a reversible adaptive subdivision based on the 1â€“4 splitting method is developed. To ensure displacement compatibility among elements at different subdivision levels, macro-transition elements are formed by quadrilateral and triangular solid-shell elements. To reduce the dynamic oscillation induced by newly inserted nodes, the discrete Kirchhoff condition is employed to determine the related nodal variables. Dynamic drape examples using adaptive meshing are presented. It can be seen that the predictions look realistic and deep drapes can be predicted with the interpenetration avoided yet the required number of nodes can be kept relatively small.
