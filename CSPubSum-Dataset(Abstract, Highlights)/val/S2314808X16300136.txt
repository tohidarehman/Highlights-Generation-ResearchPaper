 An all-optical flip-flop based on a nonlinear multi-section DFB semiconductor laser structure is proposed. Holding beam is not required for device's operation. A section of the DFB structure is detuned to prevent lasing in the “OFF” state, and it is accompanied with a negative nonlinear coefficient that is due to partial absorption of photons at Urbach tail. At a high light intensity in the structure the nonlinear coefficient reduces the detuning, and the device is in lasing state; “ON” state. The device is reset by an optical pulse at a shorter wavelength through cross gain modulation. The reset pulse is absorbed in a middle section in the device before reaching the detuned nonlinear section. The switching times between the states are in nanoseconds time scale.
