 Carrying a casualty on a stretcher is a critical task within military and emergency service occupations. This study evaluated the impact of manipulating carry speed and the object type in bilateral carries on the ability to predict performance and reflect the physical and physiological requirements of a unilateral stretcher carry. We demonstrated that three task-related predictive tests; a jerry can carry performed at 4.5 km h−1or 5.0 km h−1 and a kettle-bell carry performed at 5.0 km h−1 were strongly predictive of the physical and physiological demands of an individual participating as part of a four-person stretcher carry team. Therefore, bilateral predictive assessments have the utility for predicting the suitability of employees to effectively and safely conduct a four-person unilateral stretcher carry.

@highlight All bilateral carry tests had strong performance correlations to stretcher carriage.
@highlight Sensitivity and specificity analyses revealed good predictive ability of all tests.
@highlight Manipulating speed and object had minimal impact on predicting stretcher carriage.
@highlight Predictive equations are presented to set cut-scores for each test option.
