 Computer-aided diagnosis systems can play an important role in lowering the workload of clinical radiologists and reducing costs by automatically analyzing vast amounts of image data and providing meaningful and timely insights during the decision making process. In this paper, we present strategies on how to better manage the limited time of clinical radiologists in conjunction with predictive model diagnosis. We first introduce a metric for discriminating between the different categories of diagnostic complexity (such as easy versus hard) encountered when interpreting CT scans. Second, we propose to learn the diagnostic complexity using a classification approach based on low-level image features automatically extracted from pixel data. We then show how this classification can be used to decide how to best allocate additional radiologists to interpret a case based on its diagnosis category. Using a lung nodule image dataset, we determined that, by a simple division of cases into hard and easy to diagnose, the number of interpretations can be distributed to significantly lower the cost with limited loss in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we show that with just a few low-level image features (18% of the original set) we are able to determine the easy from hard cases for a significant subset (66%) of the lung nodule image data.
