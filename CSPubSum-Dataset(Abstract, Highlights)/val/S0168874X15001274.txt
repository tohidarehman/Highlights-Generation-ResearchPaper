 The effect of geometric and ambient parameters on static structural integrity of solder joints in surface mount resistor assembled on printed circuit board (PCB) is investigated to improve the thermo-fatigue reliability of the joints and components. The optimisation of resistor thickness (RT ) and components standoff height (CSH) in a range of operating homologous temperature (TH ) is poised to produce optimal assembly which could accumulate least strain energy density (ωacc ) in resistor joints and consequently possesses longer cycles to failure (N f). Taguchi design of experiment (DOE), , is used to generate nine designs and finite element modelling (FEM) is employed to simulate the responses of the assemblies to reliability influencing factors (RIFs). The Garofalo–Arrhenius constitutive creep relation is utilised to model high-temperature response of the soldered joints while the concept of signal to noise ratio and statistics are used to determine the optimal design. The results show that settings of lowest RT , highest CSH and TH of 0.86 produce optimal assembly which demonstrates potential of reducing ωacc and increasing Nf of the best design of DOE by 46.9% and 88.3%, respectively. More results show that the nature of finite element model and difference in magnitude of thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of two bodies bonded together and which experience the same temperature change determine the degree of damage on the interface with the former being more determining. The authors propose the model (where: M/N, K 1, K 2 are isotropic materials, CTE and geometric ratio, respectively) as a quick tool to rank and compare boundary damage in a multi-isotropic-material joining. reliability influencing factors thickness of resistor component standoff height homologous temperature solder joints reliability influencing factors printed circuit board contract electronics manufacturer flip chip on board accelerated temperature cycle chip scale package static structural factors melting temperature excursion temperatures fatigue indicator parameter resistor length resistor width shortest distance between pads copper pad width PCB length PCB thickness Young's moduli (in x, y and z) Poisson ratios (in xy, xz, yz) highly accelerated temperature cycle creep strain rate von Mises effective stress universal gas constant. displacement in the vertical direction cubic expansitivity component or Material (A, B) coefficient of linear expansion change in length change in width change in thickness RIFs (designated as A, B or C) Number of level in the experiment. effect of factor j minimum value of factor j number of cycle to failure factor level electronic control units high-pressure-high-temperature signal to noise ratio flip chip resistor component model 103 surface mount components waste from electrical and electronic equipment original equipment manufacturers finite element analysis finite element modelling thickness of intermetallic compound ambient temperature number of measurement value of the ith measured response accumulated strain energy density termination length termination thickness copper pad length copper pad thickness PCB width printed wire board coefficient of thermal expansions (in x, y and z) shear moduli (in xy,xz,yz) Garofalo creep parameters change in temperature activation energy absolute temperature volume of material change in volume damage on a material length width thickness CTE ratio of two materials mean of S/N ratio ball grid array maximum value of factor j mean-time-to-failure geometric ratio of two materials
