 This study developed an ergonomic evaluation system for the design of high-altitude partial pressure suits (PPSs). A total of twenty-one Chinese males participated in the experiment which tested three types of ergonomics indices (manipulative mission, operational reach and operational strength) were studied using a three-dimensional video-based motion capture system, a target-pointing board, a hand dynamometer, and a step-tread apparatus. In total, 36 ergonomics indices were evaluated and optimized using regression and fitting analysis. Some indices that were found to be linearly related and redundant were removed from the study. An optimal ergonomics index system was established that can be used to conveniently and quickly evaluate the performance of different pressurized/non-pressurized suit designs. The resulting ergonomics index system will provide a theoretical basis and practical guidance for mission planners, suit designers and engineers to design equipment for human use, and to aid in assessing partial pressure suits. personal protective clothing target pointing pull down the veil drawing-back a leg controlling-joysticks accomplishing time of task buttons buttons and switches right wrist bar thumb side right wrist bar pinkie side right knee right ankle left elbow right elbow right shoulder AT of right arm with B group for TP AT of left arm with BS group for TP AT of right arm with BS group for TP inverse orientation AT of right arm with BS group for TP partial pressure suit movement of RWRA for PDV flexion angle of RKNE joint for DBL movement of RANK for DBL pushing forward of RWRA for CJ pushing left of RWRA for CJ pushing right of RWRA for CJ maximum vertical movement of RELB for lateral lift maximum vertical movement of RELB for forward extension maximum vertical movement of RELB for backward extension maximum horizontal movement of RELB for adduction maximum horizontal movement of RELB for abduction range of motion of RSHO in the coronal plane motion angle of RELB joint movement of RKNE range of motion of right hip joint movement of LELB movement of RELB maximum grip strength
